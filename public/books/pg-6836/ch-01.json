WODEHOUSE\r\n\r\n1921\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the curtained windows of the furnished apartment which Mrs.\r\nHorace Hignett had rented for her stay in New York rays of golden\r\nsunlight peeped in like the foremost spies of some advancing army. It\r\nwas a fine summer morning. The hands of the Dutch clock in the hall\r\npointed to thirteen minutes past nine; those of the ormolu clock in the\r\nsitting-room to eleven minutes past ten; those of the carriage clock on\r\nthe bookshelf to fourteen minutes to six. In other words, it was\r\nexactly eight; and Mrs. Hignett acknowledged the fact by moving her\r\nhead on the pillow, opening her eyes, and sitting up in bed. She always\r\nwoke at eight precisely.\r\n\r\nWas this Mrs. Hignett _the_ Mrs. Hignett, the world-famous writer\r\non Theosophy, the author of \"The Spreading Light,\" \"What of the\r\nMorrow,\" and all the rest of that well-known series? I'm glad you asked\r\nme. Yes, she was. She had come over to America on a lecturing tour.\r\n\r\nThe year 1921, it will be remembered, was a trying one for the\r\ninhabitants of the United States. Every boat that arrived from England\r\nbrought a fresh swarm of British lecturers to the country. Novelists,\r\npoets, scientists, philosophers, and plain, ordinary bores; some herd\r\ninstinct seemed to affect them all simultaneously. It was like one of\r\nthose great race movements of the Middle Ages. Men and women of widely\r\ndiffering views on religion, art, politics, and almost every other\r\nsubject; on this one point the intellectuals of Great Britain were\r\nsingle-minded, that there was easy money to be picked up on the lecture\r\nplatforms of America and that they might just as well grab it as the\r\nnext person.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett had come over with the first batch of immigrants; for,\r\nspiritual as her writings were, there was a solid streak of business\r\nsense in this woman and she meant to get hers while the getting was\r\ngood. She was half way across the Atlantic with a complete itinerary\r\nbooked before 90 per cent. of the poets and philosophers\r\nhad finished sorting out their clean collars and getting their\r\nphotographs taken for the passport.\r\n\r\nShe had not left England without a pang, for departure had involved\r\nsacrifices. More than anything else in the world she loved her charming\r\nhome, Windles, in the county of Hampshire, for so many years the seat\r\nof the Hignett family. Windles was as the breath of life to her. Its\r\nshady walks, its silver lake, its noble elms, the old grey stone of its\r\nwalls--these were bound up with her very being. She felt that she\r\nbelonged to Windles, and Windles to her. Unfortunately, as a matter of\r\ncold, legal accuracy, it did not. She did but hold it in trust for her\r\nson, Eustace, until such time as he should marry and take possession of\r\nit himself. There were times when the thought of Eustace marrying and\r\nbringing a strange woman to Windles chilled Mrs. Hignett to her very\r\nmarrow. Happily, her firm policy of keeping her son permanently under\r\nher eye at home and never permitting him to have speech with a female\r\nbelow the age of fifty had averted the peril up till now.\r\n\r\nEustace had accompanied his mother to America. It was his faint snores\r\nwhich she could hear in the adjoining room, as, having bathed\r\nand dressed, she went down the hall to where breakfast awaited\r\nher. She smiled tolerantly. She had never desired to convert her son to\r\nher own early rising habits, for, apart from not allowing him to call\r\nhis soul his own, she was an indulgent mother. Eustace would get up at\r\nhalf-past nine, long after she had finished breakfast, read her mail,\r\nand started her duties for the day.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was on the table in the sitting-room, a modest meal of rolls,\r\ncereal, and imitation coffee. Beside the pot containing this hell-brew\r\nwas a little pile of letters. Mrs. Hignett opened them as she ate. The\r\nmajority were from disciples and dealt with matters of purely\r\ntheosophical interest. There was an invitation from the Butterfly Club\r\nasking her to be the guest of honour at their weekly dinner. There was\r\na letter from her brother Mallaby--Sir Mallaby Marlowe, the eminent\r\nLondon lawyer--saying that his son Sam, of whom she had never approved,\r\nwould be in New York shortly, passing through on his way back to\r\nEngland, and hoping that she would see something of him. Altogether a\r\ndull mail. Mrs. Hignett skimmed through it without interest, setting\r\naside one or two of the letters for Eustace, who acted as her unpaid\r\nsecretary, to answer later in the day.\r\n\r\nShe had just risen from the table when there was a sound of voices in\r\nthe hall, and presently the domestic staff, a gaunt Irish lady of\r\nadvanced years, entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Ma'am, there was a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett was annoyed. Her mornings were sacred.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you tell him I was not to be disturbed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not. I loosed him into the parlor.\"\r\n\r\nThe staff remained for a moment in melancholy silence, then resumed.\r\n\"He says he's your nephew. His name's Marlowe.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett experienced no diminution of her annoyance. She had not\r\nseen her nephew Sam for ten years and would have been willing to extend\r\nthe period. She remembered him as an untidy small boy who, once or\r\ntwice, during his school holidays, had disturbed the cloistral peace of\r\nWindles with his beastly presence. However, blood being thicker than\r\nwater, and all that sort of thing, she supposed she would have to give\r\nhim five minutes. She went into the sitting-room and found there a\r\nyoung man who looked more or less like all other young men, though\r\nperhaps rather fitter than most. He had grown a good deal since she had\r\nlast met him, as men will do between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five,\r\nand was now about six feet in height, about forty inches round the\r\nchest, and in weight about one hundred and eighty pounds. He had a\r\nbrown and amiable face, marred at the moment by an expression of\r\ndiscomfort somewhat akin to that of a cat in a strange alley.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Aunt Adeline!\" he said awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Samuel!\" said Mrs. Hignett.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Mrs. Hignett, who was not fond of young men and\r\ndisliked having her mornings broken into, was thinking that he had\r\nnot improved in the slightest degree since their last meeting; and Sam,\r\nwho imagined that he had long since grown to man's estate and put off\r\nchildish things, was embarrassed to discover that his aunt still\r\naffected him as of old. That is to say, she made him feel as if he had\r\nomitted to shave, and, in addition to that, had swallowed some drug\r\nwhich had caused him to swell unpleasantly, particularly about the\r\nhands and feet.\r\n\r\n\"Jolly morning,\" said Sam, perseveringly.\r\n\r\n\"So I imagine. I have not yet been out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought I'd look in and see how you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was very kind of you. The morning is my busy time, but ... yes,\r\nthat was very kind of you!\"\r\n\r\nThere was another pause.\r\n\r\n\"How do you like America?\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I dislike it exceedingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes? Well, of course some people do. Prohibition and all that.\r\nPersonally, it doesn't affect me. I can take it or leave it alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reason I dislike America--\" began Mrs. Hignett bridling.\r\n\r\n\"I like it myself,\" said Sam. \"I've had a wonderful time. Everybody's\r\ntreated me like a rich uncle. I've been in Detroit, you know, and they\r\npractically gave me the city and asked me if I'd like another to take\r\nhome in my pocket. Never saw anything like it. I might have been the\r\nmissing heir. I think America's the greatest invention on record.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what brought you to America?\" said Mrs. Hignett, unmoved by this\r\nrhapsody.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I came over to play golf. In a tournament, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely at your age,\" said Mrs. Hignett, disapprovingly, \"you could be\r\nbetter occupied. Do you spend your whole time playing golf?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. I hunt a bit and shoot a bit and I swim a good lot, and I\r\nstill play football occasionally.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder your father does not insist on your doing some useful work.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is beginning to harp on the subject rather. I suppose I shall take\r\na stab at it sooner or later. Father says I ought to get married, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is perfectly right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose old Eustace will be getting hitched up one of these days?\"\r\nsaid Sam.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett started violently.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, he's a romantic sort of fellow. Writes poetry and all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no likelihood at all of Eustace marrying. He is of a shy and\r\nretiring temperament and sees few women. He is almost a recluse.\"\r\n\r\nSam was aware of this and had frequently regretted it. He had always\r\nbeen fond of his cousin and in that half-amused and rather patronising\r\nway in which men of thews and sinews are fond of the weaker brethren\r\nwho run more to pallor and intellect; and he had always felt that if\r\nEustace had not had to retire to Windles to spend his life with a woman\r\nwhom from his earliest years he had always considered the Empress of\r\nthe Wash-outs much might have been made of him. Both at school and at\r\nOxford, Eustace had been--if not a sport--at least a decidedly cheery\r\nold bean. Sam remembered Eustace at school breaking gas globes with a\r\nslipper in a positively rollicking manner. He remembered him at Oxford\r\nplaying up to him manfully at the piano on the occasion when he had\r\ndone that imitation of Frank Tinney which had been such a hit at the\r\nTrinity smoker. Yes, Eustace had had the makings of a pretty sound egg,\r\nand it was too bad that he had allowed his mother to coop him up down\r\nin the country miles away from anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Eustace is returning to England on Saturday,\" said Mrs. Hignett. She\r\nspoke a little wistfully. She had not been parted from her son since he\r\nhad come down from Oxford; and she would have liked to keep him with\r\nher till the end of her lecturing tour. That, however, was out of the\r\nquestion. It was imperative that, while she was away, he should be at\r\nWindles. Nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the\r\nmercy of servants who might trample over the flower-beds, scratch the\r\npolished floors, and forget to cover up the canary at night. \"He sails\r\non the _Atlantic_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's splendid,\" said Sam. \"I'm sailing on the _Atlantic_ myself.\r\nI'll go down to the office and see if we can't have a state-room\r\ntogether. But where is he going to live when he gets to England?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he going to live? Why, at Windles, of course. Where else?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you were letting Windles for the summer?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett stared.\r\n\r\n\"Letting Windles!\" She spoke as one might address a lunatic. \"What put\r\nthat extraordinary idea into your head?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought father said something about your letting the place to some\r\nAmerican.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently, even\r\nsnappishly, in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake. He\r\ncould not know that the subject of letting Windles for the summer was\r\none which had long since begun to infuriate Mrs. Hignett. People had\r\ncertainly asked her to let Windles. In fact people had pestered her. There\r\nwas a rich fat man, an American named Bennett, whom she had met just\r\nbefore sailing at her brother's house in London. Invited down to Windles\r\nfor the day, Mr. Bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged\r\nher to name her own price. Not content with this, he had pursued her\r\nwith his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on\r\nthe ocean, and had not given up the struggle even when she reached New\r\nYork. He had egged on a friend of his, a Mr. Mortimer, to continue the\r\npersecution in that city. And, this very morning, among the letters on\r\nMrs. Hignett's table, the buff envelope of a cable from Mr. Bennett had\r\npeeped out, nearly spoiling her breakfast. No wonder, then, that Sam's\r\nallusion to the affair had caused the authoress of \"The Spreading\r\nLight\" momentarily to lose her customary calm.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will induce me ever to let Windles,\" she said with finality,\r\nand rose significantly. Sam, perceiving that the audience was at an\r\nend--and glad of it--also got up.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think I'll be going down and seeing about that state-room,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I am a little busy just now, preparing notes for my next\r\nlecture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, yes. Mustn't interrupt you. I suppose you're having a great\r\ntime, gassing away--I mean--well, good-bye!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett, frowning, for the interview had ruffled her and disturbed\r\nthat equable frame of mind which is so vital to the preparation of\r\nlectures on Theosophy, sat down at the writing-table and began to go\r\nthrough the notes which she had made overnight. She had hardly\r\nsucceeded in concentrating herself when the door opened to admit the\r\ndaughter of Erin once more.\r\n\r\n\"Ma'am there was a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is intolerable!\" cried Mrs. Hignett. \"Did you tell him that I was\r\nbusy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not. I loosed him into the dining-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he a reporter from one of the newspapers?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not. He has spats and a tall-shaped hat. His name is Bream\r\nMortimer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bream Mortimer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. He handed me a bit of a kyard, but I dropped it, being\r\nslippy from the dishes.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett strode to the door with a forbidding expression. This, as\r\nshe had justly remarked, was intolerable. She remembered Bream\r\nMortimer. He was the son of the Mr. Mortimer who was the friend of the\r\nMr. Bennett who wanted Windles. This visit could only have to do with\r\nthe subject of Windles, and she went into the dining-room in a state of\r\ncold fury, determined to squash the Mortimer family once and for all.\r\n\r\nBream Mortimer was tall and thin. He had small, bright eyes and a\r\nsharply curving nose. He looked much more like a parrot than most\r\nparrots do. It gave strangers a momentary shock of surprise when they\r\nsaw Bream Mortimer in restaurants eating roast beef. They had the\r\nfeeling that he would have preferred sun-flower seeds.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, Mrs. Hignett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please sit down.\"\r\n\r\nBream Mortimer sat down. He looked as though he would rather have\r\nhopped on to a perch, but he sat down. He glanced about the room with\r\ngleaming, excited eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Hignett, I must have a word with you alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ having a word with me alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know how to begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me help you. It is quite impossible. I will never consent.\"\r\n\r\nBream Mortimer started.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have heard!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard about nothing else since I met Mr. Bennett in London. Mr.\r\nBennett talked about nothing else. Your father talked about nothing\r\nelse. And now,\" cried Mrs. Hignett fiercely, \"you come and try to\r\nreopen the subject. Once and for all nothing will alter my decision. No\r\nmoney will induce me to let my house.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't come about that!\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not come about Windles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then will you kindly tell me why you have come?\"\r\n\r\nBream Mortimer looked embarrassed. He wriggled a little and moved his\r\narms as if he were trying to flap them.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I'm not a man who butts into other people's\r\naffairs.\" ... He stopped.\r\n\r\n\"No?\" said Mrs. Hignett.\r\n\r\nBream began again.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a man who gossips with servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a man who....\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett was never a very patient woman.\r\n\r\n\"Let us take all your negative qualities for granted,\" she said curtly.\r\n\"I have no doubt that there are many things which you do not do. Let us\r\nconfine ourselves to issues of definite importance. What is it, if you\r\nhave no objection to concentrating your attention on that for a moment,\r\nthat you wish to see me about?\"\r\n\r\n\"This marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your son's marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"My son is not married.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but he's going to be. At eleven o'clock this morning at the Little\r\nChurch Round the Corner!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett stared.\r\n\r\n\"Are you mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not any too well pleased, I'm bound to say,\" admitted Mr.\r\nMortimer. \"You see, darn it all, I'm in love with the girl myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have been for years. I'm one of those silent, patient fellows who hang\r\naround and look a lot, but never tell their love....\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this girl who has entrapped my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always been one of those men who....\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mortimer! With your permission we will take your positive\r\nqualities, also, for granted. In fact, we will not discuss you at all.\r\nYou come to me with this absurd story....\"\r\n\r\n\"Not absurd. Honest fact. I had it from my valet, who had it from her\r\nmaid, and, though I'm not a man who gossips with servants, I'm bound to\r\nsay....\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you please tell me who is the girl my misguided son wishes to\r\nmarry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that I'd call him misguided,\" said Mr. Mortimer, as one\r\ndesiring to be fair, \"I think he's a right smart picker! She's such a\r\ncorking girl, you know. We were children together, and I've loved her\r\nfor years. Ten years at least. But you know how it is--somehow one\r\nnever seems to get in line for a proposal. I thought I saw an opening\r\nin the summer of nineteen-twelve, but it blew over. I'm not one of\r\nthese smooth, dashing guys, you see, with a great line of talk. I'm\r\nnot....\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will kindly,\" said Mrs. Hignett impatiently, \"postpone this\r\nessay in psycho-analysis to some future occasion I shall be greatly\r\nobliged. I am waiting to hear the name of the girl my son wishes to\r\nmarry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I told you?\" said Mr. Mortimer, surprised. \"That's odd. I\r\nhaven't! It's funny how one doesn't do the things one thinks one does.\r\nI'm the sort of man...\"\r\n\r\n\"What is her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bennett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bennett? Wilhelmina Bennett? The daughter of Mr. Rufus Bennett? The\r\nred-haired girl I met at lunch one day at your father's house?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it. You're a great guesser. I think you ought to stop the\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\"\r\n\r\n\"The marriage would be unsuitable in every way. Miss Bennett and my son\r\ndo not vibrate on the same plane.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. I've noticed it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their auras are not the same colour.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I've thought that once,\" said Bream Mortimer, \"I've thought it a\r\nhundred times. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've thought it.\r\nNot the same colour! That's the whole thing in a nutshell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am much obliged to you for coming and telling me of this. I shall\r\ntake immediate steps.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good! But what's the procedure? How are you going to form a\r\nflying-wedge and buck-centre? It's getting late. She'll be waiting at\r\nthe church at eleven. With bells on,\" said Mr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"Eustace will not be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think you can fix it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eustace will not be there,\" repeated Mrs. Hignett.\r\n\r\nBream Mortimer hopped down from his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've taken a weight off my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"A mind, I should imagine, scarcely constructed to bear great weights.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be going. Haven't had breakfast yet. Too worried to eat\r\nbreakfast. Relieved now. This is where three eggs and a rasher of ham\r\nget cut off in their prime. I feel I can rely on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll say good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean really good-bye. I'm sailing for England on Saturday on the\r\n_Atlantic_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? My son will be your fellow-traveller.\"\r\n\r\nBream Mortimer looked somewhat apprehensive.\r\n\r\n\"You won't tell him that I was the one who spilled the beans?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't wise him up that I threw a spanner into the machinery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't tell him that I crabbed his act--gave the thing away--gummed\r\nthe game?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not mention your chivalrous intervention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chivalrous?\" said Bream Mortimer doubtfully. \"I don't know that I'd\r\ncall it absolutely chivalrous. Of course, all's fair in love and war.\r\nWell, I'm glad you're going to keep my share in the business under your\r\nhat. It might have been awkward meeting him on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not likely to meet Eustace on board. He is a very indifferent\r\nsailor and spends most of his time in his cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good! Saves a lot of awkwardness. Well, good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye. When you reach England remember me to your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't have forgotten you,\" said Bream Mortimer confidently. He did\r\nnot see how it was humanly possible for anyone to forget this woman.\r\nShe was like a celebrated chewing-gum. The taste lingered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett was a woman of instant and decisive action. Even while her\r\nlate visitor was speaking schemes had begun to form in her mind like\r\nbubbles rising to the surface of a rushing river. By the time the door\r\nhad closed behind Bream Mortimer she had at her disposal no fewer than\r\nseven, all good. It took her but a moment to select the best and\r\nsimplest. She tip-toed softly to her son's room. Rhythmic snores\r\ngreeted her listening ears. She opened the door and went noiselessly\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Star liner _Atlantic_ lay at her pier with steam up and\r\ngangway down ready for her trip to Southampton. The hour of departure\r\nwas near and there was a good deal of mixed activity going on. Sailors\r\nfiddled about with ropes. Junior officers flitted to and fro.\r\nWhite-jacketed stewards wrestled with trunks. Probably the captain,\r\nthough not visible, was also employed on some useful work of a nautical\r\nnature and not wasting his time. Men, women, boxes, rugs, dogs, flowers\r\nand baskets of fruit were flowing on board in a steady stream.\r\n\r\nThe usual drove of citizens had come to see the travellers off. There\r\nwere men on the passenger-list who were being seen off by fathers, by\r\nmothers, by sisters, by cousins, and by aunts. In the steerage there was\r\nan elderly Jewish lady who was being seen off by exactly thirty-seven\r\nof her late neighbours in Rivington Street. And two men in the\r\nsecond cabin were being seen off by detectives, surely the crowning\r\ncompliment a great nation can bestow. The cavernous customs shed was\r\ncongested with friends and relatives, and Sam Marlowe, heading for the\r\ngang-plank, was only able to make progress by employing all the muscle\r\nand energy which Nature had bestowed upon him, and which during the\r\ntwenty-five years of his life he had developed by athletic exercise.\r\nHowever, after some minutes of silent endeavour, now driving his shoulder\r\ninto the midriff of some obstructing male, now courteously lifting some\r\nstout female off his feet, he had succeeded in struggling to within a few\r\nyards of his goal, when suddenly a sharp pain shot through his right arm\r\nand he spun round with a cry.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Sam that he had been bitten, and this puzzled him, for New\r\nYork crowds, though they may shove and jostle, rarely bite.\r\n\r\nHe found himself face to face with an extraordinarily pretty girl.\r\n\r\nShe was a red-haired girl with the beautiful ivory skin which goes with\r\nred hair. Her eyes, though they were under the shadow of her hat, and\r\nhe could not be certain, he diagnosed as green, or maybe blue, or\r\npossibly grey. Not that it mattered, for he had a catholic taste in\r\nfeminine eyes. So long as they were large and bright, as were\r\nthe specimens under his immediate notice, he was not the man to\r\nquibble about a point of colour. Her nose was small, and on the very\r\ntip of it there was a tiny freckle. Her mouth was nice and wide, her\r\nchin soft and round. She was just about the height which every girl\r\nought to be. Her figure was trim, her feet tiny, and she wore one of\r\nthose dresses of which a man can say no more than that they look pretty\r\nwell all right.\r\n\r\nNature abhors a vacuum. Samuel Marlowe was a susceptible young man, and\r\nfor many a long month his heart had been lying empty, all swept and\r\ngarnished, with \"Welcome\" on the mat. This girl seemed to rush in and\r\nfill it. She was not the prettiest girl he had ever seen. She was the\r\nthird prettiest. He had an orderly mind, one capable of classifying and\r\ndocketing girls. But there was a subtle something about her, a sort of\r\nhow-shall-one-put-it, which he had never encountered before. He\r\nswallowed convulsively. His well-developed chest swelled beneath its\r\ncovering of blue flannel and invisible stripe. At last, he told\r\nhimself, he was in love, really in love, and at first sight, too, which\r\nmade it all the more impressive. He doubted whether in the whole\r\ncourse of history anything like this had ever happened before to\r\nanybody. Oh, to clasp this girl to him and--\r\n\r\nBut she had bitten him in the arm. That was hardly the right spirit.\r\nThat, he felt, constituted an obstacle.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nWell, of course, if she regretted her rash act ... After all, an\r\nimpulsive girl might bite a man in the arm in the excitement of the\r\nmoment and still have a sweet, womanly nature....\r\n\r\n\"The crowd seems to make Pinky-Boodles so nervous.\"\r\n\r\nSam might have remained mystified, but at this juncture there proceeded\r\nfrom a bundle of rugs in the neighbourhood of the girl's lower ribs a\r\nsharp yapping sound, of such a calibre as to be plainly audible over\r\nthe confused noise of Mamies who were telling Sadies to be sure and\r\nwrite, of Bills who were instructing Dicks to look up old Joe in Paris\r\nand give him their best, and of all the fruit-boys, candy-boys,\r\nmagazine-boys, American-flag-boys, and telegraph boys who were honking\r\ntheir wares on every side.\r\n\r\n\"I hope he didn't hurt you much. You're the third person he's bitten\r\nto-day.\" She kissed the animal in a loving and congratulatory way on the\r\ntip of his black nose. \"Not counting bell-boys, of course,\" she added.\r\nAnd then she was swept from him in the crowd and he was left thinking\r\nof all the things he might have said--all those graceful, witty,\r\ningratiating things which just make a bit of difference on these\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nHe had said nothing. Not a sound, exclusive of the first sharp yowl of\r\npain, had proceeded from him. He had just goggled. A rotten exhibition!\r\nPerhaps he would never see this girl again. She looked the sort of girl\r\nwho comes to see friends off and doesn't sail herself. And what memory\r\nof him would she retain? She would mix him up with the time when she\r\nwent to visit the deaf-and-dumb hospital.\r\n\r\nSam reached the gang-plank, showed his ticket, and made his way through\r\nthe crowd of passengers, passengers' friends, stewards, junior\r\nofficers, and sailors who infested the deck. He proceeded down the main\r\ncompanion-way, through a rich smell of india-rubber and mixed pickles,\r\nas far as the dining-saloon: then turned down the narrow passage\r\nleading to his stateroom.\r\n\r\nStaterooms on ocean liners are curious things. When you see them on the\r\nchart in the passenger-office, with the gentlemanly clerk drawing rings\r\nround them in pencil, they seem so vast that you get the impression\r\nthat, after stowing away all your trunks, you will have room left over\r\nto do a bit of entertaining--possibly an informal dance or something.\r\nWhen you go on board you find that the place has shrunk to the\r\ndimensions of an undersized cupboard in which it would be impossible to\r\nswing a cat. And then, about the second day out, it suddenly expands\r\nagain. For one reason or another the necessity for swinging cats does\r\nnot arise and you find yourself quite comfortable.\r\n\r\nSam, balancing himself on the narrow, projecting ledge which the chart\r\nin the passenger-office had grandiloquently described as a lounge,\r\nbegan to feel the depression which marks the second phase. He almost\r\nwished now that he had not been so energetic in having his room changed\r\nin order to enjoy the company of his cousin Eustace. It was going to be\r\na tight fit. Eustace's bag was already in the cabin, and it seemed to\r\ntake up the entire fairway. Still, after all, Eustace was a good sort,\r\nand would be a cheerful companion. And Sam realised that if that girl\r\nwith the red hair was not a passenger on the boat he was going to have\r\nneed of diverting society.\r\n\r\nA footstep sounded in the passage outside. The door opened.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Eustace!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett nodded listlessly, sat down on his bag and emitted a\r\ndeep sigh. He was a small, fragile-looking young man with a pale,\r\nintellectual face. Dark hair fell in a sweep over his forehead. He\r\nlooked like a man who would write _vers libre_, as indeed he did.\r\n\"Hullo!\" he said, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\nSam regarded him blankly. He had not seen him for some years, but,\r\ngoing by his recollections of him at the University, he had expected\r\nsomething cheerier than this. In fact, he had rather been relying on\r\nEustace to be the life and soul of the party. The man sitting on the\r\nbag before him could hardly have filled that role at a gathering of\r\nRussian novelists.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth's the matter?\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"The matter?\" Eustace Hignett laughed mirthlessly. \"Oh, nothing.\r\nNothing much. Nothing to signify. Only my heart's broken.\" He eyed with\r\nconsiderable malignity the bottle of water in the rack above his head,\r\na harmless object provided by the White Star Company for clients who\r\nmight desire to clean their teeth during the voyage.\r\n\r\n\"If you would care to hear the story?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite short.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Soon after I arrived in America I met a girl....\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking of girls,\" said Marlowe with enthusiasm. \"I've just seen the\r\nonly one in the world that really amounts to anything. It was like\r\nthis. I was shoving my way through the mob on the dock, when\r\nsuddenly....\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell you my story, or will you tell me yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sorry! Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett scowled at the printed notice on the wall informing\r\noccupants of the stateroom that the name of their steward was J. B.\r\nMidgeley.\r\n\r\n\"She was an extraordinarily pretty girl....\"\r\n\r\n\"So was mine. I give you my honest word I never in all my life saw\r\nsuch....\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if you would prefer that I postponed my narrative?\" said\r\nEustace coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sorry! Carry on.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was an extraordinarily pretty girl....\"\r\n\r\n\"What was her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelmina Bennett. She was an extraordinarily pretty girl and highly\r\nintelligent. I read her all my poems and she appreciated them\r\nimmensely. She enjoyed my singing. My conversation appeared to interest\r\nher. She admired my....\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. You made a hit. Now get on with the rest of the story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bustle me,\" said Eustace querulously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know, the voyage only takes eight days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've forgotten where I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were saying what a devil of a chap she thought you. What happened?\r\nI suppose, when you actually came to propose, you found she was engaged\r\nto some other johnny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I asked her to be my wife, and she consented. We both\r\nagreed that a quiet wedding was what we wanted--she thought her father\r\nmight stop the thing if he knew, and I was dashed sure my mother\r\nwould--so we decided to get married without telling anybody. By now,\"\r\nsaid Eustace, with a morose glance at the porthole, \"I ought to have\r\nbeen on my honeymoon. Everything was settled. I had the license and\r\nthe parson's fee. I had been breaking in a new tie for the wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then you quarrelled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind. I wish you would stop trying to tell me the\r\nstory. I'm telling _you_. What happened was this: somehow--I can't\r\nmake out how--mother found out. And then, of course, it was all over.\r\nShe stopped the thing.\"\r\n\r\nSam was indignant. He thoroughly disliked his Aunt Adeline, and his\r\ncousin's meek subservience to her revolted him.\r\n\r\n\"Stopped it? I suppose she said, 'Now, Eustace, you mustn't!' and you\r\nsaid, 'Very well, mother!' and scratched the fixture?\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't say a word. She never has said a word. As far as that goes\r\nshe might never have heard anything about the marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you mean she stopped it?\"\r\n\r\n\"She pinched my trousers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pinched your trousers?\"\r\n\r\nEustace groaned. \"All of them! The whole bally lot! She gets up long\r\nbefore I do, and she must have come into my room and cleaned it out\r\nwhile I was asleep. When I woke up and started to dress I couldn't find\r\na solitary pair of bags anywhere in the whole place. I looked\r\neverywhere. Finally, I went into the sitting-room where she was writing\r\nletters and asked if she had happened to see any anywhere. She said she\r\nhad sent them all to be pressed. She said she knew I never went out in\r\nthe mornings--I don't as a rule--and they would be back at lunch-time.\r\nA fat lot of use that was! I had to be at the church at eleven. Well, I\r\ntold her I had a most important engagement with a man at eleven, and\r\nshe wanted to know what it was and I tried to think of something, but\r\nit sounded pretty feeble and she said I had better telephone to the man\r\nand put it off. I did it, too. Rang up the first number in the book and\r\ntold some fellow I had never seen in my life that I couldn't meet him!\r\nHe was pretty peeved, judging from what he said about my being on the\r\nwrong line. And mother listening all the time, and I knowing that she\r\nknew--something told me that she knew--and she knowing that I knew she\r\nknew--I tell you it was awful!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"She broke off the engagement. Apparently she waited at the church from\r\neleven till one-thirty and then began to get impatient. She wouldn't\r\nsee me when I called in the afternoon, but I got a letter from her\r\nsaying that what had happened was all for the best as she had been\r\nthinking it over and had come to the conclusion that she had made a\r\nmistake. She said something about my not being as dynamic as she had\r\nthought I was. She said that what she wanted was something more like\r\nLancelot or Sir Galahad, and would I look on the episode as closed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you explain about the trousers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It seemed to make things worse. She said that she could forgive a\r\nman anything except being ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you're well out of it,\" said Sam judicially. \"She can't have\r\nbeen much of a girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel that now. But it doesn't alter the fact that my life is ruined.\r\nI have become a woman-hater. It's an infernal nuisance, because\r\npractically all the poetry I have ever written rather went out of its\r\nway to boost women, and now I'll have to start all over again and\r\napproach the subject from another angle. Women! When I think how mother\r\nbehaved and how Wilhelmina treated me I wonder there isn't a law\r\nagainst them. 'What mighty ills have not been done by Woman! Who was it\r\nbetrayed the Capitol!'\"\r\n\r\n\"In Washington?\" said Sam puzzled. He had heard nothing of this. But\r\nthen he generally confined his reading of the papers to the sporting\r\npage.\r\n\r\n\"In Rome, you ass! Ancient Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as long ago as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was quoting from Thomas Otway's 'Orphan.' I wish I could write like\r\nOtway. He knew what he was talking about. 'Who was't betrayed the\r\nCapitol? A woman. Who lost Marc Antony the world? A woman. Who was the\r\ncause of a long ten years' war and laid at last old Troy in ashes?\r\nWoman! Destructive, damnable, deceitful woman!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, he may be right in a way. As regards some women, I\r\nmean. But the girl I met on the dock--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" said Eustace Hignett. \"If you have anything bitter and\r\nderogatory to say about women, say it and I will listen eagerly. But if\r\nyou merely wish to gibber about the ornamental exterior of some dashed\r\ngirl you have been fool enough to get attracted by, go and tell it to\r\nthe captain or the ship's cat or J. B. Midgeley. Do try to realise that\r\nI am a soul in torment! I am a ruin, a spent force, a man without a\r\nfuture! What does life hold for me? Love? I shall never love again.\r\nMy work? I haven't any. I think I shall take to drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking of that,\" said Sam, \"I suppose they open the bar directly we\r\npass the three-mile limit. How about a small one?\"\r\n\r\nEustace shook his head gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose I pass my time on board ship in gadding about and\r\nfeasting? Directly the vessel begins to move I go to bed and stay\r\nthere. As a matter of fact I think it would be wisest to go to bed now.\r\nDon't let me keep you if you want to go on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks to me,\" said Sam, \"as if I had been mistaken in thinking that\r\nyou were going to be a ray of sunshine on the voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ray of sunshine!\" said Eustace Hignett, pulling a pair of mauve\r\npyjamas out of the kit-bag. \"I'm going to be a volcano!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSam left the state-room and headed for the companion. He wanted to get\r\non deck and ascertain if that girl was still on board. About now the\r\nsheep would be separating from the goats: the passengers would be on\r\ndeck and their friends returning to the shore. A slight tremor on the\r\nboards on which he trod told him that this separation must have already\r\ntaken place. The ship was moving. He ran lightly up the companion. Was\r\nshe on board or was she not? The next few minutes would decide. He\r\nreached the top of the stairs and passed out on to the crowded deck.\r\nAnd, as he did so, a scream, followed by confused shouting, came from\r\nthe rail nearest the shore. He perceived that the rail was black with\r\npeople hanging over it. They were all looking into the water.\r\n\r\nSamuel Marlowe was not one of those who pass aloofly by when there is\r\nexcitement toward. If a horse fell down in the street, he was always\r\namong those present: and he was never too busy to stop and stare at a\r\nblank window on which were inscribed the words \"Watch this space!\" In\r\nshort, he was one of Nature's rubbernecks, and to dash to the rail and\r\nshove a fat man in a tweed cap to one side was with him the work of a\r\nmoment. He had thus an excellent view of what was going on--a view\r\nwhich he improved the next instant by climbing up and kneeling on the\r\nrail.\r\n\r\nThere was a man in the water, a man whose upper section, the only one\r\nvisible, was clad in a blue jersey. He wore a Derby hat, and from time\r\nto time as he battled with the waves, he would put up a hand and adjust\r\nthis more firmly on his head. A dressy swimmer.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he taken in this spectacle when Marlowe became aware of\r\nthe girl he had met on the dock. She was standing a few feet away\r\nleaning out over the rail with wide eyes and parted lips. Like\r\neverybody else she was staring into the water.\r\n\r\nAs Sam looked at her the thought crossed his mind that here was a\r\nwonderful chance of making the most tremendous impression on this girl.\r\nWhat would she not think of a man who, reckless of his own safety,\r\ndived in and went boldly to the rescue? And there were men, no doubt,\r\nwho would be chumps enough to do it, he thought, as he prepared to\r\nshift back to a position of greater safety.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the fat man in the tweed cap, incensed at having been\r\njostled out of the front row, made his charge. He had but been\r\ncrouching, the better to spring. Now he sprang. His full weight took\r\nSam squarely in the spine. There was an instant in which that young man\r\nhung, as it were, between sea and sky; then he shot down over the rail\r\nto join the man in the blue jersey, who had just discovered that his\r\nhat was not on straight and had paused to adjust it once more with a\r\nfew skilful touches of the finger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the brief interval of time which Marlowe had spent in the state-room,\r\nchatting with Eustace about the latter's bruised soul, some\r\nrather curious things had been happening above. Not extraordinary,\r\nperhaps, but curious. These must now be related. A story, if it is to\r\ngrip the reader, should, I am aware, go always forward. It should\r\nmarch. It should leap from crag to crag like the chamois of the Alps.\r\nIf there is one thing I hate, it is a novel which gets you interested\r\nin the hero in chapter one and then cuts back in chapter two to tell\r\nyou all about his grandfather. Nevertheless, at this point we must go\r\nback a space. We must return to the moment when, having deposited her\r\nPekinese dog in her state-room, the girl with the red hair came out\r\nagain on deck. This happened just about the time when Eustace Hignett\r\nwas beginning his narrative.\r\n\r\nBy now the bustle which precedes the departure of an ocean liner was at\r\nits height. Hoarse voices were crying, \"All for the shore!\" The gangway\r\nwas thronged with friends of passengers returning to land. The crowd on\r\nthe pier waved flags and handkerchiefs and shouted unintelligibly.\r\nMembers of the crew stood alertly by the gang-plank ready to draw it in\r\nas soon as the last seer-off had crossed it.\r\n\r\nThe girl went to the rail and gazed earnestly at the shore. There was\r\nan anxious expression on her face. She had the air of one who was\r\nwaiting for someone to appear. Her demeanour was that of Mariana at the\r\nMoated Grange. \"He cometh not!\" she seemed to be saying. She glanced at\r\nher wrist-watch, then scanned the dock once more.\r\n\r\nThere was a rattle as the gang-plank moved inboard and was deposited on\r\nthe deck. The girl uttered a little cry of dismay. Then suddenly her\r\nface brightened and she began to wave her arm to attract the attention\r\nof an elderly man with a red face made redder by exertion, who had just\r\nforced his way to the edge of the dock and was peering up at the\r\npassenger-lined rail.\r\n\r\nThe boat had now begun to move slowly out of its slip, backing into the\r\nriver. Ropes had been cast off, and an ever widening strip of water\r\nappeared between the vessel and the shore. It was now that the man on\r\nthe dock sighted the girl. She gesticulated at him. He gesticulated at\r\nher. She appeared helpless and baffled, but he showed himself a person\r\nof resource of the stuff of which great generals are made. Foch is just\r\nlike that, a bird at changing pre-conceived plans to suit the exigencies\r\nof the moment.\r\n\r\nThe man on the dock took from his pocket a pleasantly rotund wad of\r\ncurrency bills. He produced a handkerchief, swiftly tied up the bills\r\nin it, backed to give himself room, and then, with all the strength of\r\nhis arm, he hurled the bills in the direction of the deck. The action\r\nwas greeted by cheers from a warm-hearted populace. Your New York crowd\r\nloves a liberal provider.\r\n\r\nOne says that the man hurled the bills in the direction of the deck,\r\nand that was exactly what he did. But the years had robbed his\r\npitching-arm of the limber strength which, forty summers back, had made\r\nhim the terror of opposing boys' baseball teams. He still retained a\r\nfair control but he lacked steam. The handkerchief with its precious\r\ncontents shot in a graceful arc towards the deck, fell short by a good\r\nsix feet and dropped into the water, where it unfolded like a lily,\r\nsending twenty-dollar bills, ten-dollar bills, five-dollar bills, and\r\nan assortment of ones floating over the wavelets. The cheers of the\r\ncitizenry changed to cries of horror. The girl uttered a plaintive\r\nshriek. The boat moved on.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Mr. Oscar Swenson, one of the thriftiest\r\nsouls who ever came out of Sweden, perceived that the chance of a\r\nlifetime had arrived for adding substantially to his little savings. By\r\nprofession he was one of those men who eke out a precarious livelihood\r\nby rowing dreamily about the waterfront in skiffs. He was doing so now:\r\nand, as he sat meditatively in his skiff, having done his best to give\r\nthe liner a good send-off by paddling round her in circles, the\r\npleading face of a twenty-dollar bill peered up at him. Mr. Swenson was\r\nnot the man to resist the appeal. He uttered a sharp bark of ecstasy,\r\npressed his Derby hat firmly upon his brow and dived in. A moment later\r\nhe had risen to the surface and was gathering up money with both hands.\r\n\r\nHe was still busy with this congenial task when a tremendous splash at\r\nhis side sent him under again; and, rising for a second time, he\r\nobserved with not a little chagrin that he had been joined by a young\r\nman in a blue flannel suit with an invisible stripe.\r\n\r\n\"Svensk!\" exclaimed Mr. Swenson, or whatever it is that natives of\r\nSweden exclaim in moments of justifiable annoyance. He resented the\r\nadvent of this newcomer. He had been getting along fine and had had the\r\nsituation well in hand. To him Sam Marlowe represented Competition, and\r\nMr. Swenson desired no competitors in his treasure-seeking enterprise.\r\nHe travels, thought Mr. Swenson, the fastest who travels alone.\r\n\r\nSam Marlowe had a touch of the philosopher in him. He had the ability\r\nto adapt himself to circumstances. It had been no part of his plans to\r\ncome whizzing down off the rail into this singularly soup-like water\r\nwhich tasted in equal parts of oil and dead rats; but, now that he was\r\nhere he was prepared to make the best of the situation. Swimming, it\r\nhappened, was one of the things he did best, and somewhere among his\r\nbelongings at home was a tarnished pewter cup which he had won at\r\nschool in the \"Saving Life\" competition. He knew exactly what to do.\r\nYou get behind the victim and grab him firmly under his arms, and then\r\nyou start swimming on your back. A moment later the astonished Mr.\r\nSwenson, who, being practically amphibious, had not anticipated that\r\nanyone would have the cool impertinence to try and save him from\r\ndrowning, found himself seized from behind and towed vigorously away\r\nfrom a ten-dollar bill which he had almost succeeded in grasping. The\r\nspiritual agony caused by this assault rendered him mercifully dumb;\r\nthough, even had he contrived to utter the rich Swedish oaths which\r\noccurred to him, his remarks could scarcely have been heard, for the\r\ncrowd on the dock was cheering as one man. They had often paid good\r\nmoney to see far less gripping sights in the movies. They roared\r\napplause. The liner, meanwhile, continued to move stodgily out into\r\nmid-river.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback to these life-saving competitions at school,\r\nconsidered from the standpoint of fitting the competitors for the\r\nproblems of after-life, is that the object saved on such occasions is a\r\nleather dummy, and of all things in this world a leather dummy is\r\nperhaps the most placid and phlegmatic. It differs in many respects\r\nfrom an emotional Swedish gentleman, six foot high and constructed\r\nthroughout of steel and india rubber, who is being lugged away from\r\ncash which he has been regarding in the light of a legacy. Indeed, it\r\nwould not be hard to find a respect in which it does not differ. So far\r\nfrom lying inert in Sam's arms and allowing himself to be saved in a\r\nquiet and orderly manner, Mr. Swenson betrayed all the symptoms of one\r\nwho feels that he has fallen among murderers. Mr. Swenson, much as he\r\ndisliked competition, was ready to put up with it, provided that it was\r\nfair competition. This pulling your rival away from the loot so that\r\nyou could grab it yourself--thus shockingly had the man misinterpreted\r\nSam's motives--was another thing altogether and his stout soul would\r\nhave none of it. He began immediately to struggle with all the violence\r\nat his disposal. His large, hairy hands came out of the water and swung\r\nhopefully in the direction where he assumed his assailant's face to be.\r\n\r\nSam was not unprepared for this display. His researches in the art of\r\nlife-saving had taught him that your drowning man frequently struggled\r\nagainst his best interests. In which case, cruel to be kind, one simply\r\nstunned the blighter. He decided to stun Mr. Swenson, though, if he had\r\nknown that gentleman more intimately and had been aware that he had the\r\nreputation of possessing the thickest head on the water-front he would\r\nhave realised the magnitude of the task. Friends of Mr. Swenson, in\r\nconvivial moments, had frequently endeavoured to stun him with bottles,\r\nboots, and bits of lead piping, and had gone away depressed by failure.\r\nSam, ignorant of this, attempted to do the job with clenched fist,\r\nwhich he brought down as smartly as possible on the crown of the\r\nother's Derby hat.\r\n\r\nIt was the worst thing he could have done. Mr. Swenson thought highly\r\nof his hat and this brutal attack upon it confirmed his gloomiest\r\napprehensions. Now thoroughly convinced that the only thing to do was\r\nto sell his life dearly he wrenched himself round, seized his assailant\r\nby the neck, twined his arms about his middle, and accompanied him\r\nbelow the surface.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had swallowed his first pint and was beginning his\r\nsecond, Sam was reluctantly compelled to come to the conclusion that\r\nthis was the end. The thought irritated him unspeakably. This, he felt,\r\nwas just the silly, contrary way things always happened. Why should it\r\nbe he who was perishing like this? Why not Eustace Hignett? Now there was\r\na fellow whom this sort of thing would just have suited. Broken-hearted\r\nEustace Hignett would have looked on all this as a merciful release.\r\n\r\nHe paused in his reflections to try to disentangle the more prominent\r\nof Mr. Swenson's limbs from about him. By this time he was sure that he\r\nhad never met anyone he disliked so intensely as Mr. Swenson--not even\r\nhis Aunt Adeline. The man was a human octopus. Sam could count seven\r\ndistinct legs twined round him and at least as many arms. It seemed to\r\nhim that he was being done to death in his prime by a solid platoon of\r\nSwedes. He put his whole soul into one last effort ... something seemed\r\nto give ... he was free. Pausing only to try to kick Mr. Swenson in the\r\nface Sam shot to the surface. Something hard and sharp prodded him in\r\nthe head. Then something caught the collar of his coat; and, finally,\r\nspouting like a whale, he found himself dragged upwards and over the\r\nside of a boat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe time which Sam had spent with Mr. Swenson below the surface had\r\nbeen brief, but it had been long enough to enable the whole floating\r\npopulation of the North River to converge on the scene in scows,\r\nskiffs, launches, tugs and other vessels. The fact that the water in\r\nthat vicinity was crested with currency had not escaped the notice of\r\nthese navigators and they had gone to it as one man. First in the race\r\ncame the tug _Reuben S. Watson_, the skipper of which, following a\r\nfamous precedent, had taken his little daughter to bear him company. It\r\nwas to this fact that Marlowe really owed his rescue. Women have often\r\na vein of sentiment in them where men can only see the hard business\r\nside of a situation; and it was the skipper's daughter who insisted\r\nthat the family boat-hook, then in use as a harpoon for spearing dollar\r\nbills, should be devoted to the less profitable but humaner end of\r\nextricating the young man from a watery grave.\r\n\r\nThe skipper had grumbled a bit at first, but had given way--he always\r\nspoiled the girl--with the result that Sam found himself sitting on the\r\ndeck of the tug engaged in the complicated process of restoring his\r\nfaculties to the normal. In a sort of dream he perceived Mr. Swenson\r\nrise to the surface some feet away, adjust his Derby hat, and, after\r\none long look of dislike in his direction, swim off rapidly to intercept\r\na five which was floating under the stern of a near-by skiff.\r\n\r\nSam sat on the deck and panted. He played on the boards like a public\r\nfountain. At the back of his mind there was a flickering thought that\r\nhe wanted to do something, a vague feeling that he had some sort of an\r\nappointment which he must keep; but he was unable to think what it was.\r\nMeanwhile, he conducted tentative experiments with his breath. It was\r\nso long since he had last breathed that he had lost the knack of it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, aincher wet?\" said a voice.\r\n\r\nThe skipper's daughter was standing beside him, looking down\r\ncommiseratingly. Of the rest of the family all he could see was the\r\nbroad blue seats of their trousers as they leaned hopefully over the\r\nside in the quest for wealth.\r\n\r\n\"Yessir! You sure are wet! Gee! I never seen anyone so wet! I seen wet\r\nguys, but I never seen anyone so wet as you. Yessir, you're certainly\r\n_wet_!\"\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ wet,\" admitted Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Yessir, you're wet! Wet's the word all right. Good and wet, that's\r\nwhat you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the water,\" said Sam. His brain was still clouded; he wished he\r\ncould remember what that appointment was. \"That's what has made me\r\nwet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's sure made you wet all right,\" agreed the girl. She looked at him\r\ninterestedly. \"Wotcha do it for?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Do it for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, wotcha do it for? How come? Wotcha do a Brodie for off'n that\r\nship? I didn't see it myself, but pa says you come walloping down off'n\r\nthe deck like a sack of potatoes.\"\r\n\r\nSam uttered a sharp cry. He had remembered.\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's who?\"\r\n\r\n\"The liner.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's off down the river, I guess. She was swinging round, the last I\r\nseen of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's not gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure she's gone. Wotcha expect her to do? She's gotta to get over to\r\nthe other side, ain't she? Cert'nly she's gone.\" She looked at him\r\ninterested. \"Do you want to be on board her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, for the love of Pete, wotcha doin' walloping off'n her like a\r\nsack of potatoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I slipped. I was pushed or something.\" Sam sprang to his feet and\r\nlooked wildly about him. \"I must get back. Isn't there any way of\r\ngetting back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you could catch up with her at quarantine out in the bay. She'll\r\nstop to let the pilot off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you take me to quarantine?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced doubtfully at the seat of the nearest pair of\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we _could_,\" she said. \"But pa's kind of set in his ways,\r\nand right now he's fishing for dollar bills with the boat-hook. He's\r\napt to get sorta mad if he's interrupted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give him fifty dollars if he'll put me on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got it on you?\" inquired the nymph coyly. She had her share of\r\nsentiment, but she was her father's daughter and inherited from him the\r\nbusiness sense.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is.\" He pulled out his pocket-book. The book was dripping, but\r\nthe contents were only fairly moist.\r\n\r\n\"Pa!\" said the girl.\r\n\r\nThe trouser-seat remained where it was--deaf to its child's cry.\r\n\r\n\"Pa! Commere! Wantcha!\"\r\n\r\nThe trousers did not even quiver. But this girl was a girl of decision.\r\nThere was some nautical implement resting in a rack convenient to her\r\nhand. It was long, solid, and constructed of one of the harder forms of\r\nwood. Deftly extracting this from its place she smote her inoffensive\r\nparent on the only visible portion of him. He turned sharply,\r\nexhibiting a red, bearded face.\r\n\r\n\"Pa, this gen'man wants to be took aboard the boat at quarantine. He'll\r\ngive you fifty berries.\"\r\n\r\nThe wrath died out of the skipper's face like the slow turning down of\r\na lamp. The fishing had been poor, and so far he had only managed to\r\nsecure a single two-dollar bill. In a crisis like the one which had so\r\nsuddenly arisen you cannot do yourself justice with a boat-hook.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty berries!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty seeds!\" the girl assured him. \"Are you on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Queen,\" said the skipper simply, \"you said a mouthful!\"\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later Sam was climbing up the side of the liner as it\r\nlay towering over the tug like a mountain. His clothes hung about him\r\nclammily. He squelched as he walked.\r\n\r\nA kindly looking old gentleman who was smoking a cigar by the rail\r\nregarded him with open eyes.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, you're very wet,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSam passed him with a cold face and hurried through the door leading to\r\nthe companion-way.\r\n\r\n\"Mummie, why is that man wet?\" cried the clear voice of a little child.\r\n\r\nSam whizzed by, leaping down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, sir! You're very wet!\" said a steward in the doorway of the\r\ndining-saloon.\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ wet,\" said a stewardess in the passage.\r\n\r\nSam raced for his state-room. He bolted in and sank on the lounge. In\r\nthe lower berth Eustace Hignett was lying with closed eyes. He opened\r\nthem languidly--then stared.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" he said. \"I say! You're wet.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSam removed his clinging garments and hurried into a new suit. He was\r\nin no mood for conversation, and Eustace Hignett's frank curiosity\r\njarred upon him. Happily, at this point, a sudden shivering of the\r\nfloor and a creaking of woodwork proclaimed the fact that the vessel\r\nwas under way again, and his cousin, turning pea-green, rolled over on\r\nhis side with a hollow moan. Sam finished buttoning his waistcoat and\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\nHe was passing the Enquiry Bureau on the C-Deck, striding along with\r\nbent head and scowling brow, when a sudden exclamation caused him to\r\nlook up, and the scowl was wiped from his brow as with a sponge. For\r\nthere stood the girl he had met on the dock. With her was a superfluous\r\nyoung man who looked like a parrot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _how_ are you?\" asked the girl breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Splendid, thanks,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you get very wet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did get a little damp.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would,\" said the young man who looked like a parrot.\r\n\"Directly I saw you go over the side I said to myself: 'That fellow's\r\ngoing to get wet!'\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said the girl, \"may I--Mr.--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marlowe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Marlowe. Mr. Bream Mortimer.\"\r\n\r\nSam smirked at the young man. The young man smirked at Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly got left behind,\" said Bream Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, nearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"No joke getting left behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have to take the next boat. Lose a lot of time,\" said Mr. Mortimer,\r\ndriving home his point.\r\n\r\nThe girl had listened to these intellectual exchanges with impatience.\r\nShe now spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bream!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do be a dear and run down to the saloon and see if it's all right\r\nabout our places for lunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all right. The table steward said so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but go and make certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\nHe hopped away and the girl turned to Sam with shining eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Marlowe, you oughtn't to have done it! Really, you oughtn't!\r\nYou might have been drowned! But I never saw anything so wonderful. It\r\nwas like the stories of knights who used to jump into lions' dens after\r\ngloves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Sam, a little vaguely. The resemblance had not struck him.\r\nIt seemed a silly hobby and rough on the lions, too.\r\n\r\n\"It was the sort of thing Sir Lancelot or Sir Galahad would have done!\r\nBut you shouldn't have bothered, really! It's all right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's all right now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'd quite forgotten that Mr. Mortimer was to be on board. He has\r\ngiven me all the money I shall need. You see it was this way. I had to\r\nsail on this boat in rather a hurry. Father's head clerk was to have\r\ngone to the bank and got some money and met me on board and given\r\nit to me, but the silly old man was late, and when he got to the dock\r\nthey had just pulled in the gang-plank. So he tried to throw the money to\r\nme in a handkerchief and it fell into the water. But you shouldn't have\r\ndived in after it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well!\" said Sam, straightening his tie, with a quiet brave smile.\r\nHe had never expected to feel grateful to that obese bounder who had\r\nshoved him off the rail, but now he would have liked to seek him out\r\nand offer him his bank-roll.\r\n\r\n\"You really are the bravest man I ever met!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"How modest you are! But I suppose all brave men are modest!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was only too delighted at what looked like a chance of doing you a\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the extraordinary quickness of it that was so wonderful. I do\r\nadmire presence of mind. You didn't hesitate for a second. You just\r\nshot over the side as though propelled by some irresistible force!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was nothing, nothing really. One just happens to have the knack of\r\nkeeping one's head and acting quickly on the spur of the moment. Some\r\npeople have it, some haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"And just think! As Bream was saying....\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ all right,\" said Mr. Mortimer, re-appearing suddenly. \"I\r\nsaw a couple of stewards and they both said it was all right. So it's\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid,\" said the girl. \"Oh, Bream!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do be an angel and run along to my stateroom and see if Pinky-Boodles\r\nis quite comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bound to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But do go. He may be feeling lonely. Chirrup to him a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chirrup?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to cheer him up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Run along!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mortimer ran along. He had the air of one who feels that he only\r\nneeds a peaked cap and a uniform two sizes too small for him to be a\r\nproperly equipped messenger boy.\r\n\r\n\"And, as Bream was saying,\" resumed the girl, \"you might have been left\r\nbehind.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Sam, edging a step closer, \"was the thought that tortured\r\nme, the thought that a friendship so delightfully begun....\"\r\n\r\n\"But it hadn't begun. We have never spoken to each other before now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you forgotten? On the dock....\"\r\n\r\nSudden enlightenment came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are the man poor Pinky-Boodles bit!\"\r\n\r\n\"The lucky man!\"\r\n\r\nHer face clouded.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Pinky is feeling the motion of the boat a little. It's his first\r\nvoyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall always remember that it was Pinky who first brought us\r\ntogether. Would you care for a stroll on deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not just now, thanks. I must be getting back to my room to finish\r\nunpacking. After lunch, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be there. By the way, you know my name, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mine?\" She smiled brightly. \"It's funny that a person's name is the\r\nlast thing one thinks of asking. Mine is Bennett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bennett!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelmina Bennett. My friends,\" she said softly as she turned away,\r\n\"call me Billie!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some moments Sam remained where he was staring after the girl as\r\nshe flitted down the passage. He felt dizzy. Mental acrobatics always\r\nhave an unsettling effect, and a young man may be excused for feeling a\r\nlittle dizzy when he is called upon suddenly and without any warning to\r\nreadjust all his preconceived views on any subject. Listening to\r\nEustace Hignett's story of his blighted romance, Sam had formed an\r\nunflattering opinion of this Wilhelmina Bennett who had broken off her\r\nengagement simply because on the day of the marriage his cousin had\r\nbeen short of the necessary wedding garment. He had, indeed, thought a\r\nlittle smugly how different his goddess of the red hair was from the\r\nobject of Eustace Hignett's affections. And how they had proved to be\r\none and the same. It was disturbing. It was like suddenly finding the\r\nvampire of a five-reel feature film turn into the heroine.\r\n\r\nSome men, on making the discovery of this girl's identity, might have\r\nfelt that Providence had intervened to save them from a disastrous\r\nentanglement. This point of view never occurred to Samuel Marlowe. The\r\nway he looked at it was that he had been all wrong about Wilhelmina\r\nBennett. Eustace, he felt, had been to blame throughout. If this girl had\r\nmaltreated Eustace's finer feelings, then her reason for doing so must\r\nhave been excellent and praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nAfter all ... poor old Eustace ... quite a good fellow, no doubt in many\r\nways ... but, coming down to brass tacks, what was there about Eustace\r\nthat gave him any license to monopolise the affections of a wonderful\r\ngirl? Where, in a word, did Eustace Hignett get off? He made a\r\ntremendous grievance of the fact that she had broken off the\r\nengagement, but what right had he to go about the place expecting her\r\nto be engaged to him? Eustace Hignett, no doubt, looked upon the poor\r\ngirl as utterly heartless. Marlowe regarded her behaviour as thoroughly\r\nsensible. She had made a mistake, and, realising this at the eleventh\r\nhour, she had had the force of character to correct it. He was sorry\r\nfor poor old Eustace, but he really could not permit the suggestion\r\nthat Wilhelmina Bennett--her friends called her Billie--had not behaved\r\nin a perfectly splendid way throughout. It was women like Wilhelmina\r\nBennett--Billie to her intimates--who made the world worth living in.\r\n\r\nHer friends called her Billie. He did not blame them. It was a\r\ndelightful name and suited her to perfection. He practised it a few\r\ntimes. \"Billie ... Billie ... Billie....\" It certainly ran pleasantly off\r\nthe tongue. \"Billie Bennett.\" Very musical. \"Billie Marlowe.\" Still\r\nbetter. \"We noticed among those present the charming and popular Mrs.\r\n'Billie' Marlowe.\"\r\n\r\nA consuming desire came over him to talk about the girl to someone.\r\nObviously indicated as the party of the second part was Eustace\r\nHignett. If Eustace was still capable of speech--and after all the boat\r\nwas hardly rolling at all--he would enjoy a further chat about his\r\nruined life. Besides, he had another reason for seeking Eustace's\r\nsociety. As a man who had been actually engaged to marry this supreme\r\ngirl, Eustace Hignett had an attraction for Sam akin to that of some\r\ngreat public monument. He had become a sort of shrine. He had taken on\r\na glamour. Sam entered the state-room almost reverentially with\r\nsomething of the emotions of a boy going into his first dime museum.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit was lying on his back staring at the roof of the berth. By\r\nlying absolutely still and forcing himself to think of purely inland\r\nscenes and objects he had contrived to reduce the green in his\r\ncomplexion to a mere tinge. But it would be paltering with the truth to\r\nsay that he felt _debonair_. He received Sam with a wan austerity.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down!\" he said. \"Don't stand there swaying like that. I can't bear\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we aren't out of the harbour yet. Surely you aren't going to be\r\nsea-sick already.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can issue no positive guarantee. Perhaps if I can keep my mind off\r\nit ... I have had good results for the last ten minutes by thinking\r\nsteadily of the Sahara. There,\" said Eustace Hignett with enthusiasm,\r\n\"is a place for you! That is something like a spot! Miles and miles of\r\nsand and not a drop of water anywhere!\"\r\n\r\nSam sat down on the lounge.\r\n\r\n\"You're quite right. The great thing is to concentrate your mind on\r\nother topics. Why not, for instance, tell me some more about your\r\nunfortunate affair with that girl--Billie Bennett I think you said her\r\nname was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelmina Bennett. Where on earth did you get the idea that her name\r\nwas Billie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a notion that girls called Wilhelmina were sometimes Billie to\r\ntheir friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never call her anything but Wilhelmina. But I really cannot talk\r\nabout it. The recollection tortures me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what you want. It's the counter-irritation principle.\r\nPersevere and you'll soon forget that you're on board ship at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's something in that,\" admitted Eustace reflectively. \"It's very\r\ngood of you to be so sympathetic and interested.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow ... anything that I can do ... where did you meet her\r\nfirst, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"At a dinner....\" Eustace Hignett broke off abruptly. He had a good\r\nmemory and he had just recollected the fish they had served at that\r\ndinner--a flabby and exhausted looking fish, half sunk beneath the\r\nsurface of a thick white sauce.\r\n\r\n\"And what struck you most forcibly about her at first? Her lovely hair,\r\nI suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know she had lovely hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear chap, I naturally assumed that any girl with whom you fell in\r\nlove would have nice hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are perfectly right, as it happens. Her hair was remarkably\r\nbeautiful. It was red....\"\r\n\r\n\"Like autumn leaves with the sun on them!\" said Marlowe ecstatically.\r\n\r\n\"What an extraordinary thing! That is an absolutely exact description.\r\nHer eyes were a deep blue....\"\r\n\r\n\"Or, rather, green.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Green. There is a shade of green that looks blue.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil do you know about the colour of her eyes?\" demanded\r\nEustace heatedly. \"Am I telling you about her, or are you telling me?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear old man, don't get excited. Don't you see I am trying to\r\nconstruct this girl in my imagination, to visualise her? I don't\r\npretend to doubt your special knowledge, but after all green eyes\r\ngenerally do go with red hair and there are all shades of green. There\r\nis the bright green of meadow grass, the dull green of the uncut\r\nemerald, the faint yellowish green of your face at the present\r\nmoment....\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk about the colour of my face! Now you've gone and reminded\r\nme just when I was beginning to forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awfully sorry! Stupid of me! Get your mind off it again--quick! What\r\nwere you saying? Oh, yes, this girl. I always think it helps one to\r\nform a mental picture of people if one knows something about their\r\ntastes--what sort of things they are interested in, their favourite\r\ntopics of conversation, and so on. This Miss Bennett now, what did she\r\nlike talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all sorts of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, for one thing she was very fond of poetry. It was that which\r\nfirst drew us together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poetry!\" Sam's heart sank a little. He had read a certain amount of\r\npoetry at school, and once he had won a prize of three shillings and\r\nsixpence for the last line of a limerick in a competition in a weekly\r\npaper, but he was self-critic enough to know that poetry was not his\r\nlong suit. Still there was a library on board ship and no doubt it\r\nwould be possible to borrow the works of some standard poet and bone\r\nthem up from time to time.\r\n\r\n\"Any special poet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she seemed to like my stuff. You never read my sonnet-sequence\r\non Spring, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. What other poets did she like besides you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tennyson principally,\" said Eustace Hignett with a reminiscent quiver\r\nin his voice. \"The hours we have spent together reading the Idylls of\r\nthe King!\"\r\n\r\n\"The which of what?\" enquired Sam, taking a pencil from his pocket and\r\nshooting out a cuff.\r\n\r\n\"The Idylls of the King. My good man, I know you have a soul which\r\nwould be considered inadequate by a common earthworm, but you have\r\nsurely heard of Tennyson's Idylls of the King?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _those_! Why, my dear old chap; Tennyson's Idylls of the\r\nKing! Well, I should say! Have I heard of Tennyson's Idylls of the\r\nKing? Well, really! I suppose you haven't a copy with you on board by\r\nany chance?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a copy in my kit-bag. The very one we used to read together.\r\nTake it and keep it or throw it overboard. I don't want to see it\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nSam prospected among the shirts, collars and trousers in the bag and\r\npresently came upon a morocco-bound volume. He laid it beside him\r\non the lounge.\r\n\r\n\"Little by little, bit by bit,\" he said, \"I am beginning to form a sort\r\nof picture of this girl, this--what was her name again? Bennett--this\r\nMiss Bennett. You have a wonderful knack of description. You make her\r\nseem so real and vivid. Tell me some more about her. She wasn't keen on\r\ngolf, by any chance, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe she did play. The subject came up once and she seemed rather\r\nenthusiastic. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'd much sooner talk to a girl about golf than poetry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are hardly likely to be in a position to have to talk to\r\nWilhelmina Bennett about either, I should imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there's that, of course. I was thinking of girls in general. Some\r\ngirls bar golf, and then it's rather difficult to know how to start\r\nconversation. But, tell me, were there any topics which got on Miss\r\nBennett's nerves, if you know what I mean? It seems to me that at one\r\ntime or another you may have said something that offended her. I mean,\r\nit seems curious that she should  have broken off the engagement if\r\nyou had never disagreed or quarrelled about anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, there was always the matter of that dog of hers. She\r\nhad a dog, you know, a snappy brute of a Pekingese. If there was ever\r\nany shadow of disagreement between us, it had to do with that dog. I\r\nmade rather a point of it that I would not have it about the home after\r\nwe were married.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see!\" said Sam. He shot his cuff once more and wrote on it:\r\n\"Dog-conciliate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course, that must have wounded her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not half so much as he wounded me! He pinned me by the ankle the day\r\nbefore we--Wilhelmina and I, I mean--were to have been married. It is\r\nsome satisfaction to me in my broken state to remember that I got home\r\non the little beast with considerable juiciness and lifted him clean\r\nover the Chesterfield.\"\r\n\r\nSam shook his head reprovingly.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't have done that!\" he said. He extended his cuff and added\r\nthe words \"Vitally important\" to what he had just written. \"It was\r\nprobably that which decided her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hate dogs,\" said Eustace Hignett querulously. \"I remember\r\nWilhelmina once getting quite annoyed with me because I refused to step\r\nin and separate a couple of the brutes, absolute strangers to me, who\r\nwere fighting in the street. I reminded her that we were all fighters\r\nnow-a-days, that life itself was in a sense a fight: but she wouldn't\r\nbe reasonable about it. She said that Sir Galahad would have done it\r\nlike a shot. I thought not. We have no evidence whatsoever that Sir\r\nGalahad was ever called upon to do anything half as dangerous. And,\r\nanyway, he wore armour. Give me a suit of mail reaching well down over\r\nthe ankles, and I will willingly intervene in a hundred dog fights. But\r\nin thin flannel trousers no!\"\r\n\r\nSam rose. His heart was light. He had never, of course, supposed that\r\nthe girl was anything but perfect; but it was nice to find his high\r\nopinion of her corroborated by one who had no reason to exhibit her in\r\na favourable light. He understood her point of view and sympathised\r\nwith it. An idealist, how could she trust herself to Eustace Hignett?\r\nHow could she be content with a craven who, instead of scouring the\r\nworld in the quest for deeds of daring do, had fallen down so\r\nlamentably on his first assignment? There was a specious attractiveness\r\nabout poor old Eustace which might conceivably win a girl's heart for a\r\ntime; he wrote poetry, talked well, and had a nice singing voice; but,\r\nas a partner for life ... well, he simply wouldn't do. That was all there\r\nwas to it. He simply didn't add up right. The man a girl like Wilhelmina\r\nBennett required for a husband was somebody entirely different ...\r\nsomebody, felt Samuel Marlowe, much more like Samuel Marlowe.\r\n\r\nSwelled almost to bursting-point with these reflections, he went on\r\ndeck to join the ante-luncheon promenade. He saw Billie almost at once.\r\nShe had put on one of these nice sacky sport-coats which so enhance\r\nfeminine charms, and was striding along the deck with the breeze\r\nplaying in her vivid hair like the female equivalent of a Viking.\r\nBeside her walked young Mr. Bream Mortimer.\r\n\r\nSam had been feeling a good deal of a fellow already, but at the sight\r\nof her welcoming smile his self-esteem almost caused him to explode.\r\nWhat magic there is in a girl's smile! It is the raisin which, dropped\r\nin the yeast of male complacency, induces fermentation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there you are, Mr. Marlowe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _there_ you are,\" said Bream Mortimer, with a slightly\r\ndifferent inflection.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I'd like a breath of fresh air before lunch,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bream!\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do be a darling and take this great heavy coat of mine down to my\r\nstate-room will you? I had no idea it was so warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll carry it,\" said Bream.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. I wouldn't dream of burdening you with it. Trot along and\r\nput it on the berth. It doesn't matter about folding it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Bream moodily.\r\n\r\nHe trotted along. There are moments when a man feels that all he needs\r\nin order to be a delivery wagon is a horse and a driver.\r\n\r\n\"He had better chirrup to the dog while he's there, don't you think?\"\r\nsuggested Sam. He felt that a resolute man with legs as long as Bream's\r\nmight well deposit a cloak on a berth and be back under the half-minute.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! Bream!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"While you're down there just chirrup a little more to poor Pinky. He\r\ndoes appreciate it so!\"\r\n\r\nBream disappeared. It is not always easy to interpret emotion from a\r\nglance at a man's back; but Bream's back looked like that of a man to\r\nwhom the thought has occurred that, given a couple of fiddles and a\r\npiano, he would have made a good hired orchestra.\r\n\r\n\"How is your dear little dog, by the way?\" enquired Sam solicitously,\r\nas he fell into step by her side.\r\n\r\n\"Much better now, thanks. I've made friends with a girl on board--did\r\nyou ever hear her name--Jane Hubbard--she's a rather well-known big-game\r\nhunter and she fixed up some sort of a mixture for Pinky which did\r\nhim a world of good. I don't know what was in it except Worcester\r\nSauce, but she said she always gave it to her mules in Africa when they\r\nhad the botts ... it's very nice of you to speak so affectionately of\r\npoor Pinky when he bit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Animal spirits!\" said Sam tolerantly. \"Pure animal spirits! I like to\r\nsee them. But, of course, I love all dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you? So do I!\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wish they didn't fight so much. I'm always stopping dog\r\nfights.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do admire a man who knows what to do at a dog fight. I'm afraid I'm\r\nrather helpless myself. There never seems anything to catch hold of.\"\r\nShe looked down. \"Have you been reading? What is the book?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a volume of Tennyson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you fond of Tennyson?\"\r\n\r\n\"I worship him,\" said Sam reverently. \"Those--\" he glanced at his\r\ncuff--\"those Idylls of the King! I do not like to think what an ocean\r\nvoyage would be if I had not my Tennyson with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must read him together. He is my favourite poet!\"\r\n\r\n\"We will! There is something about Tennyson....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, isn't there! I've felt that myself so often!\"\r\n\r\n\"Some poets are whales at epics and all that sort of thing, while\r\nothers call it a day when they've written something that runs to a\r\ncouple of verses, but where Tennyson had the bulge was that his long\r\ngame was just as good as his short. He was great off the tee and a\r\nmarvel with his chip-shots.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds as though you played golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I am not reading Tennyson, you can generally find me out on the\r\nlinks. Do you play?\"\r\n\r\n\"I love it. How extraordinary that we should have so much in common.\r\nWe really ought to be great friends.\"\r\n\r\nHe was pausing to select the best of three replies when the lunch bugle\r\nsounded.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" she cried. \"I must rush. But we shall see one another again\r\nup here afterwards?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"We'll sit and read Tennyson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine! Er--you and I and Mortimer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Bream is going to sit down below and look after poor Pinky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he--does he know he is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Billie. \"I'm going to tell him at lunch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the fourth morning of the voyage. Of course, when this story is\r\ndone in the movies they won't be satisfied with a bald statement like\r\nthat; they will have a Spoken Title or a Cut-Back Sub-Caption or\r\nwhatever they call the thing in the low dens where motion-picture\r\nscenario-lizards do their dark work, which will run:--\r\n\r\n    AND SO, CALM AND GOLDEN, THE DAYS WENT\r\n    BY, EACH FRAUGHT WITH HOPE AND YOUTH\r\n    AND SWEETNESS, LINKING TWO YOUNG\r\n    HEARTS IN SILKEN FETTERS FORGED BY THE\r\n    LAUGHING LOVE-GOD.\r\n\r\nand the males in the audience will shift their chewing gum to the other\r\ncheek and take a firmer grip of their companions' hands and the man at\r\nthe piano will play \"Everybody wants a key to my cellar\" or something\r\nequally appropriate, very soulfully and slowly, with a wistful eye on\r\nthe half-smoked cigarette which he has parked on the lowest octave and\r\nintends finishing as soon as the picture is over. But I prefer the\r\nplain frank statement that it was the fourth day of the voyage. That is\r\nmy story and I mean to stick to it.\r\n\r\nSamuel Marlowe, muffled in a bathrobe, came back to the stateroom from\r\nhis tub. His manner had the offensive jauntiness of the man who has had\r\na cold bath when he might just as easily have had a hot one. He looked\r\nout of the porthole at the shimmering sea. He felt strong and happy and\r\nexuberant.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely the spiritual pride induced by a cold bath that was\r\nuplifting this young man. The fact was that, as he towelled his glowing\r\nback, he had suddenly come to the decision that this very day he would\r\npropose to Wilhelmina Bennett. Yes, he would put his fortune to the\r\ntest, to win or lose it all. True, he had only known her for four days,\r\nbut what of that?\r\n\r\nNothing in the way of modern progress is more remarkable than the\r\nmanner in which the attitude of your lover has changed concerning\r\nproposals of marriage. When Samuel Marlowe's grandfather had convinced\r\nhimself, after about a year and a half of respectful aloofness, that the\r\nemotion which he felt towards Samuel Marlowe's grandmother-to-be was\r\nlove, the fashion of the period compelled him to approach the matter in a\r\nroundabout way. First, he spent an evening or two singing sentimental\r\nballads, she accompanying him on the piano and the rest of the family\r\nsitting on the side-lines to see that no rough stuff was pulled. Having\r\nnoted that she drooped her eyelashes and turned faintly pink when he came\r\nto the \"Thee--only thee!\" bit, he felt a mild sense of encouragement,\r\nstrong enough to justify him in taking her sister aside next day and\r\nasking if the object of his affections ever happened to mention his name\r\nin the course of conversation. Further _pour-parlers_ having passed\r\nwith her aunt, two more sisters, and her little brother, he felt that the\r\nmoment had arrived when he might send her a volume of Shelley, with\r\nsome of the passages marked in pencil. A few weeks later, he\r\ninterviewed her father and obtained his consent to the paying of his\r\naddresses. And finally, after writing her a letter which began \"Madam!\r\nyou will not have been insensible to the fact that for some time past\r\nyou have inspired in my bosom feelings deeper than those of ordinary\r\nfriendship....\" he waylaid her in the rose-garden and brought the thing\r\noff.\r\n\r\nHow different is the behaviour of the modern young man. His courtship\r\ncan hardly be called a courtship at all. His methods are those of Sir\r\nW. S. Gilbert's Alphonso.\r\n\r\n    \"Alphonso, who for cool assurance all creation licks,\r\n    He up and said to Emily who has cheek enough for six:\r\n    'Miss Emily, I love you. Will you marry? Say the word!'\r\n    And Emily said: 'Certainly, Alphonso, like a bird!'\"\r\n\r\nSam Marlowe was a warm supporter of the Alphonso method. He was a\r\nbright young man and did not require a year to make up his mind that\r\nWilhelmina Bennett had been set apart by Fate from the beginning of\r\ntime to be his bride. He had known it from the moment he saw her on the\r\ndock, and all the subsequent strolling, reading, talking, soup-drinking,\r\ntea-drinking, and shuffle-board-playing which they had done together\r\nhad merely solidified his original impression. He loved this girl with\r\nall the force of a fiery nature--the fiery nature of the Marlowes was a\r\nbyword in Bruton Street, Berkeley Square--and something seemed to\r\nwhisper that she loved him. At any rate she wanted somebody like Sir\r\nGalahad, and, without wishing to hurl bouquets at himself, he could not\r\nsee where she could possibly get anyone liker Sir Galahad than himself.\r\nSo, wind and weather permitting, Samuel Marlowe intended to propose to\r\nWilhelmina Bennett this very day.\r\n\r\nHe let down the trick basin which hung beneath the mirror and,\r\ncollecting his shaving materials, began to lather his face.\r\n\r\n\"I am the Bandolero!\" sang Sam blithely through the soap, \"I am, I am\r\nthe Bandolero! Yes, yes, I am the Bandolero!\"\r\n\r\nThe untidy heap of bedclothes in the lower berth stirred restlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God!\" said Eustace Hignett thrusting out a tousled head.\r\n\r\nSam regarded his cousin with commiseration. Horrid things had been\r\nhappening to Eustace during the last few days, and it was quite a\r\npleasant surprise each morning to find that he was still alive.\r\n\r\n\"Feeling bad again, old man?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was feeling all right,\" replied Hignett churlishly, \"until you began\r\nthe farmyard imitations. What sort of a day is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Glorious! The sea....\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk about the sea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry! The sun is shining brighter than it has ever shone in the\r\nhistory of the race. Why don't you get up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will induce me to get up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go a regular buster and have an egg for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I am an ostrich?\" He eyed Sam sourly. \"You seem devilish\r\npleased with yourself this morning!\"\r\n\r\nSam dried the razor carefully and put it away. He hesitated. Then the\r\ndesire to confide in somebody got the better of him.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" he said apologetically, \"I'm in love!\"\r\n\r\n\"In love!\" Eustace Hignett sat up and bumped his head sharply against\r\nthe berth above him. \"Has this been going on long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ever since the voyage started.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you might have told me,\" said Eustace reproachfully. \"I told\r\nyou my troubles. Why did you not let me know that this awful thing had\r\ncome upon you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, old man, during these last few days I had a\r\nnotion that your mind was, so to speak, occupied elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a girl I met on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do it!\" said Eustace Hignett solemnly. \"As a friend I entreat\r\nyou not to do it! Take my advice, as a man who knows women, and don't\r\ndo it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Propose to her. I can tell by the glitter in your eye that you are\r\nintending to propose to this girl--probably this morning. Don't do it.\r\nWomen are the devil, whether they marry you or jilt you. Do you realise\r\nthat women wear black evening dresses that have to be hooked up in a\r\nhurry when you are late for the theatre, and that, out of sheer wanton\r\nmalignity, the hooks and eyes on those dresses are also made black? Do\r\nyou realise...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've thought it all out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And take the matter of children. How would you like to become the\r\nfather--and a mere glance around you will show you that the chances are\r\nenormously in favour of such a thing happening--of a boy with\r\nspectacles and protruding front teeth who asks questions all the time?\r\nOut of six small boys whom I saw when I came on board, four wore\r\nspectacles and had teeth like rabbits. The other two were equally\r\nrevolting in different styles. How would you like to become the\r\nfather...?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no need to be indelicate,\" said Sam stiffly. \"A man must take\r\nthese chances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give her the miss in baulk,\" pleaded Hignett. \"Stay down here for the\r\nrest of the voyage. You can easily dodge her when you get to\r\nSouthampton. And, if she sends messages, say you're ill and can't be\r\ndisturbed.\"\r\n\r\nSam gazed at him, revolted. More than ever he began to understand how\r\nit was that a girl with ideals had broken off her engagement with this\r\nman. He finished dressing, and, after a satisfying breakfast, went on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was, as he had said, a glorious morning. The sample which he had had\r\nthrough the porthole had not prepared him for the magic of it. The ship\r\nswam in a vast bowl of the purest blue on an azure carpet flecked with\r\nsilver. It was a morning which impelled a man to great deeds, a morning\r\nwhich shouted to him to chuck his chest out and be romantic. The sight\r\nof Billie Bennett, trim and gleaming in a pale green sweater and a\r\nwhite skirt had the effect of causing Marlowe to alter the programme\r\nwhich he had sketched out. Proposing to this girl was not a thing to be\r\nput off till after lunch. It was a thing to be done now and at once. The\r\nfinest efforts of the finest cooks in the world could not put him in\r\nbetter form than he felt at present.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Miss Bennett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Marlowe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it a perfect day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful!\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes all the difference on board ship if the weather is fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we walk round?\" said Billie.\r\n\r\nSam glanced about him. It was the time of day when the promenade deck\r\nwas always full. Passengers in cocoons of rugs lay on chairs, waiting\r\nin a dull trance till the steward should arrive with the eleven o'clock\r\nsoup. Others, more energetic, strode up and down. From the point of\r\nview of a man who wished to reveal his most sacred feelings to a\r\nbeautiful girl, the place was practically Fifth Avenue and Forty-second\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\"It's so crowded,\" he said. \"Let's go on to the upper deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. You can read to me. Go and fetch your Tennyson.\"\r\n\r\nSam felt that fortune was playing into his hands. His four-days'\r\nacquaintance with the bard had been sufficient to show him that the man\r\nwas there forty ways when it came to writing about love. You could open\r\nhis collected works almost anywhere and shut your eyes and dab down\r\nyour finger on some red-hot passage. A proposal of marriage is a thing\r\nwhich it is rather difficult to bring neatly into the ordinary run of\r\nconversation. It wants leading up to. But, if you once start reading\r\npoetry, especially Tennyson's, almost anything is apt to give you your\r\ncue. He bounded light-heartedly into the state-room, waking Eustace\r\nHignett from an uneasy dose.\r\n\r\n\"Now what?\" said Eustace.\r\n\r\n\"Where's that copy of Tennyson you gave me? I left it--ah, here it is.\r\nWell, see you later!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait! What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that girl I told you about,\" said Sam making for the door. \"She\r\nwants me to read Tennyson to her on the upper deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tennyson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the upper deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the end,\" said Eustace Hignett, turning his face to the wall.\r\n\r\nSam raced up the companion-way as far as it went; then, going out on\r\ndeck, climbed a flight of steps and found himself in the only part of\r\nthe ship which was ever even comparatively private. The main herd of\r\npassengers preferred the promenade deck, two layers below.\r\n\r\nHe threaded his way through a maze of boats, ropes, and curious-shaped\r\nsteel structures which the architect of the ship seemed to have tacked\r\non at the last moment in a spirit of sheer exuberance. Above him\r\ntowered one of the funnels, before him a long, slender mast. He hurried\r\non, and presently came upon Billie sitting on a garden seat, backed by\r\nthe white roof of the smoke-room; beside this was a small deck which\r\nseemed to have lost its way and strayed up here all by itself. It was\r\nthe deck on which one could occasionally see the patients playing an\r\nodd game with long sticks and bits of wood--not shuffleboard but\r\nsomething even lower in the mental scale. This morning, however, the\r\ndevotees of this pastime were apparently under proper restraint, for\r\nthe deck was empty.\r\n\r\n\"This is jolly,\" he said, sitting down beside the girl and drawing a\r\ndeep breath of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I love this deck. It's so peaceful.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the only part of the ship where you can be reasonably sure of not\r\nmeeting stout men in flannels and nautical caps. An ocean voyage always\r\nmakes me wish that I had a private yacht.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"A private yacht,\" repeated Sam sliding a trifle closer. \"We would sail\r\nabout, visiting desert islands which lay like jewels in the heart of\r\ntropic seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"We?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly we. It wouldn't be any fun if you were not there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very complimentary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it wouldn't. I'm not fond of girls as a rule....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Sam decidedly. It was a point which he wished to make clear\r\nat the outset. \"Not at all fond. My friends have often remarked upon\r\nit. A palmist once told me that I had one of those rare spiritual\r\nnatures which cannot be satisfied with substitutes but must seek and\r\nseek till they find their soul-mate. When other men all round me were\r\nfrittering away their emotions in idle flirtations which did not touch\r\ntheir deeper natures, I was ... I was ... well, I wasn't, if you see what I\r\nmean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you wasn't ... weren't--?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Some day I knew I should meet the only girl I could possibly love,\r\nand then I would pour out upon her the stored-up devotion of a\r\nlifetime, lay an unblemished heart at her feet, fold her in my arms and\r\nsay 'At last!'\"\r\n\r\n\"How jolly for her. Like having a circus all to oneself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes,\" said Sam after a momentary pause.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a child I always thought that that would be the most\r\nwonderful thing in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most wonderful thing in the world is love, a pure and consuming\r\nlove, a love which....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hello!\" said a voice.\r\n\r\nAll through this scene, right from the very beginning of it, Sam had\r\nnot been able to rid himself of a feeling that there was something\r\nmissing. The time and the place and the girl--they were all present and\r\ncorrect; nevertheless there was something missing, some familiar object\r\nwhich seemed to leave a gap. He now perceived that what had caused the\r\nfeeling was the complete absence of Bream Mortimer. He was absent no\r\nlonger. He was standing in front of them with one leg, his head lowered\r\nas if he were waiting for someone to scratch it. Sam's primary impulse\r\nwas to offer him a nut.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hello, Bream!\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" said Bream Mortimer. \"Here you are!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you might be here,\" said Bream.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here we are,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we're here,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause.\r\n\r\n\"Mind if I join you?\" said Bream.\r\n\r\n\"N-no,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"N-no,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Billie again. \"No ... that is to say ... oh no, not at all.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a third pause.\r\n\r\n\"On second thoughts,\" said Bream, \"I believe I'll take a stroll on the\r\npromenade deck, if you don't mind.\"\r\n\r\nThey said they did not mind. Bream Mortimer, having bumped his head\r\ntwice against overhanging steel ropes, melted away.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that fellow?\" demanded Sam wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\"He's the son of father's best friend.\"\r\n\r\nSam started. Somehow this girl had always been so individual to him that\r\nhe had never thought of her having a father.\r\n\r\n\"We have known each other all our lives,\" continued Billie. \"Father\r\nthinks a tremendous lot of Bream. I suppose it was because Bream was\r\nsailing by her that father insisted on my coming over on this boat. I'm\r\nin disgrace, you know. I was cabled for and had to sail at a few days'\r\nnotice. I....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hello!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bream!\" said Billie, looking at him as he stood on the old spot\r\nin the same familiar attitude with rather less affection than the son\r\nof her father's best friend might have expected. \"I thought you said\r\nyou were going down to the Promenade Deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did go down to the promenade deck. And I'd hardly got there when a\r\nfellow who's getting up the ship's concert to-morrow night nobbled me\r\nto do a couple of songs. He wanted to know if I knew anyone else who\r\nwould help. I came up to ask you,\" he said to Sam, \"if you would do\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Sam. \"I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's got a man who's going to lecture on deep-sea fish and a couple of\r\nwomen who both want to sing 'The Rosary' but he's still an act or two\r\nshort. Sure you won't rally round?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right.\" Bream Mortimer hovered wistfully above them. \"It's a\r\ngreat morning, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bream!\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do be a pet and go and talk to Jane Hubbard. I'm sure she must be\r\nfeeling lonely. I left her all by herself down on the next deck.\"\r\n\r\nA look of alarm spread itself over Bream's face.\r\n\r\n\"Jane Hubbard! Oh, say, have a heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"She's a very nice girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's so darned dynamic. She looks at you as if you were a giraffe or\r\nsomething and she would like to take a pot at you with a rifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Run along. Get her to tell you some of her big-game hunting\r\nexperiences. They are most interesting.\"\r\n\r\nBream drifted sadly away.\r\n\r\n\"I don't blame Miss Hubbard,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Looking at him as if she wanted to pot at him with a rifle. I should\r\nlike to do it myself. What were you saying when he came up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't let's talk about me. Read me some Tennyson.\"\r\n\r\nSam opened the book very willingly. Infernal Bream Mortimer had\r\nabsolutely shot to pieces the spell which had begun to fall on them at\r\nthe beginning of their conversation. Only by reading poetry, it seemed\r\nto him, could it be recovered. And when he saw the passage at which the\r\nvolume had opened he realised that his luck was in. Good old Tennyson!\r\nHe was all right. He had the stuff. You could send him to hit in a\r\npinch every time with the comfortable knowledge that he would not\r\nstrike out.\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n    \"'Oh let the solid ground\r\n      Not fail beneath my feet\r\n    Before my life has found\r\n      What some have found so sweet;\r\n    Then let come what come may,\r\n    What matter if I go mad,\r\n    I shall have had my day.\r\n\r\n    Let the sweet heavens endure,\r\n      Not close and darken above me\r\n    Before I am quite quite sure\r\n      That there is one to love me....'\"\r\n\r\nThis was absolutely topping. It was like diving off a spring-board. He\r\ncould see the girl sitting with a soft smile on her face, her eyes, big\r\nand dreamy, gazing out over the sunlit sea. He laid down the book and\r\ntook her hand.\r\n\r\n\"There is something,\" he began in a low voice, \"which I have been\r\ntrying to say ever since we met, something which I think you must have\r\nread in my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nHer head was bent. She did not withdraw her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Until this voyage began,\" he went on, \"I did not know what life meant.\r\nAnd then I saw you! It was like the gate of heaven opening. You're the\r\ndearest girl I ever met, and you can bet I'll never forget....\" He\r\nstopped. \"I'm not trying to make it rhyme,\" he said apologetically.\r\n\"Billie, don't think me silly ... I mean ... if you had the merest notion,\r\ndearest ... I don't know what's the matter with me ... Billie, darling, you\r\nare the only girl in the world! I have been looking for you for years\r\nand years and I have found you at last, my soul-mate. Surely this does\r\nnot come as a surprise to you? That is, I mean, you must have seen that\r\nI've been keen ... There's that damned Walt Mason stuff again!\" His eyes\r\nfell on the volume beside him and he uttered an exclamation of\r\nenlightenment. \"It's those poems!\" he cried. \"I've been boning them up\r\nto such an extent that they've got me doing it too. What I'm trying to\r\nsay is, Will you marry me?\"\r\n\r\nShe was drooping towards him. Her face was very sweet and tender, her\r\neyes misty. He slid an arm about her waist. She raised her lips to his.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly she drew herself away, a cloud on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" she said, \"I've a confession to make.\"\r\n\r\n\"A confession? You? Nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't get rid of a horrible thought. I was wondering if this will\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our love? Don't be afraid that it will fade ... I mean ... why, it's so\r\nvast, it's bound to last ... that is to say, of course, it will.\"\r\n\r\nShe traced a pattern on the deck with her shoe.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid of myself. You see, once before--and it was not so very\r\nlong ago,--I thought I had met my ideal, but....\"\r\n\r\nSam laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Are you worrying about that absurd business of poor old Eustace\r\nHignett?\"\r\n\r\nShe started violently.\r\n\r\n\"You know!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! He told me himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know him? Where did you meet him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've known him all my life. He's my cousin. As a matter of fact, we\r\nare sharing a stateroom on board now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eustace is on board! Oh, this is awful! What shall I do when I meet\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pass it off with a light laugh and a genial quip. Just say: 'Oh,\r\nhere you are!' or something. You know the sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be terrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it. Why should you feel embarrassed? He must have\r\nrealised by now that you acted in the only possible way. It was absurd\r\nhis ever expecting you to marry him. I mean to say, just look at it\r\ndispassionately ... Eustace  ... poor old Eustace ... and _you_! The\r\nPrincess and the Swineherd!\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Mr. Hignett keep pigs?\" she asked, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that poor old Eustace is so far below you, darling, that, with\r\nthe most charitable intentions, one can only look on his asking you to\r\nmarry him in the light of a record exhibition of pure nerve. A dear,\r\ngood fellow, of course, but hopeless where the sterner realities of\r\nlife are concerned. A man who can't even stop a dog-fight! In a world\r\nwhich is practically one seething mass of fighting dogs, how could you\r\ntrust yourself to such a one? Nobody is fonder of Eustace Hignett than\r\nI am, but ... well, I mean to say!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see what you mean. He really wasn't my ideal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by a mile.\"\r\n\r\nShe mused, her chin in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, he was quite a dear in a lot of ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a splendid chap,\" said Sam tolerantly.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard him sing? I think what first attracted me to him\r\nwas his beautiful voice. He really sings extraordinarily well.\"\r\n\r\nA slight but definite spasm of jealousy afflicted Sam. He had no\r\nobjection to praising poor old Eustace within decent limits, but the\r\nconversation seemed to him to be confining itself too exclusively to\r\none subject.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" he said. \"Oh yes, I've heard him sing. Not lately. He does\r\ndrawing-room ballads and all that sort of thing still, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard him sing 'My love is like a glowing tulip that in\r\nan old-world garden grows'?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not had that advantage,\" replied Sam stiffly. \"But anyone can\r\nsing a drawing-room ballad. Now something funny, something that will\r\nmake people laugh, something that really needs putting across ... that's\r\na different thing altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you sing that sort of thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"People have been good enough to say....\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Billie decidedly, \"you must certainly do something at the\r\nship's concert to-morrow! The idea of your trying to hide your light\r\nunder a bushel! I will tell Bream to count on you. He is an excellent\r\naccompanist. He can accompany you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but ... well, I don't know,\" said Sam doubtfully. He could not help\r\nremembering that the last time he had sung in public had been at a\r\nhouse-supper at school, seven years before, and that on that occasion\r\nsomebody whom it was a lasting grief to him that he had been unable to\r\nidentify had thrown a pat of butter at him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you must sing,\" said Billie. \"I'll tell Bream when I go down\r\nto lunch. What will you sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--er--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure it will be wonderful whatever it is. You are so\r\nwonderful in every way. You remind me of one of the heroes of old!\"\r\n\r\nSam's discomposure vanished. In the first place, this was much more the\r\nsort of conversation which he felt the situation indicated. In the\r\nsecond place he had remembered that there was no need for him to sing\r\nat all. He could do that imitation of Frank Tinney which had been such\r\na hit at the Trinity smoker. He was on safe ground there. He knew he\r\nwas good. He clasped the girl to him and kissed her sixteen times.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as he released her, the cloud came back into her face.\r\n\r\n\"My angel,\" he asked solicitously, \"what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of father,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe glowing splendour of the morning took on a touch of chill for Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" he said thoughtfully. \"Yes, I see what you mean! He will\r\nthink that we have been a little precipitate, eh? He will require a\r\nlittle time in order to learn to love me, you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is sure to be pretty angry at first,\" agreed Billie. \"You see I\r\nknow he has always hoped that I would marry Bream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bream! Bream Mortimer! What a silly thing to hope!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, I told you that Mr. Mortimer was father's best friend.\r\nThey are both over in England now, and are trying to get a house in the\r\ncountry for the summer which we can all share. I rather think the idea\r\nis to bring me and Bream closer together.\"\r\n\r\n\"How the deuce could that fellow be brought any closer to you? He's\r\nlike a burr as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was the idea, I'm sure. Of course, I could never look at\r\nBream now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate looking at him myself,\" said Sam feelingly.\r\n\r\nA group of afflicted persons, bent upon playing with long sticks and\r\nbits of wood, now invaded the upper deck. Their weak-minded cries\r\nfilled the air. Sam and the girl rose.\r\n\r\n\"Touching on your father once more,\" he said as they made their way\r\nbelow, \"is he a very formidable sort of man?\"\r\n\r\n\"He can be a dear. But he's rather quick-tempered. You must be very\r\ningratiating.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will practise it in front of the glass every morning for the rest of\r\nthe voyage,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe went down to the stateroom in a mixed mood of elation and\r\napprehension. He was engaged to the most wonderful girl in the world,\r\nbut over the horizon loomed the menacing figure of Father. He wished he\r\ncould induce Billie to allow him to waive the formality of thawing\r\nFather. Eustace Hignett had apparently been able to do so. But that\r\nexperience had presumably engendered a certain caution in her. The\r\nHignett fiasco had spoiled her for runaway marriages. Well, if it had\r\nto be done, it must be done, and that was all there was to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" cried Eustace Hignett.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the figure which loomed above him in the fading light\r\nwhich came through the porthole of the stateroom. The hour was\r\nseven-thirty and he had just woken from a troubled doze, full of\r\nstrange nightmares, and for the moment he thought that he must still be\r\ndreaming, for the figure before him could have walked straight into any\r\nnightmare and no questions asked. Then suddenly he became aware that it\r\nwas his cousin, Samuel Marlowe. As in the historic case of father in\r\nthe pigstye, he could tell him by his hat. But why was he looking like\r\nthat? Was it simply some trick of the uncertain light, or was his face\r\nreally black and had his mouth suddenly grown to six times its normal\r\nsize and become a vivid crimson?\r\n\r\nSam turned. He had been looking at himself in the mirror with a\r\nsatisfaction which, to the casual observer, his appearance would not\r\nhave seemed to justify. Hignett had not been suffering from a delusion.\r\nHis cousin's face was black; and, even as he turned, he gave it a dab\r\nwith a piece of burnt cork and made it blacker.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo! You awake?\" he said and switched on the light.\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett shied like a startled horse. His friend's profile, seen\r\ndimly, had been disconcerting enough. Full face, he was a revolting\r\nobject. Nothing that Eustace Hignett had encountered in his recent\r\ndreams--and they had included such unusual fauna as elephants in top\r\nhats and running shorts--had affected him so profoundly. Sam's\r\nappearance smote him like a blow. It seemed to take him straight into a\r\ndifferent and dreadful world.\r\n\r\n\"What ... what ... what...?\" he gurgled.\r\n\r\nSam squinted at himself in the glass and added a touch of black to his\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n\"How do I look?\"\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett began to fear that his cousin's reason must have become\r\nunseated. He could not conceive of any really sane man, looking like\r\nthat, being anxious to be told how he looked.\r\n\r\n\"Are my lips red enough? It's for the ship's concert, you know. It\r\nstarts in half an hour, though I believe I'm not on till the second part.\r\nSpeaking as a friend, would you put a touch more black round the ears,\r\nor are they all right?\"\r\n\r\nCuriosity replaced apprehension in Hignett's mind.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth are you doing performing at the ship's concert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they roped me in. It got about somehow that I was a valuable man\r\nand they wouldn't take no.\" Sam deepened the colour of his ears. \"As a\r\nmatter of fact,\" he said casually, \"my fiancee made rather a point of\r\nmy doing something.\"\r\n\r\nA sharp yell from the lower berth proclaimed the fact that the\r\nsignificance of the remark had not been lost on Eustace.\r\n\r\n\"Your fiancee?\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl I'm engaged to. Didn't I tell you about that? Yes, I'm\r\nengaged.\"\r\n\r\nEustace sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n\"I feared the worst. Tell me, who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curious! I must have forgotten.\" He hummed an airy strain as he\r\nblackened the tip of his nose. \"It's rather a curious coincidence,\r\nreally. Her name is Bennett.\"\r\n\r\n\"She may be a relation.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true. Of course, girls do have relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is her first name?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is another rather remarkable thing. It's Wilhelmina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelmina!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, there must be hundreds of girls in the world called\r\nWilhelmina Bennett, but still it is a coincidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"What colour is her hair?\" demanded Eustace Hignett in a hollow voice.\r\n\"Her hair! What colour is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her hair? Now, let me see. You ask me what colour is her hair. Well,\r\nyou might call it auburn ... or russet ... or you might call it Titian....\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind what you might call it. Is it red?\"\r\n\r\n\"Red? Why, yes. That is a very good description of it. Now that you put\r\nit to me like that, it _is_ red.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has she a trick of grabbing at you suddenly, when she gets excited,\r\nlike a kitten with a ball of wool?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Yes, she has.\"\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett uttered a sharp cry.\r\n\r\n\"Sam,\" he said, \"can you bear a shock?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have a dash at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brace up!\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl you are engaged to is the same girl who promised to marry\r\n_me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\n\"Awfully sorry, of course, and all that,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Don't apologise to me!\" said Eustace. \"My poor old chap, my only\r\nfeeling towards you is one of the purest and profoundest pity.\" He\r\nreached out and pressed Sam's hand. \"I regard you as a toad beneath the\r\nharrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose that's one way of offering congratulations and cheery\r\ngood wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on top of that,\" went on Eustace, deeply moved. \"You have got to\r\nsing at the ship's concert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't I sing at the ship's concert?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear old man, you have many worthy qualities, but you must know\r\nthat you can't sing. You can't sing for nuts! I don't want to\r\ndiscourage you, but, long ago as it is, you can't have forgotten what\r\nan ass you made of yourself at that house-supper at school. Seeing\r\nyou up against it like this, I regret that I threw a lump of butter at\r\nyou on that occasion, though at the time it seemed the only course to\r\npursue.\"\r\n\r\nSam started.\r\n\r\n\"Was it you who threw that bit of butter?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I'd known! You silly chump, you ruined my collar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well, it's seven years ago. You would have had to send it to the\r\nwash anyhow by this time. But don't let us brood on the past. Let us\r\nput our heads together and think how we can get you out of this\r\nterrible situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to get out of it. I confidently expect to be the hit of\r\nthe evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hit of the evening! You! Singing!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to sing. I'm going to do that imitation of Frank Tinney\r\nwhich I did at the Trinity Smoker. You haven't forgotten that? You were\r\nat the piano taking the part of the conductor of the orchestra. What a\r\nriot I was--we were! I say, Eustace, old man, I suppose you don't feel\r\nwell enough to come up now and take your old part? You could do it\r\nwithout a rehearsal. You remember how it went ... 'Hullo, Ernest!' 'Hullo,\r\nFrank!' Why not come along?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only piano I will ever sit at will be one firmly fixed on a floor\r\nthat does not heave and wobble under me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! The boat's as steady as a rock now. The sea's like a\r\nmill-pond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, thanking you for your suggestion, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, then I shall have to get on as best I can with that fellow\r\nMortimer. We've been rehearsing all the afternoon and he seems to have\r\nthe hang of the thing. But he won't be really right. He has no pep, no\r\nvim. Still, if you won't ... well, I think I'll be getting along to his\r\nstateroom. I told him I would look in for a last rehearsal.\"\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind Sam, and Eustace Hignett, lying on his back,\r\ngave himself up to melancholy meditation. He was deeply disturbed by\r\nhis cousin's sad story. He knew what it meant being engaged to\r\nWilhelmina Bennett. It was like being taken aloft in a balloon and\r\ndropped with a thud on the rocks.\r\n\r\nHis reflections were broken by the abrupt opening of the door. Marlowe\r\nrushed in. Eustace peered anxiously out of his berth. There was too much\r\ncork on his cousin's face to allow of any real registering of emotion,\r\nbut he could tell from his manner that all was not well.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\nSam sank on the lounge.\r\n\r\n\"The bounder has quit!\"\r\n\r\n\"The bounder? What bounder?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one! Bream Mortimer, curse him! There may be others whom\r\nthoughtless critics rank as bounders, but he is the only man really\r\ndeserving of the title. He refuses to appear! He has walked out on the\r\nact! He has left me flat! I went into his stateroom just now, as\r\narranged, and the man was lying on his bunk, groaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said the sea was like a millpond.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't that! He's perfectly fit. But it seems that the silly ass\r\ntook it into his head to propose to Billie just before dinner--apparently\r\nhe's loved her for years in a silent, self-effacing way--and\r\nof course she told him that she was engaged to me, and the thing upset\r\nhim to such an extent that he says the idea of sitting down at a piano\r\nand helping me give an imitation of Frank Tinney revolts him. He says\r\nhe intends to spend the evening in bed, reading Schopenhauer. I hope it\r\nchokes him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is splendid! This lets you out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Lets me out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, now you won't be able to appear. Oh, you will be thankful for\r\nthis in years to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't I appear! Won't I dashed well appear! Do you think I'm going to\r\ndisappoint that dear girl when she is relying on me? I would rather\r\ndie!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can't appear without a pianist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got a pianist.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. A little undersized shrimp of a fellow with a green face and ears\r\nlike water-wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I know him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you do. He's you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you. You are going to sit at the piano to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to disappoint you, but it's impossible. I gave you my views\r\non the subject just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've altered them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you soon will, and I'll tell you why. If you don't get up out of\r\nthat damned berth you've been roosting in all your life, I'm going to\r\nring for J. B. Midgeley and I'm going to tell him to bring me a bit of\r\ndinner in here and I'm going to eat it before your eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you've had dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll have another. I feel just ready for a nice fat pork\r\nchop....\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop. Stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"A nice fat pork chop with potatoes and lots of cabbage,\" repeated Sam,\r\nfirmly. \"And I shall eat it here on this very lounge. Now, how do we\r\ngo?\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't do that!\" said Eustace piteously.\r\n\r\n\"I would and will.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shouldn't be any good at the piano. I've forgotten how the thing\r\nused to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't done anything of the kind. I come in and say, 'Hullo,\r\nErnest!' and you say 'Hullo, Frank!' and then you help me tell the\r\nstory about the Pullman car. A child could do your part of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there is some child on board....\"\r\n\r\n\"No! I want you. I shall feel safe with you. We've done it together\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"But honestly, I really don't think ... it isn't as if....\"\r\n\r\nSam rose and extended a finger towards the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\" cried Eustace Hignett. \"I'll do it!\"\r\n\r\nSam withdrew his finger.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" he said. \"We've just got time for a rehearsal while you're\r\ndressing. 'Hullo, Ernest!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Frank,\" said Eustace Hignett, brokenly, as he searched for his\r\nunfamiliar trousers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n\r\nShip's concerts are given in aid of the seamen's orphans and widows,\r\nand, after one has been present at a few of them, one seems to feel\r\nthat any right-thinking orphan or widow would rather jog along and take\r\na chance of starvation than be the innocent cause of such things. They\r\nopen with a long speech from the master of the ceremonies--so long, as\r\na rule, that it is only the thought of what is going to happen\r\nafterwards that enables the audience to bear it with fortitude. This\r\ndone, the amateur talent is unleashed, and the grim work begins.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after the all too brief intermission for rest and\r\nrecuperation that the newly formed team of Marlowe and Hignett was\r\nscheduled to appear. Previous to this there had been dark deeds done in\r\nthe quiet saloon. The lecturer on deep-sea fish had fulfilled his\r\nthreat and spoken at great length on a subject which, treated by a\r\nmaster of oratory, would have palled on the audience after ten or\r\nfifteen minutes; and at the end of fifteen minutes this speaker had only\r\njust got past the haddocks and was feeling his way tentatively through\r\nthe shrimps. 'The Rosary' had been sung and there was an uneasy doubt\r\nas to whether it was not going to be sung again after the interval--the\r\nlatest rumour being that the second of the rival lady singers had proved\r\nadamant to all appeals and intended to fight the thing out on the lines\r\nshe had originally chosen if they put her in irons.\r\n\r\nA young man recited 'Gunga Din' and, wilfully misinterpreting the\r\ngratitude of the audience that it was over for a desire for more, had\r\nfollowed it with 'Fuzzy-Wuzzy.' His sister--these things run in\r\nfamilies--had sung 'My Little Gray Home in the West'--rather sombrely,\r\nfor she had wanted to sing the 'Rosary,' and, with the same obtuseness\r\nwhich characterised her brother, had come back and rendered two\r\nplantation songs. The audience was now examining its programmes in the\r\ninterval of silence in order to ascertain the duration of the sentence\r\nstill remaining unexpired.\r\n\r\nIt was shocked to read the following:\r\n\r\n    7. A Little Imitation......S. Marlowe\r\n\r\nAll over the saloon you could see fair women and brave men wilting in\r\ntheir seats. Imitation...! The word, as Keats would have said, was\r\nlike a knell! Many of these people were old travellers, and their minds\r\nwent back wincingly, as one recalls forgotten wounds, to occasions when\r\nperformers at ships' concerts had imitated whole strings of Dickens'\r\ncharacters or, with the assistance of a few hats and a little false\r\nhair, had endeavored to portray Napoleon, Bismarck, Shakespeare and\r\nothers of the famous dead. In this printed line on the programme there\r\nwas nothing to indicate the nature or scope of the imitation which this\r\nS. Marlowe proposed to inflict upon them. They could only sit and wait\r\nand hope that it would be short.\r\n\r\nThere was a sinking of hearts as Eustace Hignett moved down the room\r\nand took his place at the piano. A pianist! This argued more singing.\r\nThe more pessimistic began to fear that the imitation was going to be\r\none of those imitations of well-known opera artistes which, though\r\nrare, do occasionally add to the horrors of ships' concerts. They\r\nstared at Hignett apprehensively. There seemed to them something\r\nominous in the man's very aspect. His face was very pale and set, the\r\nface of one approaching a task at which his humanity shudders. They\r\ncould not know that the pallor of Eustace Hignett was due entirely to\r\nthe slight tremor which, even on the calmest nights, the engines of an\r\nocean liner produce in the flooring of a dining saloon and to that\r\nfaint, yet well-defined, smell of cooked meats which clings to a room\r\nwhere a great many people have recently been eating a great many meals.\r\nA few beads of cold perspiration were clinging to Eustace Hignett's\r\nbrow. He looked straight before him with unseeing eyes. He was thinking\r\nhard of the Sahara.\r\n\r\nSo tense was Eustace's concentration that he did not see Billie\r\nBennett, seated in the front row. Billie had watched him enter with a\r\nlittle thrill of embarrassment. She wished that she had been content\r\nwith one of the seats at the back. But her friend Jane Hubbard, who\r\naccompanied her, had insisted on the front row.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid recognition for as long as possible, Billie now put\r\nup her fan and turned to Jane. She was surprised to see that her friend\r\nwas staring eagerly before her with a fixity almost equal to that of\r\nEustace.\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ the matter, Jane?\"\r\n\r\nJane Hubbard was a tall, handsome girl with large brown eyes. About\r\nher, as Bream Mortimer had said, there was something dynamic. The\r\ndaughter of an eminent explorer and big-game hunter, she had frequently\r\naccompanied her father on his expeditions. An out-doors girl.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that man at the piano?\" she whispered. \"Do you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I do,\" said Billie. \"His name is Hignett. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I met him on the Subway not long ago. Poor little fellow, how\r\nmiserable he looks!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment their conversation was interrupted. Eustace Hignett,\r\npulling himself together with a painful effort, raised his hands and\r\nstruck a crashing chord: and, as he did so, there appeared through the\r\ndoor at the far end of the saloon a figure at the sight of which the\r\nentire audience started convulsively with a feeling that a worse thing\r\nhad befallen them than even they had looked for.\r\n\r\nThe figure was richly clad in some scarlet material. Its face was a\r\ngrisly black and below the nose appeared what seemed a horrible gash.\r\nIt advanced towards them, smoking a cigar.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Ernest,\" it said.\r\n\r\nAnd then it seemed to pause expectantly, as though desiring some reply.\r\nDead silence reigned in the saloon.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Ernest!\"\r\n\r\nThose nearest the piano--and nobody more quickly than Jane Hubbard--now\r\nobserved that the white face of the man on the stool had grown whiter\r\nstill. His eyes gazed out glassily from under his damp brow. He looked\r\nlike a man who was seeing some ghastly sight. The audience sympathised\r\nwith him. They felt like that, too.\r\n\r\nIn all human plans there is ever some slight hitch, some little\r\nmiscalculation which just makes all the difference. A moment's thought\r\nshould have told Eustace Hignett that a half-smoked cigar was one of\r\nthe essential properties to any imitation of the eminent Mr. Tinney:\r\nbut he had completely overlooked the fact. The cigar came as an\r\nabsolute surprise to him and it could not have affected him more\r\npowerfully if it had been a voice from the tomb. He stared at it\r\npallidly, like Macbeth at the ghost of Banquo. It was a strong, lively\r\nyoung cigar, and its curling smoke played lightly about his nostrils.\r\nHis jaw fell. His eyes protruded. He looked for a long moment like one\r\nof those deep-sea fishes concerning which the recent lecturer had\r\nspoken so searchingly. Then with the cry of a stricken animal, he\r\nbounded from his seat and fled for the deck.\r\n\r\nThere was a rustle of millinery at Billie's side as Jane Hubbard rose\r\nand followed him. Jane was deeply stirred. Even as he sat, looking so\r\npale and piteous, at the piano, her big heart had gone out to him, and\r\nnow, in his moment of anguish, he seemed to bring to the surface\r\neverything that was best and most compassionate in her nature.\r\nThrusting aside a steward who happened to be between her and the door,\r\nshe raced in pursuit.\r\n\r\nSam Marlowe had watched his cousin's dash for the open with a\r\nconsternation so complete that his sense seemed to have left him. A\r\ngeneral, deserted by his men on some stricken field, might have felt\r\nsomething akin to his emotion. Of all the learned professions, the\r\nimitation of Mr. Frank Tinney is the one which can least easily be\r\ncarried through single-handed. The man at the piano, the leader of the\r\norchestra, is essential. He is the life-blood of the entertainment.\r\nWithout him, nothing can be done.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Sam stood there, gaping blankly. Then the open door of\r\nthe saloon seemed to beckon an invitation. He made for it, reached it,\r\npassed through it. That concluded his efforts in aid of the Seamen's\r\nOrphans and Widows.\r\n\r\nThe spell which had lain on the audience broke. This imitation seemed\r\nto them to possess in an extraordinary measure the one quality which\r\nrenders amateur imitations tolerable, that of brevity. They had seen\r\nmany amateur imitations, but never one as short as this. The saloon\r\nechoed with their applause.\r\n\r\nIt brought no balm to Samuel Marlowe. He did not hear it. He had fled\r\nfor refuge to his stateroom and was lying in the lower berth, chewing\r\nthe pillow, a soul in torment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a tap at the door. Sam sat up dizzily. He had lost all count\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a note for you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the level voice of J. B. Midgeley, the steward. The stewards of\r\nthe White Star Line, besides being the civillest and most obliging body\r\nof men in the world, all have soft and pleasant voices. A White Star\r\nsteward, waking you up at six-thirty, to tell you that your bath is\r\nready, when you wanted to sleep on till twelve, is the nearest human\r\napproach to the nightingale.\r\n\r\n\"A what?\"\r\n\r\n\"A note, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSam jumped up and switched on the light. He went to the door and took\r\nthe note from J. B. Midgeley, who, his mission accomplished, retired in\r\nan orderly manner down the passage. Sam looked at the letter with a\r\nthrill. He had never seen the hand-writing before, but, with the eye of\r\nlove, he recognized it. It was just the sort of hand he would have\r\nexpected Billie to write, round and smooth and flowing, the writing of a\r\nwarm-hearted girl. He tore open the envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Please come up to the top deck. I want to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\nSam could not disguise it from himself that he was a little\r\ndisappointed. I don't know if you see anything wrong with the letter,\r\nbut the way Sam looked at it was that, for a first love-letter, it\r\nmight have been longer and perhaps a shade warmer. And, without running\r\nany risk of writer's cramp, she might have signed it.\r\n\r\nHowever, these were small matters. No doubt she had been in a hurry and\r\nall that sort of thing. The important point was that he was going to\r\nsee her. When a man's afraid, sings the bard, a beautiful maid is a\r\ncheering sight to see; and the same truth holds good when a man has\r\nmade an exhibition of himself at a ship's concert. A woman's gentle\r\nsympathy, that was what Samuel Marlowe wanted more than anything else\r\nat the moment. That, he felt, was what the doctor ordered. He scrubbed\r\nthe burnt cork off his face with all possible speed and changed his\r\nclothes and made his way to the upper deck. It was like Billie, he\r\nfelt, to have chosen this spot for their meeting. It would be deserted\r\nand it was hallowed for them both by sacred associations.\r\n\r\nShe was standing at the rail, looking out over the water. The moon was\r\nquite full. Out on the horizon to the south its light shone on the sea,\r\nmaking it look like the silver beach of some distant fairy island.\r\nThe girl appeared to be wrapped in thought, and it was not till the\r\nsharp crack of Sam's head against an overhanging stanchion announced\r\nhis approach that she turned.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is that you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't an easy job,\" explained Sam, \"getting all that burnt cork\r\noff. You've no notion how the stuff sticks. You have to use butter....\"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I did. You have to with burnt cork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me these horrible things.\" Her voice rose almost\r\nhysterically. \"I never want to hear the words burnt cork mentioned\r\nagain as long as I live.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel exactly the same.\" Sam moved to her side.\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" he said in a low voice, \"it was like you to ask me to meet\r\nyou here. I know what you were thinking. You thought that I should need\r\nsympathy. You wanted to pet me, to smooth my wounded feelings, to hold\r\nme in your arms, and tell me that, as we loved each other, what did\r\nanything else matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you didn't! I thought you did!\" He looked at her wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" he said, \"that possibly you might have wished to comfort\r\nme. I have been through a great strain. I have had a shock....\"\r\n\r\n\"And what about me?\" she demanded passionately. \"Haven't I had a\r\nshock?\"\r\n\r\nHe melted at once.\r\n\r\n\"Have you had a shock, too? Poor little thing! Sit down and tell me all\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked away from him, her face working.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you understand what a shock I have had? I thought you were the\r\nperfect knight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said it was a perfect night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I thought _you_ were a perfect knight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ah!\"\r\n\r\nA sailor crossed the deck, a dim figure in the shadows, went over to a\r\nsort of raised summerhouse with a brass thingummy in it, fooled about\r\nfor a moment, and went away again. Sailors earn their money easily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Sam when he had gone.\r\n\r\n\"I forget what I was saying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something about my being the perfect knight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I thought you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're not!\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\nSilence fell. Sam was feeling hurt and bewildered. He could not\r\nunderstand her mood. He had come up expecting to be soothed and\r\ncomforted and she was like a petulant iceberg. Cynically, he recalled\r\nsome lines of poetry which he had had to write out a hundred times on\r\none occasion at school as a punishment for having introduced a white\r\nmouse into chapel.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, woman in our hours of ease,\r\n    Un-something, something, something, please.\r\n    When tiddly-umpty umpty brow,\r\n    A something, something, something, thou!\"\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten the exact words, but the gist of it had been that\r\nwoman, however she might treat a man in times of prosperity, could be\r\nrelied on to rally round and do the right thing when he was in trouble.\r\nHow little the poet had known women.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he said huffily.\r\n\r\nShe gave a little sob.\r\n\r\n\"I put you on a pedestal and I find you have feet of clay. You have\r\nblurred the image which I formed of you. I can never think of you again\r\nwithout picturing you as you stood in that saloon, stammering and\r\nhelpless....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what can you do when your pianist runs out on you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You could have done _something_. I can't forgive a man for\r\nlooking ridiculous. Oh, what, what,\" she cried, \"induced you to try to\r\ngive an imitation of Bert Williams?\"\r\n\r\nSam started, stung to the quick.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't Bert Williams. It was Frank Tinney!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how was I to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did my best,\" said Sam sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"That is the awful thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did it for your sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. It gives me a horrible sense of guilt.\" She, shuddered again.\r\nThen suddenly, with the nervous quickness of a woman unstrung, thrust a\r\nsmall black golliwog into his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Take it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\"\r\n\r\n\"You bought it for me yesterday at the barber's shop. It is the only\r\npresent that you have given me. Take it back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want it. I shouldn't know what to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must take it,\" she said in a low voice. \"It is a symbol.\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\"\r\n\r\n\"A symbol of our broken love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you make that out. It's a golliwog.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can never marry you now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Good heavens! Don't be absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, go on, have a dash at it,\" he said encouragingly, though his heart\r\nwas sinking.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"No, I couldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hang it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't. I'm a strange girl....\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a darned silly girl....\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what right you have to say that,\" she flared.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what right you have to say you can't marry me and try to\r\nload me up with golliwogs,\" he retorted with equal heat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, can't you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm dashed if I can.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him despondently.\r\n\r\n\"When I said I would marry you, you were a hero to me. You stood to me\r\nfor everything that was noble and brave and wonderful. I had only to\r\nshut my eyes to conjure up the picture of you as you dived off the rail\r\nthat morning. Now\"--her voice trembled--\"if I shut my eyes now,--I can\r\nonly see a man with a hideous black face making himself the laughing\r\nstock of the ship. How can I marry you, haunted by that picture?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, good heavens, you talk as if I made a habit of blacking up! You\r\ntalk as if you expected me to come to the altar smothered in burnt cork.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall always think of you as I saw you to-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him sadly, \"There's a bit of black still on your left\r\near.\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to take her hand. But she drew it away. He fell back as if\r\nstruck.\r\n\r\n\"So this is the end,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It's partly on your ear and partly on your cheek.\"\r\n\r\n\"So this is the end,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"You had better go below and ask your steward to give you some more\r\nbutter.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I might have expected it, I might have known what would happen!\r\nEustace warned me. Eustace was right. He knows women--as I do--now.\r\nWomen! What mighty ills have not been done by women? Who was't betrayed\r\nthe what's-its-name? A woman! Who lost ... lost ... who lost ...\r\nwho--er--and so on? A woman ... So all is over! There is nothing to be\r\nsaid but good-bye?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, then, Miss Bennett!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" said Billie sadly. \"I--I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You do understand, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have made everything perfectly clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope--I hope you won't be unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy!\" Sam produced a strangled noise from his larynx, like the cry\r\nof a shrimp in pain. \"Unhappy! I'm not unhappy! Whatever gave you that\r\nidea? I'm smiling! I'm laughing! I feel I've had a merciful escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very unkind and rude of you to say that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It reminds me of a moving picture I saw in New York. It was called\r\n'Saved from the Scaffold.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not unhappy. What have I got to be unhappy about? What on earth\r\ndoes any man want to get married for? I don't ... Give me my gay\r\nbachelor life! My uncle Charlie used to say 'It's better luck to get\r\nmarried than it is to be kicked in the head by a mule.' But _he_\r\nwas an optimist. Good-night, Miss Bennett. And good-bye--for ever.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel and strode across the deck. From a white heaven\r\nthe moon still shone benignantly down, mocking him. He had spoken\r\nbravely: the most captious critic could not but have admitted that he\r\nhad made a good exit. But already his heart was aching.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near to his stateroom, he was amazed and disgusted to hear a\r\nhigh tenor voice raised in song proceeding from behind the closed door.\r\n\r\n   \"I fee-er naw faw in shee-ining arr-mor,\r\n   Though his lance be sharrrp and-er keen;\r\n   But I fee-er, I fee-er the glah-mour\r\n   Therough thy der-rooping lashes seen:\r\n   I fee-er, I fee-er the glah-mour....\"\r\n\r\nSam flung open the door wrathfully. That Eustace Hignett should still\r\nbe alive was bad--he had pictured him hurling himself overboard and\r\nbobbing about, a pleasing sight, in the wake of the vessel; that he\r\nshould be singing was an outrage. Remorse, Sam thought should have\r\nstricken Eustace Hignett dumb. Instead of which, here he was comporting\r\nhimself like a blasted linnet. It was all wrong. The man could have no\r\nconscience whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said sternly, \"so there you are!\"\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett looked up brightly, even beamingly. In the brief\r\ninterval which had elapsed since Sam had seen him last, an\r\nextraordinary transformation had taken place in this young man.\r\nHis wan look had disappeared. His eyes were bright. His face wore\r\nthat beastly self-satisfied smirk which you see in pictures advertising\r\ncertain makes of fine-mesh underwear. If Eustace Hignett had been\r\na full-page drawing in a magazine with \"My dear fellow, I always\r\nwear Sigsbee's Superfine Featherweight!\" printed underneath him, he\r\ncould not have looked more pleased with himself.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" he said. \"I was wondering where you had got to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Sam coldly, \"where I had got to! Where did you get\r\nto, and why? You poor, miserable worm,\" he went on in a burst of\r\ngenerous indignation, \"what have you to say for yourself? What do you\r\nmean by dashing away like that and killing my little entertainment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Awfully sorry, old man. I hadn't foreseen the cigar. I was bearing up\r\ntolerably well till I began to sniff the smoke. Then everything seemed\r\nto go black--I don't mean you, of course. You were black already--and I\r\ngot the feeling that I simply must get on deck and drown myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why didn't you?\" demanded Sam, with a strong sense of injury.\r\n\"I might have forgiven you then. But to come down here and find you\r\nsinging....\"\r\n\r\nA soft light came into Eustace Hignett's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I want to tell you all about that,\" he said, \"It's the most\r\nastonishing story. A miracle, you might almost call it. Makes you\r\nbelieve in Fate and all that sort of thing. A week ago I was on the\r\nSubway in New York....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off while Sam cursed him, the Subway, and the city of New\r\nYork, in the order named.\r\n\r\n\"My dear chap, what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter? Ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Something is the matter,\" persisted Eustace Hignett, \"I can tell it by\r\nyour manner. Something has happened to disturb and upset you. I know\r\nyou so well that I can pierce the mask. What is it? Tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely can't still be brooding on that concert business? Why,\r\nthat's all over. I take it that after my departure you made the most\r\ncolossal ass of yourself, but why let that worry you? These things\r\ncannot affect one permanently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't they? Let me tell you that as a result of that concert my\r\nengagement is broken off.\"\r\n\r\nEustace sprang forward with outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\"Not really? How splendid! Accept my congratulations! This is the\r\nfinest thing that could possibly have happened. These are not idle\r\nwords. As one who has been engaged to the girl himself, I speak\r\nfeelingly. You are well out of it, Sam.\"\r\n\r\nSam thrust aside his hand. Had it been his neck he might have clutched\r\nit eagerly, but he drew the line at shaking hands with Eustace Hignett.\r\n\r\n\"My heart is broken,\" he said with dignity.\r\n\r\n\"That feeling will pass, giving way to one of devout thankfulness. I\r\nknow! I've been there. After all ... Wilhelmina Bennett ... what is\r\nshe? A rag and a bone and a hank of hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is nothing of the kind,\" said Sam, revolted.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" said Eustace firmly, \"I speak as an expert. I know her and\r\nI repeat, she is a rag and a bone and a hank of hair!\"\r\n\r\n\"She is the only girl in the world, and owing to your idiotic behaviour\r\nI have lost her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak of the only girl in the world,\" said Eustace blithely. \"If\r\nyou want to hear about the only girl in the world, I will tell you. A\r\nweek ago I was in the Subway in New York....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to bed,\" said Sam brusquely.\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'll tell you while you're undressing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"A week ago,\" said Eustace Hignett, \"I will ask you to picture me\r\nseated after some difficulty in a carriage in a New York subway; I got\r\ninto conversation with a girl with an elephant gun.\"\r\n\r\nSam revised his private commination service in order to include the\r\nelephant gun.\r\n\r\n\"She was my soul-mate,\" proceeded Eustace with quiet determination. \"I\r\ndidn't know it at the time, but she was. She had grave brown eyes, a\r\nwonderful personality, and this elephant gun. She was bringing the gun\r\naway from the down-town place where she had taken it to be mended.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she shoot you with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot me? What do you mean? Why, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl must have been a fool!\" said Sam bitterly. \"The chance of a\r\nlife-time and she missed it. Where are my pyjamas?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't seen your pyjamas. She talked to me about this elephant gun,\r\nand explained its mechanism. You can imagine how she soothed my aching\r\nheart. My heart, if you recollect, was aching at the moment--quite\r\nunnecessarily if I had only known--because it was only a couple of days\r\nsince my engagement to Wilhelmina Bennett had been broken off. Well, we\r\nparted at Sixty-sixth Street, and, strange as it may seem, I forgot all\r\nabout her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell it again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, no! Forget all about her again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Eustace Hignett gravely, \"could make me do that. Our\r\nsouls have blended. Our beings have called to one another from their\r\ndeepest depths, saying ... There are your pyjamas, over in the\r\ncorner ... saying, 'You are mine!' How could I forget her after that?\r\nWell, as I was saying, we parted. Little did I know that she was\r\nsailing on this very boat! But just now she came to me as I writhed on\r\ndeck....\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you writhe?\" asked Sam with a flicker of moody interest.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly did.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good!\"\r\n\r\n\"But not for long.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's bad!\"\r\n\r\n\"She came to me and healed me. Sam, that girl is an angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Switch off the light when you've finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"She seemed to understand without a word how I was feeling. There are\r\nsome situations which do not need words. She went away and returned\r\nwith a mixture of some kind in a glass.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what it was. It had Worcester sauce in it. She put it to\r\nmy lips. She made me drink it. She said it was what her father always\r\nused in Africa for bull-calves with the staggers. Well, believe me or\r\nbelieve me not ... Are you asleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Believe me or believe me not, in under two minutes I was not merely\r\nfreed from the nausea caused by your cigar. I was smoking myself! I was\r\nwalking the deck with her without the slightest qualm. I was even able\r\nto look over the side from time to time and comment on the beauty\r\nof the moon on the water ... I have said some mordant things about women\r\nsince I came on board this boat. I withdraw them unreservedly. They\r\nstill apply to girls like Wilhelmina Bennett, but I have ceased to\r\ninclude the whole sex in my remarks. Jane Hubbard has restored my faith\r\nin woman. Sam! Sam!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said that Jane Hubbard had restored my faith in woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right.\"\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett finished undressing and got into bed. With a soft smile\r\non his face he switched off the light. There was a long silence, broken\r\nonly by the distant purring of engines. At about twelve-thirty a voice\r\ncame from the lower berth.\r\n\r\n\"Sam!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it now?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a sweet womanly strength about her, Sam. She was telling me\r\nshe once killed a panther with a hat-pin.\"\r\n\r\nSam groaned and tossed on his mattress.\r\n\r\nSilence fell again.\r\n\r\n\"At least I think it was a panther,\" said Eustace Hignett, at a quarter\r\npast one. \"Either a panther or a puma.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nA week after the liner Atlantic had docked at Southampton, Sam Marlowe\r\nmight have been observed--and was observed by various of the\r\nresidents--sitting on a bench on the esplanade of that repellent\r\nwatering-place, Bingley-on-the-Sea, in Sussex. All watering-places on\r\nthe South Coast of England are blots on the landscape, but, though I am\r\naware that by saying it I shall offend the civic pride of some of the\r\nothers, none are so peculiarly foul as Bingley-on-the-Sea. The asphalt\r\non the Bingley esplanade is several degrees more depressing than the\r\nasphalt on other esplanades. The Swiss waiters at the Hotel Magnificent,\r\nwhere Sam was stopping, are in a class of bungling incompetence by\r\nthemselves, the envy and despair of all the other Swiss waiters at all\r\nthe other Hotels Magnificent along the coast. For dreariness of aspect\r\nBingley-on-the-Sea stands alone. The very waves that break on the\r\nshingle seem to creep up the beach reluctantly, as if it revolted them\r\nto come to such a place.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, was Sam Marlowe visiting this ozone-swept Gehenna? Why, with\r\nall the rest of England at his disposal, had he chosen to spend a week\r\nat breezy, blighted Bingley?\r\n\r\nSimply because he had been disappointed in love. He had sought relief\r\nby slinking off alone to the most benighted spot he knew, in the same\r\nspirit as other men in similar circumstances had gone off to the\r\nRockies to shoot grizzly-bears.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent the experiment had proved successful. If the Hotel\r\nMagnificent had not cured his agony, the service and the cooking there\r\nhad at least done much to take his mind off it. His heart still ached,\r\nbut he felt equal to going to London and seeing his father, which, of\r\ncourse, he ought to have done immediately upon his arrival in England.\r\n\r\nHe rose from his bench, and, going back to the hotel to enquire about\r\ntrains, observed a familiar figure in the lobby. Eustace Hignett was\r\nleaning over the counter, in conversation with the desk-clerk.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Eustace!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Sam!\" said Eustace.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence. The conversational opening had been a little\r\nunfortunately chosen, for it reminded both men of a painful episode in\r\ntheir recent lives.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Eustace.\r\n\r\n\"What are _you_ doing here?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I came to see you,\" said Eustace, leading his cousin out of the lobby\r\nand onto the bleak esplanade. A fine rain had begun to fall, and\r\nBingley looked, if possible, worse than ever. \"I asked for you at your\r\nclub, and they told me you had come down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you want to see me about?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, old man, I'm in a bit of a hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather a long story,\" said Eustace deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know where to begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a dash at starting at the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nEustace stared gloomily at a stranded crab on the beach below. The crab\r\nstared gloomily back.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you remember my telling you about the girl I met on the boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jane Something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jane Hubbard,\" said Eustace reverently. \"Sam, I love that girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. You told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't tell _her_. I tried to muster up the nerve, but we\r\ngot to Southampton without my having clicked. What a dashed difficult\r\nthing a proposal is to bring off, isn't it! I didn't bring it off, and\r\nit began to look to me as though I was in the soup. And then she told\r\nme something which gave me an idea. She said the Bennetts had invited\r\nher to stay with them in the country when she got to England, Old Mr.\r\nBennett and his pal Mortimer, Bream's father, were trying to get a\r\nhouse somewhere which they could share. Only so far they hadn't managed\r\nto find the house they wanted. When I heard that, I said 'Ha!'\"\r\n\r\n\"You said what?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I said 'Ha!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I had an idea. Don't interrupt, old man, or you'll get me\r\nmuddled. Where was I?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember. I'd just got the idea. I happened to know, you see, that\r\nBennett and Mortimer were both frightfully keen on getting Windles for\r\nthe summer, but my mother wouldn't hear of it and gave them both the\r\nmiss-in-baulk. It suddenly occurred to me that mother was going to be\r\naway in America all the summer, so why shouldn't I make a private deal,\r\nlet them the house, and make it a stipulation that I was to stay there to\r\nlook after things? And, to cut a long story short, that's what I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"You let Windles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Old Bennett was down on the dock at Southampton to meet\r\nWilhelmina, and I fixed it up with him then and there. He was so bucked\r\nat the idea of getting the place that he didn't kick for a moment at\r\nthe suggestion that I should stick on at the house. Said he would be\r\ndelighted to have me there, and wrote out a fat check on the spot. We\r\nhired a car and drove straight over--it's only about twenty miles from\r\nSouthampton, you know,--and we've been there ever since. Bennett sent a\r\nwire to Mortimer, telling him to join us, and he came down next day.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and looked at Sam as though desiring comment. Sam had none\r\nto offer.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say you're in a hole?\" he asked. \"It seems to me as though\r\nyou had done yourself a bit of good. You've got the check, and you're\r\nin the same house with Miss Hubbard. What more do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose mother gets to hear about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"She'd be sorer than a sunburned neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably. But why should she hear of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I'm coming to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there some more of the story?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite a lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charge on,\" said Sam resignedly.\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett fixed a despondent gaze on the shingle, up which the\r\ngray waves were crawling with their usual sluggish air of wishing\r\nthemselves elsewhere. A rain-drop fell down the back of his neck, but\r\nhe did not notice it.\r\n\r\n\"It was the weather that really started it,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Started what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The trouble. What sort of weather have you been having here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't noticed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, down at Windles it has been raining practically all the time,\r\nand after about a couple of days it became fairly clear to me that\r\nBennett and Mortimer were getting a bit fed. I mean to say, having\r\nspent all their lives in America, don't you know, they weren't used to\r\na country where it rained all the time, and pretty soon it began to get\r\non their nerves. They started quarrelling. Nothing bad at first, but\r\nhotting up more and more, till at last they were hardly on speaking\r\nterms. Every little thing that happened seemed to get the wind up them.\r\nThere was that business of Smith, for instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer's bull-dog. Old Bennett is scared of him, and wants him kept\r\nin the stables, but Mortimer insists on letting him roam about the\r\nhouse. Well, they scrapped a goodish bit about that. And then there was\r\nthe orchestrion. You remember the orchestrion?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't been down at Windles since I was a kid.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. I forgot that. Well, my pater had an orchestrion put in\r\nthe drawing-room. One of these automatic things you switch on, you\r\nknow. Makes a devil of a row. Bennett can't stand it, and Mortimer\r\ninsists on playing it all day. Well, they hotted up a goodish bit over\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't see how all this affects you. If they want to scrap, why\r\nnot let them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but, you see, the most frightful thing has happened. At least, it\r\nhasn't happened yet, but it may any day. Bennett's talking about taking\r\nlegal advice to see if he can't induce Mortimer to cheese it by law as he\r\ncan't be stopped any other way. And the deuce of it is, your father's\r\nBennett's legal representative over in England, and he's sure to go\r\nto him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that'll do the pater a bit of good. Legal fees.\"\r\n\r\nEustace Hignett waved his arms despairingly at his cousin's obtuseness.\r\n\r\n\"But don't you see? If Bennett goes to your father about this binge,\r\nyour father will get onto the fact that Windles has been let, and he'll\r\nnose about and make enquiries, and the first thing that'll happen will\r\nbe that mother will get to hear of it, and then where shall I be?\"\r\n\r\nSam pondered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there's that,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now you see what a hole I'm in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are. What are you going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the only person who can help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can _I_ do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, your father wants you to join the firm, doesn't he? Well, for\r\ngoodness sake, buck up and join it. Don't waste a minute. Dash up to\r\nLondon by the next train, and sign on. Then, if Bennett does blow in\r\nfor advice, you can fix it somehow that he sees you instead of your\r\nfather, and it'll be all right. You can easily work it. Get the office-boy\r\nor somebody to tell Bennett that your father's engaged, but that you are\r\non the spot. He won't mind so long as he sees somebody in the firm.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't know anything about the law. What shall I say to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right. I've been studying it up a bit. As far as I can\r\ngather, this legal advice business is quite simple. Anything that isn't\r\na tort is a misdemeanour. You've simply got to tell old Bennett that in\r\nyour opinion the whole thing looks jolly like a tort.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the word again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tort.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Probably nobody knows. But it's a safe card to play.\r\nTort. Don't forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tort. Right ho!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, come along and pack your things. There's a train to London\r\nin about an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked back to the hotel. Sam gulped once or twice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, by the way,\" he said, \"Er--how is--er--Miss Bennett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she's all right.\" Eustace Hignett hummed a gay air. Sam's ready\r\nacquiescence in his scheme had relieved his apprehensive mind.\r\n\r\n\"Going strong?\" said Sam, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, absolutely. We're quite good friends again now. No use being in\r\nthe same house and not being on speaking terms. It's rummy how the\r\npassage of time sort of changes a fellow's point of view. Why, when she\r\ntold me about her engagement, I congratulated her as cheerfully as\r\ndammit! And only a few weeks ago....\"\r\n\r\n\"Her engagement!\" exclaimed Sam, leaping like a stricken blanc-mange.\r\n\"Her en-gug-gug-gagement!\"\r\n\r\n\"To Bream Mortimer, you know,\" said Eustace Hignett. \"She got engaged\r\nto him the day before yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe offices of the old-established firm of Marlowe, Thorpe, Prescott,\r\nWinslow and Appleby are in Ridgeway's Inn, not far from Fleet Street.\r\nIf you are a millionaire beset by blackmailers or anyone else to whose\r\ncomfort the best legal advice is essential, and have decided to put\r\nyour affairs in the hands of the ablest and discreetest firm in London,\r\nyou proceed through a dark and grimy entry and up a dark and grimy\r\nflight of stairs; and, having felt your way along a dark and grimy\r\npassage, you come at length to a dark and grimy door. There is plenty\r\nof dirt in other parts of Ridgeway's Inn, but nowhere is it so\r\nplentiful, so rich in alluvial deposits, as on the exterior of the\r\noffices of Marlowe, Thorpe, Prescott, Winslow and Appleby. As you tap\r\non the topmost of the geological strata concealing the ground-glass of\r\nthe door, a sense of relief and security floods your being. For in\r\nLondon grubbiness is the gauge of a lawyer's respectability.\r\n\r\nThe brass plate, let into the woodwork of this door, is misleading.\r\nReading it, you get the impression that on the other side quite a covey\r\nof lawyers await your arrival. The name of the firm leads you to\r\nsuppose that there will be barely standing-room in the office. You\r\npicture Thorpe jostling you aside as he makes for Prescott to discuss\r\nwith him the latest case of demurrer, and Winslow and Appleby treading\r\non your toes, deep in conversation on replevin. But these legal firms\r\ndwindle. The years go by and take their toll, snatching away here a\r\nPrescott, there an Appleby, till before you know where you are, you are\r\ndown to your last lawyer. The only surviving member of the firm of\r\nMarlowe, Thorpe--what I said before--was, at the time with which this\r\nstory deals, Sir Mallaby Marlowe, son of the original founder of the\r\nfirm and father of the celebrated black-faced comedian, Samuel of that\r\nilk; and the outer office, where callers were received and parked till\r\nSir Mallaby could find time for them, was occupied by a single clerk.\r\n\r\nWhen Sam, reaching the office after his journey, opened the door, this\r\nclerk, John Peters by name, was seated on a high stool, holding in one\r\nhand a half-eaten sausage, in the other an extraordinary large and\r\npowerful revolver. At the sight of Sam he laid down both engines of\r\ndestruction and beamed. He was not a particularly successful beamer,\r\nbeing hampered by a cast in one eye which gave him a truculent and\r\nsinister look; but those who knew him knew that he had a heart of gold\r\nand were not intimidated by his repellent face. Between Sam and himself\r\nthere had always existed terms of cordiality, starting from the time\r\nwhen the former was a small boy, and it had been Jno. Peters' mission\r\nto take him now to the Zoo, now to the train back to school.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Samuel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Peters!\"\r\n\r\n\"We were expecting you back a week ago. So you got back safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Safe? Why, of course,\"\r\n\r\nPeters shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I confess that, when there was this delay in your coming here, I\r\nsometimes feared something might have happened to you. I recall\r\nmentioning it to the young lady who recently did me the honour to\r\npromise to become my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ocean liners aren't often wrecked nowadays.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking more of the brawls on shore. America's a dangerous\r\ncountry. But perhaps you were not in touch with the underworld?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Jno. Peters, significantly.\r\n\r\nHe took up the revolver, gave it a fond and almost paternal look, and\r\nreplaced it on the desk.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth are you doing with that thing?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Peters lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to America myself in a few days' time, Mr. Samuel. It's my\r\nannual holiday, and the guvnor's sending me over with papers in\r\nconnection with The People _v._ Schultz and Bowen. It's a big case\r\nover there. A client of ours is mixed up in it, an American gentleman.\r\nI am to take these important papers to his legal representative in New\r\nYork. So I thought it best to be prepared.\"\r\n\r\nThe first smile that he had permitted himself in nearly two weeks\r\nflitted across Sam's face.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth sort of place do you think New York is?\" he asked. \"It's\r\nsafer than London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but what about the underworld? I've seen these American films that\r\nthey send over here, Mr. Samuel. Every Saturday night regular I take my\r\nyoung lady to a cinema, and, I tell you, they teach you something. Did\r\nyou ever see 'Wolves of the Bowery'? There was a man in that in just my\r\nposition, carrying important papers, and what they didn't try to do to\r\nhim! No, I'm taking no chances, Mr. Samuel!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have said you were, lugging that thing about with you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Peters seemed wounded.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand the mechanism perfectly, and I am becoming a very\r\nfair shot. I take my little bite of food in here early and go and\r\npractice at the Rupert Street Rifle Range during my lunch hour. You'd\r\nbe surprised how quickly one picks it up. When I get home at night I\r\ntry how quick I can draw. You have to draw like a flash of lightning,\r\nMr. Samuel. If you'd ever seen a film called 'Two-Gun-Thomas' you'd\r\nrealise that. You haven't time to be loitering about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't,\" agreed Sam. \"Is my father in? I'd like to see him if he's\r\nnot busy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Peters, recalled to his professional duties, shed his sinister\r\nfront like a garment. He picked up a speaking tube and blew down it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Samuel to see you, Mr. Mallaby. Yes, sir, very good. Will you go\r\nright in, Mr. Samuel?\"\r\n\r\nSam proceeded to the inner office, and found his father dictating into\r\nthe attentive ear of Miss Milliken, his elderly and respectable\r\nstenographer, replies to his morning mail.\r\n\r\nThe grime which encrusted the lawyer's professional stamping ground did\r\nnot extend to his person. Sir Mallaby Marlowe was a dapper little man,\r\nwith a round, cheerful face and a bright eye. His morning coat had been\r\ncut by London's best tailor, and his trousers perfectly creased by a\r\nsedulous valet. A pink carnation in his buttonhole matched his healthy\r\ncomplexion. His golf handicap was twelve. His sister, Mrs. Horace\r\nHignett, considered him worldly.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sirs: We are in receipt of your favour and in reply beg to state\r\nthat nothing will induce us ... will induce us ... where did I put that\r\nletter? Ah! ... nothing will induce us ... oh, tell 'em to go to blazes,\r\nMiss Milliken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Sir Mallaby.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's that. Ready? Messrs. Brigney, Goole and Butterworth. What\r\ninfernal names these people have. Sirs, on behalf of our client ... oh,\r\nhullo, Sam!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a seat. I'm busy, but I'll be finished in a moment. Where was I,\r\nMiss Milliken?\"\r\n\r\n\"On behalf of our client....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. On behalf of our client, Mr. Wibblesley Eggshaw.... Where\r\nthese people get their names I'm hanged if I know. Your poor mother\r\nwanted to call you Hyacinth, Sam. You may not know it, but in the\r\n'nineties, when you were born, children were frequently christened\r\nHyacinth. Well, I saved you from that.\"\r\n\r\nHis attention was now diverted to his son, Sir Mallaby seemed to\r\nremember that the latter had just returned from a long journey, and\r\nthat he had not seen him for many weeks. He inspected him with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"Very glad to see you're back, Sam. So you didn't win?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I got beaten in the semi-finals.\"\r\n\r\n\"American amateurs are a very hot lot: the best ones. I suppose you\r\nwere weak on the greens, I warned you about that. You'll have to rub up\r\nyour putting before next year.\"\r\n\r\nAt the idea that any mundane pursuit as practising putting could appeal\r\nto his broken spirit now, Sam uttered a bitter laugh. It was as if\r\nDante had recommended some lost soul in the Inferno to occupy his mind\r\nby knitting jumpers.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you seem to be in great spirits,\" said Sir Mallaby approvingly.\r\n\"It's pleasant to hear your merry laugh again, isn't it, Miss\r\nMilliken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Extremely exhilarating,\" agreed the stenographer, adjusting her\r\nspectacles and smiling at Sam, for whom there was a soft spot in her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nA sense of the futility of life oppressed Sam. As he gazed in the glass\r\nthat morning, he had thought, not without a certain gloomy\r\nsatisfaction, how remarkably pale and drawn his face looked. And these\r\npeople seemed to imagine that he was in the highest spirits. His\r\nlaughter, which had sounded to him like the wailing of a demon, struck\r\nMiss Milliken as exhilarating.\r\n\r\n\"On behalf of our client, Mr. Wibblesley Eggshaw,\" said Sir Mallaby,\r\nswooping back to duty once more, \"we beg to state that we are prepared\r\nto accept service ... sounds like a tennis match, eh, Sam? It isn't,\r\nthough. This young ass, Eggshaw ... what time did you dock this\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I landed nearly a week ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"A week ago! Then what the deuce have you been doing with yourself?\r\nWhy haven't I seen you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been down at Bingley-on-the-Sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bingley! What on earth were you doing at that Godforsaken place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrestling with myself,\" said Sam with simple dignity.\r\n\r\nSir Mallaby's agile mind had leaped back to the letter which he was\r\nanswering.\r\n\r\n\"We should be glad to meet you.... Wrestling, eh! Well, I like a boy to\r\nbe fond of manly sports. Still, life isn't all athletics. Don't forget\r\nthat. Life is real! Life is ... how does it go, Miss Milliken?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Milliken folded her hands and shut her eyes, her invariable habit\r\nwhen called upon to recite.\r\n\r\n\"Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust\r\nthou art to dust returnest, Was not spoken of the soul. Art is long and\r\ntime is fleeting. And our hearts though stout and brave, Still like\r\nmuffled drums are beating Funeral marches to the grave. Lives of great\r\nmen all remind us we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave\r\nbehind us footsteps on the sands of Time. Let us then ...\" said Miss\r\nMilliken respectfully ... \"be up and doing....\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right, all right!\" said Sir Mallaby. \"I don't want it all.\r\nLife is real! Life is earnest, Sam. I want to speak to you about that when\r\nI've finished answering these infernal letters. Where was I? 'We should\r\nbe glad to meet you at any time, if you will make an appointment...'\r\nBingley-on-the-Sea! Good heavens! Why Bingley-on-the-Sea? Why not Margate,\r\nwhile you are about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Margate is too bracing. I did not wish to be braced. Bingley suited my\r\nmood. It was gray and dark, and it rained all the time, and the sea\r\nslunk about in the distance like some baffled beast....\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, becoming aware that his father was not listening. Sir\r\nMallaby's attention had returned to the letter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what's the good of answering the dashed thing at all?\" said Sir\r\nMallaby. \"Brigney, Goole and Butterworth know perfectly well that they\r\nhave got us in a cleft stick. Butterworth knows it better than Goole,\r\nand Brigney knows it better than Butterworth. This young fool, Eggshaw,\r\nSam, admits that he wrote the girl twenty-three letters, twelve of them\r\nin verse, and twenty-one specifically asking her to marry him, and he\r\ncomes to me and expects me to get him out of it. The girl is suing him\r\nfor ten thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"How like a woman!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Milliken bridled reproachfully at this slur on her sex. Sir\r\nMallaby took no notice of it whatever.\r\n\r\n\"... If you will make an appointment, when we can discuss the matter\r\nwithout prejudice. Get those typed, Miss Milliken. Have a cigar, Sam.\r\nMiss Milliken, tell Peters as you go out that I am occupied with a\r\nconference and can see nobody for half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Milliken had withdrawn, Sir Mallaby occupied ten seconds of\r\nthe period which he had set aside for communion with his son in staring\r\nsilently at him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you're back, Sam,\" he said at length. \"I want to have a talk\r\nwith you. You know, it's time you were settling down. I've been\r\nthinking about you while you were in America, and I've come to the\r\nconclusion that I've been letting you drift along. Very bad for a young\r\nman. You're getting on. I don't say you're senile, but you're not\r\ntwenty-one any longer, and at your age I was working like a beaver.\r\nYou've got to remember that life is--dash it! I've forgotten it again.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off and puffed vigorously into the speaking tube. \"Miss\r\nMilliken, kindly repeat what you were saying just now about life....\r\nYes, yes, that's enough!\" He put down the instrument. \"Yes, life is\r\nreal, life is earnest,\" he said, gazing at Sam seriously, \"and the\r\ngrave is not our goal. Lives of great men all remind us we can make our\r\nlives sublime. In fact, it's time you took your coat off and started\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite ready, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't hear what I said,\" exclaimed Sir Mallaby with a look of\r\nsurprise. \"I said it was time you began work.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I said I was quite ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my soul! You've changed your views a trifle since I saw you\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have changed them altogether.\"\r\n\r\nLong hours of brooding among the red plush settees in the lounge of the\r\nHotel Magnificent at Bingley-on-the-Sea had brought about this strange,\r\neven morbid, attitude of mind in Samuel Marlowe. Work, he had decided\r\neven before his conversation with Eustace, was the only medicine for\r\nhis sick soul. Here, he felt, in this quiet office, far from the tumult\r\nand noise of the world, in a haven of torts and misdemeanours and Vic.\r\nI Cap 3's, and all the rest of it, he might find peace. At any rate, it\r\nwas worth taking a stab at it.\r\n\r\n\"Your trip has done you good,\" said Sir Mallaby approvingly. \"The sea\r\nair has given you some sense. I'm glad of it. It makes it easier for me\r\nto say something else that I've had on my mind for a good while. Sam,\r\nit's time you got married.\"\r\n\r\nSam barked bitterly. His father looked at him with concern.\r\n\r\n\"Swallow some smoke the wrong way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was laughing,\" explained Sam with dignity.\r\n\r\nSir Mallaby shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to discourage your high spirit, but I must ask you to\r\napproach this matter seriously. Marriage would do you a world of good,\r\nSam. It would brace you up. You really ought to consider the idea. I\r\nwas two years younger than you are when I married your poor mother, and\r\nit was the making of me. A wife might make something of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why she shouldn't. There's lots of good in you, my boy,\r\nthough you may not think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I said it was impossible,\" said Sam coldly, \"I was referring to\r\nthe impossibility of the possibility.... I mean, that it was impossible\r\nthat I could possibly ... in other words, father, I can never marry. My\r\nheart is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your what?\"\r\n\r\n\"My heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool. There's nothing wrong with your heart. All our family\r\nhave had hearts like steam-engines. Probably you have been feeling a\r\nsort of burning. Knock off cigars and that will soon stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand me. I mean that a woman has treated me in a way\r\nthat has finished her whole sex as far as I am concerned. For me, women\r\ndo not exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't tell me about this,\" said Sir Mallaby, interested. \"When\r\ndid this happen? Did she jilt you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In America was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the boat.\"\r\n\r\nSir Mallaby chuckled heartily.\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy, you don't mean to tell me that you're taking a shipboard\r\nflirtation seriously. Why, you're expected to fall in love with a\r\ndifferent girl every time you go on a voyage. You'll get over this in a\r\nweek. You'd have got over it now if you hadn't gone and buried yourself\r\nin a depressing place like Bingley-on-the-Sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe whistle of the speaking-tube blew. Sir Mallaby put the instrument\r\nto his ear.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he turned to Sam. \"I shall have to send you away now, Sam.\r\nMan waiting to see me. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Milliken intercepted Sam as he made for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Sam!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, but will you be seeing Sir Mallaby again to-day? If so,\r\nwould you--I don't like to disturb him now, when he is busy--would you\r\nmind telling him that I inadvertently omitted a stanza. It runs,\" said\r\nMiss Milliken, closing her eyes, \"'Trust no future, howe'er pleasant.\r\nLet the dead past bury its dead! Act, act in the living Present, Heart\r\nwithin and God o'erhead!' Thank you so much. Good afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about the time when Sam Marlowe was having the momentous interview\r\nwith his father, described in the last chapter, Mr. Rufus Bennett woke\r\nfrom an after-luncheon nap in Mrs. Hignett's delightful old-world\r\nmansion, Windles, in the county of Hampshire. He had gone to his room\r\nafter lunch, because there seemed nothing else to do. It was still\r\nraining hard, so that a ramble in the picturesque garden was\r\nimpossible, and the only alternative to sleep, the society of Mr. Henry\r\nMortimer, had become peculiarly distasteful to Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written of great friendships between man and man,\r\nfriendships which neither woman can mar nor death destroy. Rufus\r\nBennett had always believed that his friendship for Mr. Mortimer was of\r\nthis order. They had been boys together in the same small town, and had\r\nkept together in after years. They had been Damon and Pythias, David\r\nand Jonathan. But never till now had they been cooped up together\r\nin an English country-house in the middle of a bad patch of English\r\nsummer weather. So this afternoon Mr. Bennett, in order to avoid his\r\nlife-long friend, had gone to bed.\r\n\r\nHe awoke now with a start, and a moment later realized what it was that\r\nhad aroused him. There was music in the air. The room was full of it.\r\nIt seemed to be coming up through the floor and rolling about in chunks\r\nall round his bed. He blinked the last fragments of sleep out of his\r\nsystem, and became filled with a restless irritability.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell violently, and presently there entered a grave, thin,\r\nintellectual man who looked like a duke, only more respectable. This\r\nwas Webster, Mr. Bennett's English valet.\r\n\r\n\"Is that Mr. Mortimer?\" he barked, as the door opened.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. It is I--Webster.\" Not even the annoyance of being summoned\r\nlike this from an absorbing game of penny nap in the housekeeper's room\r\nhad the power to make the valet careless of his grammar. \"I fancied\r\nthat I heard your bell ring, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder you could hear anything with that infernal noise going on,\"\r\nsnapped Mr. Bennett, \"Is Mr. Mortimer playing that--that damned\r\ngas-engine in the drawing-room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Tosti's Goodbye. A charming air, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charming air be--! Tell him to stop it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe valet withdrew like a duke leaving the royal presence, not actually\r\nwalking backwards, but giving the impression of doing so. Mr. Bennett\r\nlay in bed and fumed. Presently the valet returned. The music still\r\ncontinued to roll about the room.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to have to inform you, sir,\" said Webster, \"that Mr.\r\nMortimer declines to accede to your request.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he said that, did he!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the gist of his remarks, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you tell him I was trying to get to sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I understood him to reply that he should worry and get a\r\npain in the neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go down again and say that I insist on his stopping the thing. It's an\r\noutrage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, Webster, like the dove despatched from the Ark, was\r\nback again.\r\n\r\n\"I fear my mission has been fruitless, sir. Mr. Mortimer appears\r\nadamant on the point at issue.\"\r\n\r\n\"You gave him my message?\"\r\n\r\n\"Verbatim, sir. In reply Mr. Mortimer desired me to tell you that, if\r\nyou did not like it, you could do the other thing. I quote the exact\r\nwords, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, did he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good! Webster!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"When is the next train to London?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will ascertain, sir. Cook, I believe has a time-table.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and see, then. I want to know. And send Miss Wilhelmina to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat consoled by the thought that he was taking definite action,\r\nMr. Bennett lay back and waited for Billie.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to go to London,\" he said, when she appeared.\r\n\r\n\"To London? Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you why,\" said Mr. Bennett vehemently. \"Because of that pest\r\nMortimer. I must have legal advice. I want you to go and see Sir\r\nMallaby Marlowe. Here's his address. Tell him the whole story. Tell him\r\nthat this man is annoying me in every possible way and ask if he can't\r\nbe stopped. If you can't see Sir Mallaby himself, see someone else in\r\nthe firm. Go up to-night, so that you can see him first thing in the\r\nmorning. You can stop the night at the Savoy. I've sent Webster to look\r\nout a train.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a splendid train in about an hour. I'll take that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's giving you a lot of trouble,\" said Mr. Bennett with belated\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\" said Billie. \"I'm only too glad to be able to do something for\r\nyou, father dear. This noise is a terrible nuisance, isn't it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a good girl,\" said Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's right!\" said Sir Mallaby Marlowe. \"Work while you're young,\r\nSam, work while you're young.\" He regarded his son's bent head with\r\naffectionate approval. \"What's the book to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Widgery on Nisi prius Evidence,\" said Sam, without looking up.\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" said Sir Mallaby. \"Highly improving and as interesting as a\r\nnovel--some novels. There's a splendid bit on, I think, page two\r\nhundred and fifty-four where the hero finds out all about Copyhold and\r\nCustomary Estates. It's a wonderfully powerful situation. It appears--but\r\nI won't spoil it for you. Mind you don't skip to see how it all comes\r\nout in the end!\" Sir Mallaby suspended conversation while he addressed an\r\nimaginary ball with the mashie which he had taken out of his golf-bag.\r\nFor this was the day when he went down to Walton Heath for his weekly\r\nfoursome with three old friends. His tubby form was clad in tweed of a\r\nviolent nature, with knickerbockers and stockings. \"Sam!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam, a man at the club showed me a new grip the other day. Instead of\r\noverlapping the little finger of the right hand ... Oh, by the way, Sam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should lock up the office to-day if I were you, or anxious clients\r\nwill be coming in and asking for advice, and you'll find yourself in\r\ndifficulties. I shall be gone, and Peters is away on his holiday. You'd\r\nbetter lock the outer door.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Sam absently. He was finding Widgery stiff reading.\r\nHe had just got to the bit about Raptu Haeredis, which, as of course\r\nyou know, is a writ for taking away an heir holding insocage.\r\n\r\nSir Mallaby looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll have to be going. See you later, Sam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nSir Mallaby went out, and Sam, placing both elbows on the desk and\r\ntwining his fingers in his hair, returned with a frown of concentration to\r\nhis grappling with Widgery. For perhaps ten minutes the struggle was\r\nan even one, then gradually Widgery got the upper hand. Sam's mind,\r\nnumbed by constant batterings against the stony ramparts of legal\r\nphraseology, weakened, faltered, and dropped away; and a moment\r\nlater his thoughts, as so often happened when he was alone, darted\r\noff and began to circle round the image of Billie Bennett.\r\n\r\nSince they had last met, Sam had told himself perhaps a hundred times\r\nthat he cared nothing about Billie, that she had gone out of his life\r\nand was dead to him; but unfortunately he did not believe it. A man\r\ntakes a deal of convincing on a point like this, and Sam had never\r\nsucceeded in convincing himself for more than two minutes at a time. It\r\nwas useless to pretend that he did not still love Billie more than\r\never, because he knew he did; and now, as the truth swept over him for\r\nthe hundred and first time, he groaned hollowly and gave himself up to\r\nthe gray despair which is the almost inseparable companion of young men\r\nin his position.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was he in his meditation that he did not hear the light\r\nfootstep in the outer office, and it was only when it was followed by a\r\ntap on the door of the inner office that he awoke with a start to the\r\nfact that clients were in his midst. He wished that he had taken his\r\nfather's advice and locked up the office. Probably this was some\r\nfrightful bore who wanted to make his infernal will or something,\r\nand Sam had neither the ability nor the inclination to assist him.\r\n\r\nWas it too late to escape? Perhaps if he did not answer the knock, the\r\nblighter might think there was nobody at home. But suppose he opened\r\nthe door and peeped in? A spasm of Napoleonic strategy seized Sam. He\r\ndropped silently to the floor and concealed himself under the desk.\r\nNapoleon was always doing that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nThere was another tap. Then, as he had anticipated, the door opened.\r\nSam, crouched like a hare in its form, held his breath. It seemed to\r\nhim that he was going to bring this delicate operation off with\r\nsuccess. He felt he had acted just as Napoleon would have done in a\r\nsimilar crisis. And so, no doubt, he had to a certain extent; only\r\nNapoleon would have seen to it that his boots and about eighteen inches\r\nof trousered legs were not sticking out, plainly visible to all who\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" said a voice.\r\n\r\nSam thrilled from the top of his head to the soles of his feet. It was\r\nthe voice which had been ringing in his ears through all his waking\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\"Are you busy, Mr. Marlowe?\" asked Billie, addressing the boots.\r\n\r\nSam wriggled out from under the desk like a disconcerted tortoise.\r\n\r\n\"Dropped my pen,\" he mumbled, as he rose to the surface.\r\n\r\nHe pulled himself with an effort that was like a physical exercise. He\r\nstared at Billie dumbly. Then, recovering speech, he invited her to sit\r\ndown, and seated himself at the desk.\r\n\r\n\"Dropped my pen!\" he gurgled again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Fountain-pen,\" babbled Sam, \"with a broad nib.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"A broad gold nib,\" went on Sam, with the painful exactitude which\r\ncomes only from embarrassment or the early stages of intoxication.\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" said Billie, and Sam blinked and told himself resolutely that\r\nthis would not do. He was not appearing to advantage. It suddenly\r\noccurred to him that his hair was standing on end as the result\r\nof his struggle with Widgery. He smoothed it down hastily, and\r\nfelt a trifle more composed. The old fighting spirit of the Marlowes\r\nnow began to assert itself to some extent. He must make an effort to\r\nappear as little of a fool as possible in this girl's eyes. And what\r\neyes they were! Golly! Like stars! Like two bright planets in....\r\n\r\nHowever, that was neither here nor there. He pulled down his waistcoat\r\nand became cold and business-like--the dry young lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"Er--how do you do, Miss Bennett?\" he said with a question in his\r\nvoice, raising his eyebrows in a professional way. He modelled this\r\nperformance on that of lawyers he had seen on the stage, and wished he\r\nhad some snuff to take or something to tap against his front teeth.\r\n\"Miss Bennett, I believe?\"\r\n\r\nBillie drew herself up stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"How clever of you to remember me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a good memory.\"\r\n\r\n\"How nice! So have I!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which Billie allowed her gaze to travel\r\ncasually about the room. Sam occupied the intermission by staring\r\nfurtively at her profile. He was by now in a thoroughly overwrought\r\ncondition, and the thumping of his heart sounded to him as if workmen\r\nwere mending the street outside. How beautiful she looked, with that\r\nred hair peeping out beneath her hat and ... However!\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything I can do for you?\" he asked in the sort of voice\r\nWidgery might have used. Sam always pictured Widgery as a small man\r\nwith bushy eyebrows, a thin face, and a voice like a rusty file.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I really wanted to see Sir Mallaby.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father has been called away on important business to Walton Heath.\r\nCannot I act as his substitute?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about the law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I know anything about the law!\" echoed Sam, amazed. \"Do I know--!\r\nWhy, I was reading my Widgery on Nisi Prius Evidence when you came in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, were you?\" said Billie interested. \"Do you always read on the\r\nfloor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you I dropped my pen,\" said Sam coldly.\r\n\r\n\"And of course you couldn't read without that! Well, as a matter of\r\nfact, this has nothing to do with Nisi--what you said.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not specialised exclusively on Nisi Prius Evidence. I know the\r\nlaw in all its branches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what would you do if a man insisted on playing the orchestrion\r\nwhen you wanted to get to sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"The orchestrion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The orchestrion, eh? Ah! H'm!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"You still haven't made it quite clear,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you want to think!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me the facts,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Mortimer and my father have taken a house together in the\r\ncountry, and for some reason or other they have quarrelled, and now Mr.\r\nMortimer is doing everything he can to make father uncomfortable.\r\nYesterday afternoon father wanted to sleep, and Mr. Mortimer started\r\nhis orchestrion just to annoy him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think--I'm not quite sure--I think that's a tort,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"A what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Either a tort or a misdemeanour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you do know something about it after all!\" cried Billie, startled\r\ninto a sort of friendliness in spite of herself. And at the words and\r\nthe sight of her quick smile Sam's professional composure reeled on its\r\nfoundations. He had half risen, with the purpose of springing up and\r\nbabbling of the passion that consumed him, when the chill reflection\r\ncame to him that this girl had once said that she considered him\r\nridiculous. If he let himself go, would she not continue to think him\r\nridiculous? He sagged back into his seat and at that moment there came\r\nanother tap on the door which, opening, revealed the sinister face of\r\nthe holiday-making Peters.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Samuel,\" said Jno. Peters. \"Good morning, Miss\r\nMilliken. Oh!\"\r\n\r\nHe vanished as abruptly as he had appeared. He perceived that what he\r\nhad taken at first glance for the stenographer was a client, and that\r\nthe junior partner was engaged on a business conference. He left behind\r\nhim a momentary silence.\r\n\r\n\"What a horrible-looking man!\" said Billie, breaking it with a little\r\ngasp. Jno. Peters often affected the opposite sex like that at first\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Sam absently.\r\n\r\n\"What a dreadful-looking man! He quite frightened me!\"\r\n\r\nFor some moments Sam sat without speaking. If this had not been one of\r\nhis Napoleonic mornings, no doubt the sudden arrival of his old friend,\r\nMr. Peters, whom he had imagined at his home in Putney packing for his\r\ntrip to America, would have suggested nothing to him. As it was it\r\nsuggested a great deal. He had had a brain-wave, and for fully a minute\r\nhe sat tingling under its impact. He was not a young man who often had\r\nbrain-waves, and, when they came, they made him rather dizzy.\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" asked Billie. \"He seemed to know you? And who,\" she\r\ndemanded after a slight pause, \"is Miss Milliken?\"\r\n\r\nSam drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"It's rather a sad story,\" he said. \"His name is John Peters. He used\r\nto be clerk here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't he any longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Sam shook his head. \"We had to get rid of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder. A man looking like that....\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't that so much,\" said Sam. \"The thing that annoyed father was\r\nthat he tried to shoot Miss Milliken.\"\r\n\r\nBillie uttered a cry of horror!\r\n\r\n\"He tried to shoot Miss Milliken!\"\r\n\r\n\"He did shoot her--the third time,\" said Sam warming to his work. \"Only\r\nin the arm, fortunately,\" he added. \"But my father is rather a stern\r\ndisciplinarian and he had to go. I mean, we couldn't keep him after\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\"\r\n\r\n\"She used to be my father's stenographer, and she was thrown a good\r\ndeal with Peters. It was quite natural that he should fall in love with\r\nher. She was a beautiful girl, with rather your own shade of hair.\r\nPeters is a man of volcanic passions, and, when, after she had given\r\nhim to understand that his love was returned, she informed him one day\r\nthat she was engaged to a fellow at Ealing West, he went right off his\r\nonion--I mean, he became completely distraught. I must say that he\r\nconcealed it very effectively at first. We had no inkling of his\r\ncondition till he came in with the pistol. And, after that ... well, as I\r\nsay, we had to dismiss him. A great pity, for he was a good clerk.\r\nStill, it wouldn't do. It wasn't only that he tried to shoot Miss\r\nMilliken. That wouldn't have mattered so much, as she left after he had\r\nmade his third attempt, and got married. But the thing became an\r\nobsession with him, and we found that he had a fixed idea that every\r\nred-haired woman who came into the office was the girl who had deceived\r\nhim. You can see how awkward that made it. Red hair is so fashionable\r\nnowadays.\"\r\n\r\n\"My hair is red!\" whispered Billie pallidly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I noticed it myself. I told you it was much the same shade as\r\nMiss Milliken's. It's rather fortunate that I happened to be here with\r\nyou when he came.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he may be lurking out there still!\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect he is,\" said Sam carelessly. \"Yes, I suppose he is. Would you\r\nlike me to go and send him away? All right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but is it safe?\"\r\n\r\nSam uttered a light laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind taking a risk or two for your sake,\" he said, and\r\nsauntered from the room, closing the door behind him. Billie followed\r\nhim with worshipping eyes.\r\n\r\nJno. Peters rose politely from the chair in which he had seated himself\r\nfor more comfortable perusal of the copy of _Home Whispers_ which\r\nhe had brought with him to refresh his mind in the event of the firm being\r\ntoo busy to see him immediately. He was particularly interested in the\r\nseries of chats with Young Mothers.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Peters,\" said Sam. \"Want anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very sorry to have disturbed you, Mr. Samuel. I just looked in to say\r\ngood-bye. I sail on Saturday, and my time will be pretty fully taken up\r\nall the week. I have to go down to the country to get some final\r\ninstructions from the client whose important papers I am taking over.\r\nI'm sorry to have missed your father, Mr. Samuel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is his golf day, I'll tell him you looked in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything I can do before I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--\"--Jno. Peters coughed tactfully--\"I see that you are engaged\r\nwith a client, Mr. Samuel, and was wondering if any little point of law\r\nhad arisen with which you did not feel yourself quite capable of\r\ncoping, in which case I might perhaps be of assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that lady,\" said Sam. \"That was Miss Milliken's sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? I didn't know Miss Milliken had a sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"She is not very like her in appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. This one is the beauty of the family, I believe. A very bright,\r\nintelligent girl. I was telling her about your revolver just before you\r\ncame in, and she was most interested. It's a pity you haven't got it\r\nwith you now, to show to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I have! I have, Mr. Samuel!\" said Peters, opening a small\r\nhandbag and taking out a hymn-book, half a pound of mixed chocolates, a\r\ntongue sandwich, and the pistol, in the order named. \"I was on my way\r\nto the Rupert Street range for a little practice. I should be glad to\r\nshow it to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, wait here a minute or two,\" said Sam, \"I'll have finished\r\ntalking business in a moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned to the inner office.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" cried Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Eh? Oh, he's gone,\" said Sam. \"I persuaded him to go away. He was a\r\nlittle excited, poor fellow. And now let us return to what we were\r\ntalking about. You say....\" He broke off with an exclamation, and\r\nglanced at his watch. \"Good Heavens! I had no idea of the time. I\r\npromised to run up and see a man in one of the offices in the next\r\ncourt. He wants to consult me on some difficulty which has arisen with\r\none of his clients. Rightly or wrongly he values my advice. Can you\r\nspare me for a short while? I shan't be more than ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is something you may care to look at while I'm gone. I don't know\r\nif you have read it? Widgery on Nisi Prius Evidence. Most interesting.\"\r\n\r\nHe went out. Jno. Peters looked up from his _Home Whispers_.\r\n\r\n\"You can go in now,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Mr. Samuel, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nSam took up the copy of _Home Whispers_, and sat down with his\r\nfeet on the desk. He turned to the serial story and began to read the\r\nsynopsis.\r\n\r\nIn the inner room, Billie, who had rejected the mental refreshment\r\noffered by Widgery, and was engaged in making a tour of the office,\r\nlooking at the portraits of whiskered men whom she took correctly to be\r\nthe Thorpes, Prescotts, Winslows and Applebys mentioned on the\r\ncontents-bill outside, was surprised to hear the door open at her back.\r\nShe had not expected Sam to return so instantaneously.\r\n\r\nNor had he done so. It was not Sam who entered. It was a man of\r\nrepellent aspect whom she recognised instantly, for Jno. Peters was one\r\nof those men who, once seen, are not easily forgotten. He was smiling,\r\na cruel, cunning smile--at least, she thought he was; Mr. Peters\r\nhimself was under the impression that his face was wreathed in a\r\nbenevolent simper; and in his hand he bore the largest pistol ever seen\r\noutside a motion picture studio.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Miss Milliken?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\nBillie had been standing near the wall, inspecting a portrait of the\r\nlate Mr. Josiah Appleby, of which the kindest thing one can say is that\r\none hopes it did not do him justice. She now shrank back against this\r\nwall, as if she were trying to get through it. The edge of the\r\nportrait's frame tilted her hat out of the straight, but in this\r\nsupreme moment she did not even notice it.\r\n\r\n\"Er--how do you do?\" she said.\r\n\r\nIf she had not been an exceedingly pretty girl, one would have said\r\nthat she spoke squeakily. The fighting spirit of the Bennetts, though\r\nit was considerable fighting spirit, had not risen to this emergency.\r\nIt had ebbed out of her, leaving in its place a cold panic. She had\r\nseen this sort of thing in the movies--there was one series of\r\npictures, The Dangers of Diana, where something of the kind had\r\nhappened to the heroine in every reel--but she had not anticipated that\r\nit would ever happen to her: and consequently she had not thought out\r\nany plan for coping with such a situation. A grave error. In this world\r\none should be prepared for everything, or where is one? The best she\r\ncould do was to stand and stare at the intruder. It would have done Sam\r\nMarlowe good--he had now finished the synopsis and was skimming\r\nthrough the current instalment--if he could have known how she yearned\r\nfor his return.\r\n\r\n\"I've brought the revolver,\" said Mr. Peters.\r\n\r\n\"So--so I see!\" said Billie.\r\n\r\nMr. Peters nursed the weapon affectionately in his hand. He was rather\r\na shy man with women as a rule, but what Sam had told him about her\r\nbeing interested in his revolver had made his heart warm to this girl.\r\n\r\n\"I was just on my way to have a little practice at the range,\" he said.\r\n\"Then I thought I might as well look in here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose--I suppose you're a good shot?\" quavered Billie.\r\n\r\n\"I seldom miss,\" said Jno. Peters.\r\n\r\nBillie shuddered. Then, reflecting that the longer she engaged this\r\nmaniac in conversation, the more hope there was of Sam coming back in\r\ntime to save her, she essayed further small-talk.\r\n\r\n\"It's--it's very ugly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" said Mr. Peters, hurt.\r\n\r\nBillie perceived that she had said the wrong thing.\r\n\r\n\"Very deadly-looking, I meant,\" she corrected herself hastily.\r\n\r\n\"It may have deadly work to do, Miss Milliken,\" said Mr. Peters.\r\n\r\nConversation languished again. Billie had no further remarks to make of\r\nimmediate interest, and Mr. Peters was struggling with a return of the\r\ndeplorable shyness which so handicapped him in his dealings with the\r\nother sex. After a few moments, he pulled himself together again, and,\r\nas his first act was to replace the pistol in the pocket of his coat,\r\nBillie became conscious of a faint stirring of relief.\r\n\r\n\"The great thing,\" said Jno. Peters, \"is to learn to draw quickly. Like\r\nthis!\" he added, producing the revolver with something of the\r\nsmoothness and rapidity with which Billie, in happier moments, had seen\r\nconjurers take a bowl of gold fish out of a tall hat. \"Everything\r\ndepends on getting the first shot! The first shot, Miss Milliken, is\r\nvital.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Billie had an inspiration. It was hopeless she knew, to try to\r\nconvince this poor demented creature, obsessed with his _idee\r\nfixe_, that she was not Miss Milliken. Denial would be a waste of\r\ntime, and might even infuriate him into precipitating the tragedy. It was\r\nimperative that she should humour him. And, while she was humouring\r\nhim, it suddenly occurred to her, why not do it thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Peters,\" she cried, \"you are quite mistaken!\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Jno. Peters, with not a little asperity.\r\n\"Nothing of the kind!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are!\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you I am not. Quickness in the draw is essential.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been misinformed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I had it direct from the man at the Rupert Street range,\" said\r\nMr. Peters stiffly. \"And if you had ever seen a picture called Two-Gun\r\nThomas....\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Peters!\" cried Billie desperately. He was making her head swim\r\nwith his meaningless ravings. \"Mr. Peters, hear me! I am not married to\r\na man at Ealing West!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Peters betrayed no excitement at the information. This girl seemed\r\nfor some reason to consider her situation an extraordinary one, but\r\nmany women, he was aware, were in a similar position. In fact, he could\r\nnot at the moment think of any of his feminine acquaintances who\r\n_were_ married to men at Ealing West.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" he said politely.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you believe me?\" exclaimed Billie wildly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly, certainly,\" said Jno. Peters.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" said Billie. \"I'm not even engaged! It's all been a\r\nterrible mistake!\"\r\n\r\nWhen two people in a small room are speaking on two distinct and\r\ndifferent subjects and neither knows what on earth the other is driving\r\nat, there is bound to be a certain amount of mental confusion: but at\r\nthis point Jno. Peters, though still not wholly equal to the\r\nintellectual pressure of the conversation, began to see a faint shimmer\r\nof light behind the clouds. In a nebulous kind of way he began to\r\nunderstand that the girl had come to consult the firm about a\r\nbreach-of-promise action. Some unknown man at Ealing West had been\r\ntrifling with her heart--hardened lawyer's clerk as he was, that poignant\r\ncry \"I'm not engaged!\" had touched Mr. Peters--and she wished to start\r\nproceedings. Mr. Peters felt almost in his depth again. He put the\r\nrevolver in his pocket, and drew out a note-book.\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad to hear the facts,\" he said with professional\r\ncourtesy. \"In the absence of the Guv'nor....\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you the facts!\"\r\n\r\n\"This man at Ealing West,\" said Mr. Peters, moistening the point of his\r\npencil, \"he wrote you letters proposing marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" said Mr. Peters, disappointed but hopeful, \"he made love\r\nto you before witnesses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! Never! There is no man at Ealing West! There never was a man at\r\nEaling West!\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Jno. Peters began for the first time to\r\nentertain serious doubts of the girl's mental balance. The most\r\nelementary acquaintance with the latest census was enough to tell him\r\nthat there were any number of men at Ealing West. The place was full of\r\nthem. Would a sane woman have made an assertion to the contrary? He\r\nthought not, and he was glad that he had the revolver with him. She had\r\ndone nothing as yet actively violent, but it was nice to feel prepared.\r\nHe took it out and laid it nonchalantly in his lap.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the weapon acted on Billie electrically. She flung out her\r\nhands, in a gesture of passionate appeal, and played her last card.\r\n\r\n\"I love _you_!\" she cried. She wished she could have remembered\r\nhis first name. It would have rounded off the sentence neatly. In such\r\na moment she could hardly call him 'Mr. Peters.' \"You are the only man\r\nI love.\"\r\n\r\n\"My gracious goodness!\" ejaculated Mr. Peters, and nearly fell over\r\nbackwards. To a naturally shy man this sudden and wholly unexpected\r\ndeclaration was disconcerting: and the clerk was, moreover, engaged. He\r\nblushed violently. And yet, even in that moment of consternation, he\r\ncould not check a certain thrill. No man ever thinks he is as homely as\r\nhe really is, but Jno. Peters had always come fairly near to a correct\r\nestimate of his charms, and it had always seemed to him, that, in\r\ninducing his fiancee to accept him, he had gone some. He now began to\r\nwonder if he were not really rather a devil of a chap after all. There\r\nmust, he felt, be precious few men going about capable of inspiring\r\ndevotion like this on the strength of about six and a half minutes\r\ncasual conversation.\r\n\r\nCalmer thoughts succeeded this little flicker of complacency. The girl\r\nwas mad. That was the fact of the matter. He got up and began to edge\r\ntowards the door. Mr. Samuel would be returning shortly, and he ought\r\nto be warned.\r\n\r\n\"So that's all right, isn't it!\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite, quite!\" said Mr. Peters. \"Er--thank you very much!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would be pleased,\" said Billie, relieved, but puzzled.\r\nFor a man of volcanic passions, as Sam Marlowe had described him, he\r\nseemed to be taking the thing very calmly. She had anticipated a\r\nstrenuous scene.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's a great compliment,\" Mr. Peters assured her.\r\n\r\nAt this point Sam came in, interrupting the conversation at a moment\r\nwhen it had reached a somewhat difficult stage. He had finished the\r\ninstalment of the serial story in _Home Whispers_, and, looking at\r\nhis watch he fancied that he had allowed sufficient time to elapse for\r\nevents to have matured along the lines which his imagination had\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the room seemed to him, as he entered, a little\r\nstrained. Billie looked pale and agitated. Mr. Peters looked rather\r\nagitated too. Sam caught Billie's eye. It had an unspoken appeal in it.\r\nHe gave an imperceptible nod, a reassuring nod, the nod of a man who\r\nunderstood all and was prepared to handle the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Peters,\" he said in a deep, firm, quiet voice, laying a hand on\r\nthe clerk's arm. \"It's time that you went.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, Mr. Samuel! yes, yes, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see you out,\" said Sam soothingly, and led him through the outer\r\noffice and on to the landing outside. \"Well, good luck, Peters,\" he\r\nsaid, as they stood at the head of the stairs. \"I hope you have a\r\npleasant trip. Why, what's the matter? You seem upset.\"\r\n\r\n\"That girl, Mr. Samuel! I really think--really, she cannot be quite\r\nright in her head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" said Sam firmly. \"She's all right! Well, good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Samuel.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you say you were sailing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Next Saturday, Mr. Samuel. But I fear I shall have no opportunity of\r\nseeing you again before then. I have packing to do and I have to see\r\nthis gentleman down in the country....\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Then we'll say good-bye now. Good-bye, Peters. Mind you\r\nhave a good time in America. I'll tell my father you called.\"\r\n\r\nSam watched him out of sight down the stairs, then turned and made his\r\nway back to the inner office. Billie was sitting limply on the chair\r\nwhich Jno. Peters had occupied. She sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Has he really gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's gone this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he--was he violent?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little,\" said Sam, \"a little. But I calmed him down.\" He looked at\r\nher gravely. \"Thank God I was in time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are the bravest man in the world!\" cried Billie, and, burying\r\nher face in her hands, burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"There, there!\" said Sam. \"There, there! Come come! It's all right now!\r\nThere, there, there!\"\r\n\r\nHe knelt down beside her. He slipped one arm round her waist. He patted\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\nI have tried to draw Samuel Marlowe so that he will live on the printed\r\npage. I have endeavoured to delineate his character so that it will be\r\nas an open book. And, if I have succeeded in my task, the reader will\r\nby now have become aware that he was a young man with the gall of an\r\nArmy mule. His conscience, if he had ever had one, had become atrophied\r\nthrough long disuse. He had given this sensitive girl the worst fright\r\nshe had had since a mouse had got into her bedroom at school. He had\r\ncaused Jno. Peters to totter off to the Rupert Street range making low,\r\nbleating noises. And did he care? No! All he cared about was the fact\r\nthat he had erased for ever from Billie's mind that undignified picture\r\nof himself as he had appeared on the boat, and substituted another\r\nwhich showed him brave, resourceful, gallant. All he cared about was\r\nthe fact that Billie, so cold ten minutes before, had allowed him to\r\nkiss her for the forty-second time. If you had asked him, he would have\r\nsaid that he had acted for the best, and that out of evil cometh good,\r\nor some sickening thing like that. That was the sort of man Samuel\r\nMarlowe was.\r\n\r\nHis face was very close to Billie's, who had cheered up wonderfully by\r\nthis time, and he was whispering his degraded words of endearment into\r\nher ear, when there was a sort of explosion in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Great Godfrey!\" exclaimed Mr. Rufus Bennett, gazing on the scene from\r\nthis point of vantage and mopping with a large handkerchief a scarlet\r\nface, which, as the result of climbing three flights of stairs, had\r\nbecome slightly soluble. \"Great Heavens above!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarkable as the apparition of Mr. Bennett appeared to his daughter, the\r\nexplanation of his presence at that moment in the office of Marlowe,\r\nThorpe, Prescott, Winslow, and Appleby was simple. He had woken early that\r\nmorning, and, glancing at his watch on the dressing-table, he had suddenly\r\nbecome aware of something bright and yellow beside it, and had paused,\r\ntransfixed, like Robinson Crusoe staring at the footprint in the sand.\r\nIf he had not been in England, he would have said it was a patch of\r\nsunshine. Hardly daring to hope, he pulled up the shades and looked out\r\non the garden.\r\n\r\nIt was a superb morning. It was as if some giant had uncorked a great\r\nbottle full of the distilled scent of grass, trees, flowers, and hay.\r\nMr. Bennett sniffed luxuriantly. Gone was the gloom of the past days,\r\nswept away in a great exhilaration.\r\n\r\nBreakfast had deepened his content. Henry Mortimer, softened by the\r\nsame balmy influence, had been perfectly charming. All their little\r\ndifferences had melted away in the genial warmth. And then suddenly\r\nMr. Bennett remembered that he had sent Billie up to London to enlist\r\nthe aid of the Law against his old friend, and remorse gripped him. Half\r\nan hour later he was in the train, on his way to London to intercept her\r\nand cancel her mission. He had arrived, breathless at Sir Mallaby's\r\noffice, and the first thing he had seen was his daughter in the arms of\r\na young man who was a total stranger to him. The shock took away his\r\nbreath again just as it was coming back. He advanced shakily into the\r\nroom, and supported himself with one hand on the desk, while with the\r\nother he plied the handkerchief on his super-heated face.\r\n\r\nBillie was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Why, father,\" she said, \"I didn't expect you!\"\r\n\r\nAs an explanation of her behaviour this might, no doubt, have been\r\nconsidered sufficient, but as an excuse for it Mr. Bennett thought it\r\ninadequate. He tried to convey a fatherly reproof by puffing like a\r\nseal after a long dive in search of fish.\r\n\r\n\"This is Sam,\" proceeded Billie. \"Sam Marlowe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett became aware that the young man was moving towards him with\r\noutstretched hand. It took a lot to disconcert Sam, and he was the\r\ncalmest person present. He gave evidence of this in a neat speech. He\r\ndid not in so many words congratulate Mr. Bennett on the piece of luck\r\nwhich had befallen him, but he tried to make him understand by his\r\nmanner that he was distinctly to be envied as the prospective\r\nfather-in-law of such a one as himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett stared in a frozen sort of way at the hand. He had placed\r\nSam by now. He knew that Sir Mallaby had a son. This, presumably, was\r\nhe. But the discovery did not diminish his indignation.\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to meet you, Mr. Bennett,\" said Sam. \"You could not\r\nhave come at a more fortunate moment. You see for yourself how things\r\nare. There is no need for a long explanation. You came to find a\r\ndaughter, Mr. Bennett, and you have found a son!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he would like to see the man, thought Sam, who could have put it\r\nmore cleverly and pleasantly and tactfully than that.\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Mr. Bennett, recovering breath. \"I\r\nhaven't got a son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be a son to you! I will be the prop of your declining\r\nyears....\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil do you mean, my declining years?\" demanded Mr. Bennett\r\nwith asperity.\r\n\r\n\"He means when they do decline, father dear,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" said Sam. \"When they do decline. Not till then,\r\nof course! I wouldn't dream of it. But, once they do decline, count on\r\nme! And I should like to say for my part,\" he went on handsomely, \"what\r\nan honour I think it, to become the son-in-law of a man like Mr.\r\nBennett. Bennett of New York!\" he added spaciously, not so much because\r\nhe knew what he meant, for he would have been the first to admit that\r\nhe did not, but because it sounded well.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Bennett \"You do, do you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett sat down. He put away his handkerchief, which had certainly\r\nearned a rest. Then he fastened a baleful stare upon his newly-discovered\r\nson. It was not the sort of look a proud and happy father-in-law-to-be\r\nought to have directed at a prospective relative. It was not, as a matter\r\nof fact, the sort of look which anyone ought to have directed at anybody\r\nexcept possibly an exceptionally prudish judge at a criminal in the dock,\r\nconvicted of a more than usually atrocious murder. Billie, not being in\r\nthe actual line of fire, only caught the tail end of it, but it was\r\nenough to create a misgiving.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father! You aren't angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Angry!\"\r\n\r\n\"You _can't_ be angry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't I be angry!\" demanded Mr. Bennett, with that sense of injury\r\nwhich comes to self-willed men when their whims are thwarted. \"Why the\r\ndevil shouldn't I be angry? I _am_ angry! I come here and find you\r\nlike--like this, and you seem to expect me to throw my hat in the air\r\nand give three rousing cheers! Of course I'm angry! You are engaged to\r\nbe married to an excellent young man of the highest character, one of\r\nthe finest young men I have ever met....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well!\" said Sam, straightening his tie modestly. \"Of course, if\r\nyou say so ... It's awfully good of you....\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father,\" cried Billie, \"I never really loved Bream. I like him\r\nvery much, but I could never love him. I only got engaged to him\r\nbecause you were so anxious for it, and because ... because I had\r\nquarrelled with the man I really loved ... I don't want to marry Bream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally!\" said Sam. \"Naturally! Quite out of the question. In a few\r\ndays we'll all be roaring with laughter at the very idea.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett scorched him with a look compared with which his earlier\r\neffort had been a loving glance.\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelmina,\" he said, \"go into the outer office.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father, you don't understand. You don't realise that Sam has just\r\nsaved my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saved your life? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a lunatic in here with a pistol, and Sam saved me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was nothing,\" said Sam modestly. \"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go into the outer office!\" thundered Mr. Bennett, quite unmoved by\r\nthis story.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Billie. \"I shall always love you, Sam,\" she said,\r\npausing mutinously at the door.\r\n\r\n\"I shall always love _you_,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody can keep us apart.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're wasting their time, trying,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"You're the most wonderful man in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"There never was a girl like you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get _out_!\" bellowed Mr. Bennett, on whose equanimity this\r\nlove-scene, which I think beautiful, was jarring profoundly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir!\" he said to Sam, as the door closed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let's talk it over calmly,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I will not talk it over calmly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come! You can do it if you try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bream Mortimer is the son of Henry Mortimer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Sam. \"And, while it is no doubt unfair to hold that\r\nagainst him, it's a point you can't afford to ignore. Henry Mortimer!\r\nYou and I have Henry Mortimer's number. We know what Henry Mortimer is\r\nlike! A man who spends his time thinking up ways of annoying you. You\r\ncan't seriously want to have the Mortimer family linked to you by\r\nmarriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Henry Mortimer is my oldest friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes it all the worse. Fancy a man who calls himself your friend\r\ntreating you like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"The misunderstanding to which you allude has been completely smoothed\r\nover. My relations with Mr. Mortimer are thoroughly cordial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have it your own way. Personally, I wouldn't trust a man like\r\nthat. And, as for letting my daughter marry his son...!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have decided once and for all....\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll take my advice, you will break the thing off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not take your advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't expect to charge you for it,\" explained Sam, reassuringly.\r\n\"I give it you as a friend, not as a lawyer. Six-and-eightpence to\r\nothers, free to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you understand that my daughter is going to marry Bream Mortimer?\r\nWhat are you giggling about?\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds so silly. The idea of anyone marrying Bream Mortimer, I\r\nmean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you he is a thoroughly estimable young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there you put the whole thing in a nutshell. Your daughter is a\r\ngirl of spirit. She would hate to be tied for life to an estimable\r\nyoung man.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will do as I tell her.\"\r\n\r\nSam regarded him sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no regard for her happiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the best judge of what is best for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ask me,\" said Sam candidly, \"I think you're a rotten judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not come here to be insulted!\"\r\n\r\n\"I like that! You have been insulting me ever since you arrived. What\r\nright have you to say that I'm not fit to marry your daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not say that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've implied it. And you've been looking at me as if I were a leper\r\nor something the Pure Food Committee has condemned. Why? That's what I\r\nask you,\" said Sam, warming up. This, he fancied, was the way Widgery\r\nwould have tackled a troublesome client. \"Why? Answer me that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I....\"\r\n\r\nSam rapped sharply on the desk.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, sir. Be very careful!\" He knew that this was what lawyers\r\nalways said. Of course, there is a difference in position between a\r\nmiscreant whom you suspect of an attempt at perjury and the father of\r\nthe girl you love, whose consent to the match you wish to obtain, but\r\nSam was in no mood for these nice distinctions. He only knew that\r\nlawyers told people to be very careful, so he told Mr. Bennett to be\r\nvery careful.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, be very careful?\" said Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"I'm dashed if I know,\" said Sam frankly. The question struck him as a\r\nmean attack. He wondered how Widgery would have met it. Probably by\r\nsmiling quietly and polishing his spectacles. Sam had no spectacles. He\r\nendeavoured, however, to smile quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't laugh at me!\" roared Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not laughing at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't then!\" said Mr. Bennett. He glowered at his young\r\ncompanion. \"I don't know why I'm wasting my time, talking to you. The\r\nposition is clear to the meanest intelligence. You cannot have any\r\ndifficulty in understanding it. I have no objection to you\r\npersonally....\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, this is better!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know you well enough to have any objection to you or any\r\nopinion of you at all. This is the first time I have ever met you in my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mark you,\" said Sam. \"I think I am one of those fellows who grow on\r\npeople....\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I am concerned, you simply do not exist. You may be the\r\nnoblest character in London or you may be wanted by the police. I don't\r\nknow. And I don't care. It doesn't matter to me. You mean nothing in my\r\nlife. I don't know you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must persevere,\" said Sam. \"You must buckle to and get to know me.\r\nDon't give the thing up in this half-hearted way. Everything has to\r\nhave a beginning. Stick to it, and in a week or two you will find\r\nyourself knowing me quite well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to know you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that now, but wait!\"\r\n\r\n\"And thank goodness I have not got to!\" exploded Mr. Bennett, ceasing\r\nto be calm and reasonable with a suddenness which affected Sam much as\r\nthough half a pound of gunpowder had been touched off under his chair.\r\n\"For the little I have seen of you has been quite enough! Kindly\r\nunderstand that my daughter is engaged to be married to another man, and\r\nthat I do not wish to see or hear anything of you again! I shall try to\r\nforget your very existence, and I shall see to it that Wilhelmina does\r\nthe same! You're an impudent scoundrel, sir! An impudent scoundrel! I\r\ndon't like you! I don't wish to see you again! If you were the last man\r\nin the world I wouldn't allow my daughter to marry you! If that is\r\nquite clear, I will wish you good morning!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett thundered out of the room, and Sam, temporarily stunned by\r\nthe outburst, remained where he was, gaping. A few minutes\r\nlater life began to return to his palsied limbs. It occurred to him\r\nthat Mr. Bennett had forgotten to kiss him good-bye, and he went into\r\nthe outer office to tell him so. But the outer office was empty. Sam\r\nstood for a moment in thought, then he returned to the inner office,\r\nand, picking up a time-table, began to look out trains to the village\r\nof Windlehurst in Hampshire, the nearest station to his aunt Adeline's\r\ncharming old-world house, Windles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I read over the last few chapters of this narrative, I see that I\r\nhave been giving the reader a rather too jumpy time. To almost a\r\npainful degree I have excited his pity and terror; and, though that is\r\nwhat Aristotle tells one ought to do, I feel that a little respite\r\nwould not be out of order. The reader can stand having his emotions\r\nchurned up to a certain point; after that he wants to take it easy. It\r\nis with pleasure, therefore, that I turn now to depict a quiet,\r\npeaceful scene in domestic life. It won't last long--three minutes,\r\nperhaps, by a stop-watch--but that is not my fault. My task is to\r\nrecord facts as they happened.\r\n\r\nThe morning sunlight fell pleasantly on the garden of Windles, turning\r\nit into the green and amber Paradise which Nature had intended it to\r\nbe. A number of the local birds sang melodiously in the under-growth at\r\nthe end of the lawn, while others, more energetic, hopped about the\r\ngrass in quest of worms. Bees, mercifully ignorant that, after\r\nthey had worked themselves to the bone gathering honey, the\r\nproceeds of their labour would be collared and consumed by idle humans,\r\nbuzzed industriously to and fro and dived head foremost into flowers.\r\nWinged insects danced sarabands in the sunshine. And in a deck-chair\r\nunder the cedar-tree Billie Bennett, with a sketching-block on her\r\nknee, was engaged in drawing a picture of the ruined castle. Beside\r\nher, curled up in a ball, lay her Pekinese dog, Pinky-Boodles. Beside\r\nPinky-Boodles slept Smith, the bulldog. In the distant stable-yard,\r\nunseen but audible, a boy in shirt sleeves was washing the car and\r\nsinging as much as treacherous memory would permit of a popular\r\nsentimental ballad.\r\n\r\nYou may think that was all. You may suppose that nothing could be added\r\nto deepen the atmosphere of peace and content. Not so. At this moment,\r\nMr. Bennett emerged from the French windows of the drawing-room, clad\r\nin white flannels and buckskin shoes, supplying just the finishing\r\ntouch that was needed.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett crossed the lawn, and sat down beside his daughter. Smith,\r\nthe bull-dog, raising a sleepy head, breathed heavily; but Mr. Bennett\r\ndid not quail. Of late, relations of distant but solid friendship had\r\ncome to exist between them. Sceptical at first, Mr. Bennett had at\r\nlength allowed himself to be persuaded of the mildness of the animal's\r\nnature and the essential purity of his motives; and now it was only when\r\nthey encountered each other unexpectedly round sharp corners that he\r\never betrayed the slightest alarm. So now, while Smith slept on the grass,\r\nMr. Bennett reclined in the chair. It was the nearest thing modern\r\ncivilization had seen to the lion lying down with the lamb.\r\n\r\n\"Sketching?\" said Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Billie, for there were no secrets between this girl and her\r\nfather. At least, not many. She occasionally omitted to tell him some\r\nsuch trifle as that she had met Samuel Marlowe on the previous morning\r\nin a leafy lane, and intended to meet him again this afternoon, but\r\napart from that her mind was an open book.\r\n\r\n\"It's a great morning,\" said Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"So peaceful,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"The eggs you get in the country in England,\" said Mr. Bennett,\r\nsuddenly striking a lyrical note, \"are extraordinary. I had three for\r\nbreakfast this morning which defied competition, simply defied\r\ncompetition. They were large and brown, and as fresh as new-mown-hay!\"\r\n\r\nHe mused for a while in a sort of ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\"And the hams!\" he went on. \"The ham I had for breakfast was what I\r\ncall ham! I don't know when I've had ham like that. I suppose it's\r\nsomething they feed the pigs,\" he concluded, in soft meditation. And he\r\ngave a little sigh. Life was very beautiful.\r\n\r\nSilence fell, broken only by the snoring of Smith. Billie was thinking\r\nof Sam, and of what Sam had said to her in the lane yesterday; of his\r\nclean-cut face, and the look in his eyes--so vastly superior to any\r\nlook that ever came into the eyes of Bream Mortimer. She was telling\r\nherself that her relations with Sam were an idyll; for, being young and\r\nromantic, she enjoyed this freshet of surreptitious meetings which had\r\ncome to enliven the stream of her life. It was pleasant to go warily\r\ninto deep lanes where forbidden love lurked. She cast a swift side-glance\r\nat her father--the unconscious ogre in her fairy-story. What would he say\r\nif he knew? But Mr. Bennett did not know, and consequently continued to\r\nmeditate peacefully on ham.\r\n\r\nThey had sat like this for perhaps a minute--two happy mortals lulled by\r\nthe gentle beauty of the day--when from the window of the drawing-room\r\nthere stepped out a white-capped maid. And one may just as well say at\r\nonce--and have done with it--that this is the point where the quiet,\r\npeaceful scene in domestic life terminates with a jerk, and pity and\r\nterror resume work at the old stand.\r\n\r\nThe maid--her name, not that it matters, was Susan, and she was engaged\r\nto be married, though the point is of no importance, to the second\r\n assistant at Green's Grocery Stores in Windlehurst--approached Mr.\r\nBennett.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, a gentleman to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\" said Mr. Bennett, torn from a dream of large pink slices edged\r\nwith bread-crumbed fat. \"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman to see you, sir. In the drawing-room. He says you are\r\nexpecting him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, yes. To be sure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett heaved himself out of the deck-chair. Beyond the French\r\nwindows he could see an indistinct form in a gray suit, and remembered\r\nthat this was the morning on which Sir Mallaby Marlowe's clerk--who was\r\ntaking those Schultz and Bowen papers for him to America--had\r\nwritten that he would call. To-day was Friday; no doubt the man was\r\nsailing from Southampton to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the lawn, entered the drawing-room, and found Mr. Jno.\r\nPeters with an expression on his ill-favored face, which looked like\r\none of consternation, of uneasiness, even of alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, Mr. Peters,\" said Mr. Bennett. \"Very good of you to run down.\r\nTake a seat, and I'll just go through the few notes I have made about\r\nthe matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bennett,\" exclaimed Jno. Peters. \"May--may I speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Eh? What? Something to say? What is it?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Peters cleared his throat awkwardly. He was feeling embarrassed at\r\nthe unpleasantness of the duty which he had to perform, but it was a\r\nduty, and he did not intend to shrink from performing it. Ever since,\r\ngazing appreciatively through the drawing-room windows at the charming\r\nscene outside, he had caught sight of the unforgettable form of Billie,\r\nseated in her chair with the sketching-block on her knee, he had\r\nrealised that he could not go away in silence, leaving Mr. Bennett\r\nignorant of what he was up against.\r\n\r\nOne almost inclines to fancy that there must have been a curse of some\r\nkind on this house of Windles. Certainly everybody who entered it\r\nseemed to leave his peace of mind behind him. Jno. Peters had been\r\nfeeling notably happy during his journey in the train from London, and\r\nthe subsequent walk from the station. The splendor of the morning had\r\nsoothed his nerves, and the faint wind that blew inshore from the sea\r\nspoke to him hearteningly of adventure and romance. There was a jar of\r\npot-pourri on the drawing-room table, and he had derived considerable\r\npleasure from sniffing at it. In short, Jno. Peters was in the pink,\r\nwithout a care in the world, until he had looked out of the window and\r\nseen Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bennett,\" he said, \"I don't want to do anybody any harm, and, if\r\nyou know all about it, and she suits you, well and good; but I think it\r\nis my duty to inform you that your stenographer is not quite right in\r\nthe head. I don't say she's dangerous, but she isn't compos. She\r\ndecidedly is _not_ compos, Mr. Bennett!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett stared at his well-wisher dumbly for a moment. The thought\r\ncrossed his mind that, if ever there was a case of the pot calling the\r\nkettle black, this was it. His opinion of Jno. Peters' sanity went down\r\nto zero.\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about? My stenographer? What stenographer?\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Mr. Peters that a man of the other's wealth and business\r\nconnections might well have a troupe of these useful females. He\r\nparticularised.\r\n\r\n\"I mean the young lady out in the garden there, to whom you were\r\ndictating just now. The young lady with the writing-pad on her knee.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! What!\" Mr. Bennett spluttered. \"Do you know who that is?\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, indeed!\" said Jno. Peters. \"I have only met her once, when\r\nshe came into our office to see Mr. Samuel, but her personality and\r\nappearance stamped themselves so forcibly on my mind, that I know I am\r\nnot mistaken. I am sure it is my duty to tell you exactly what happened\r\nwhen I was left alone with her in the office. We had hardly exchanged a\r\ndozen words, Mr. Bennett, when--\" here Jno. Peters, modest to the core,\r\nturned vividly pink, \"when she told me--she told me that I was the only\r\nman she loved!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett uttered a loud cry.\r\n\r\n\"Sweet spirits of nitre!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Peters could make nothing of this exclamation, and he was deterred\r\nfrom seeking light, by the sudden action of his host, who, bounding\r\nfrom his seat, with a vivacity of which one could not have believed him\r\ncapable, charged to the French window and emitted a bellow.\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelmina!\"\r\n\r\nBillie looked up from her sketching-book with a start. It seemed to her\r\nthat there was a note of anguish, of panic, in that voice. What her\r\nfather could have found in the drawing-room to be frightened at, she\r\ndid not know; but she dropped her block and hurried to his assistance.\r\n\r\n\"What it is, father?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett had retired within the room when she arrived; and, going in\r\nafter him, she perceived at once what had caused his alarm. There\r\nbefore her, looking more sinister than ever, stood the lunatic Peters;\r\nand there was an ominous bulge in his right coat-pocket which betrayed\r\nthe presence of the revolver. What Jno. Peters was, as a matter of\r\nfact, carrying in his right coat-pocket was a bag of mixed chocolates\r\nwhich he had purchased in Windlehurst. But Billie's eyes,\r\nthough bright, had no X-ray quality. Her simple creed was that, if Jno.\r\nPeters bulged at any point, that bulge must be caused by a pistol. She\r\nscreamed, and backed against the wall. Her whole acquaintance with Jno.\r\nPeters had been on constant backing against walls.\r\n\r\n\"Don't shoot!\" she cried, as Mr. Peters absent-mindedly dipped his\r\nhand into the pocket of his coat. \"Oh, please don't shoot!\"\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce do you mean?\" said Mr. Bennett, irritably.\r\n\r\nHe hated to have people gibbering around him in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelmina, this man says that you told him you loved him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did, and I do. Really, really, Mr. Peters, I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suffering cats!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett clutched at the back of a chair.\r\n\r\n\"But you've only met him once!\" he added almost pleadingly.\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand, father dear,\" said Billie desperately. \"I'll\r\nexplain the whole thing later, when....\"\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" ejaculated Jno. Peters feebly. \"Did you say 'father'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I said 'father'!\"\r\n\r\n\"This is my daughter, Mr. Peters.\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter! I mean, your daughter! Are--are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'm sure. Do you think I don't know my own daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"But she called me 'Mr. Peters'!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's your name, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, if she--if this young lady is your daughter, how did she know my\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\nThe point seemed to strike Mr. Bennett. He turned to Billie.\r\n\r\n\"That's true. Tell me, Wilhelmina, when did you and Mr. Peters meet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, in--in Sir Mallaby Marlowe's office, the morning you came there\r\nand found me when I was--talking to Sam.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Peters uttered a subdued gargling sound. He was finding this scene\r\noppressive to a not very robust intellect.\r\n\r\n\"He--Mr. Samuel--told me your name, Miss Milliken,\" he said dully.\r\n\r\nBillie stared at him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Marlowe told you my name was Miss Milliken!\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"He told me that you were the sister of the Miss Milliken who acts as\r\nstenographer for the guv'--for Sir Mallaby, and sent me in to show you\r\nmy revolver, because he said you were interested and wanted to see it.\"\r\n\r\nBillie uttered an exclamation. So did Mr. Bennett, who hated mysteries.\r\n\r\n\"What revolver? Which revolver? What's all this about a revolver? Have\r\nyou a revolver?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, Mr. Bennett. It is packed now in my trunk, but usually I\r\ncarry it about with me everywhere in order to take a little practice at\r\nthe Rupert Street range. I bought it when Sir Mallaby told me he was\r\nsending me to America, because I thought I ought to be prepared--because\r\nof the Underworld, you know.\"\r\n\r\nA cold gleam had come into Billie's eyes. Her face was pale and hard.\r\nIf Sam Marlowe--at that moment carolling blithely in his bedroom at the\r\nBlue Boar in Windlehurst, washing his hands preparatory to descending\r\nto the coffee-room for a bit of cold lunch--could have seen her, the\r\nsong would have frozen on his lips. Which, one might mention, as\r\nshowing that there is always a bright side, would have been much\r\nappreciated by the travelling gentleman in the adjoining room, who had\r\nhad a wild night with some other travelling gentlemen, and was then\r\nnursing a rather severe headache, separated from Sam's penetrating\r\nbaritone, only by the thickness of a wooden wall.\r\n\r\nBillie knew all. And, terrible though the fact is as an indictment of\r\nthe male sex, when a woman knows all, there is invariably trouble ahead\r\nfor some man.\r\n\r\nThere was trouble ahead for Sam Marlowe. Billie, now in possession of\r\nthe facts, had examined them and come to the conclusion that Sam had\r\nplayed a practical joke on her, and she was a girl who strongly\r\ndisapproved of practical humor at her expense.\r\n\r\n\"That morning I met you at Sir Mallaby's office, Mr. Peters,\" she said\r\nin a frosty voice, \"Mr. Marlowe had just finished telling me a long and\r\nconvincing story to the effect that you were madly in love with a Miss\r\nMilliken, who had jilted you, and that this had driven you off your\r\nhead, and that you spent your time going about with a pistol, trying to\r\nshoot every red-haired woman you saw, because you thought they were\r\nMiss Milliken. Naturally, when you came in and called me Miss Milliken,\r\nand brandished a revolver, I was very frightened. I thought it would be\r\nuseless to tell you that I wasn't Miss Milliken, so I tried to persuade\r\nyou that I was, and hadn't jilted you after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" said Mr. Peters, vastly relieved; and yet--for always\r\nthere is bitter mixed with the sweet--a shade disappointed. \"Then--er--you\r\ndon't love me after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Billie. \"I am engaged to Bream Mortimer, and I love him and\r\nnobody else in the world!\"\r\n\r\nThe last portion of her observation was intended for the consumption of\r\nMr. Bennett, rather than that of Mr. Peters, and he consumed it\r\njoyfully. He folded Billie in his ample embrace.\r\n\r\n\"I always thought you had a grain of sense hidden away somewhere,\" he\r\nsaid, paying her a striking tribute. \"I hope now that we've heard the\r\nlast of all this foolishness about that young hound Marlowe.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly have! I don't want ever to see him again! I hate him!\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't do better, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennett, approvingly. \"And\r\nnow run away. Mr. Peters and I have some business to discuss.\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, Webster, the valet, sunning himself in the\r\nstable-yard, was aware of the daughter of his employer approaching him.\r\n\r\n\"Webster,\" said Billie. She was still pale. Her face was still hard,\r\nand her eyes still gleamed coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Miss?\" said Webster politely, throwing away the cigarette with which\r\nhe had been refreshing himself.\r\n\r\n\"Will you do something for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be more than delighted, miss.\"\r\n\r\nBillie whisked into view an envelope which had been concealed in the\r\nrecesses of her dress.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the country about here, well, Webster?\"\r\n\r\n\"Within a certain radius, not unintimately, Miss. I have been for\r\nseveral enjoyable rambles since the fine weather set in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the place where there is a road leading to Havant, and\r\nanother to Cosham? It's about a mile down....\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the spot well, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, straight in front of you when you get to the sign-post there is\r\na little lane....\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, miss,\" said Webster. \"A delightfully romantic spot. What\r\nwith the overhanging trees, the wealth of blackberry bushes, the varied\r\nwild-flowers....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, never mind about the wild-flowers now. I want you after lunch to\r\ntake this note to a gentleman you will find sitting on the gate at the\r\nbottom of the lane....\"\r\n\r\n\"Sitting on the gate, miss. Yes, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or leaning against it. You can't mistake him. He is rather tall and....\r\nOh, well, there isn't likely to be anybody else there, so you can't\r\nmake a mistake. Give him this, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, miss. Er--any message?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any verbal message, miss?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly not! You won't forget, will you, Webster?\"\r\n\r\n\"On no account whatever, miss. Shall I wait for an answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be any answer,\" said Billie, setting her teeth for an\r\ninstant. \"Oh, Webster!\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can rely on you to say nothing to anybody?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most undoubtedly, miss. Most undoubtedly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Does anybody know anything about a feller named S. Marlowe?\" enquired\r\nWebster, entering the kitchen. \"Don't all speak at once! S. Marlowe.\r\nEver heard of him?\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a reply, but nobody had any information to impart.\r\n\r\n\"Because there's something jolly well up! Our Miss B. is sending me\r\nwith notes for him to the bottom of lanes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And her engaged to young Mr. Mortimer!\" said the scullery-maid\r\nshocked. \"The way they go on! Chronic!\" said the scullery-maid.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you go getting alarmed. And don't you,\" added Webster, \"go\r\nshoving your ear in when your social superiors are talking. I've had to\r\nspeak to you about that before. My remarks were addressed to Mrs.\r\nWithers here.\"\r\n\r\nHe indicated the cook with a respectful gesture.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here's the note, Mrs. Withers. Of course, if you had a steamy\r\nkettle handy, in about half a moment we could ... but no, perhaps, it's\r\nwiser not to risk it. And, come to that, I don't need to unstick the\r\nenvelope to know what's inside here. It's the raspberry, ma'am, or I've\r\nlost all my power to read the human female countenance. Very cold and\r\nproud-looking she was! I don't know who this S. Marlowe is, but I do\r\nknow one thing; in this hand I hold the instrument that's going to give\r\nit him in the neck, proper! Right in the neck, or my name isn't Montagu\r\nWebster!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Withers comfortably, pausing for a moment from her\r\nlabours. \"Think of that!\"\r\n\r\n\"The way I look at it,\" said Webster, \"is that there's been some sort\r\nof understanding between our Miss B. and this S. Marlowe, and she's\r\nthought better of it and decided to stick to the man of her parent's\r\nchoice. She's chosen wealth and made up her mind to hand the humble\r\nsuitor the mitten. There was a rather similar situation in 'Cupid or\r\nMammon,' that Nosegay Novelette I was reading in the train coming down\r\nhere, only that ended different. For my part I'd be better pleased if\r\nour Miss B. would let the cash go, and obey the dictates of her own\r\nheart; but these modern girls are all alike. All out for the stuff,\r\nthey are! Oh, well, it's none of my affair,\" said Webster, stifling a\r\nnot unmanly sigh. For beneath that immaculate shirt-front there beat a\r\nwarm heart. Montagu Webster was a sentimentalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nA half-past two that afternoon, full of optimism and cold beef, gaily\r\nunconscious that Webster, with measured strides was approaching ever\r\nnearer with the note that was to give it him in the neck, proper,\r\nSamuel Marlowe dangled his feet from the top bar of the gate at the end\r\nof the lane and smoked contentedly as he waited for Billie to make her\r\nappearance. He had had an excellent lunch; his pipe was drawing well,\r\nand all Nature smiled. The breeze from the sea across the meadows,\r\ntickled pleasantly the back of his head, and sang a soothing song in\r\nthe long grass and ragged-robins at his feet. He was looking forward\r\nwith a roseate glow of anticipation to the moment when the white\r\nflutter of Billie's dress would break the green of the foreground. How\r\neagerly he would jump from the gate! How lovingly he would....\r\n\r\nThe elegant figure of Webster interrupted his reverie. Sam had never\r\nseen Webster before, and it was with no pleasure that he saw him now. He\r\nhad come to regard this lane as his own property, and he resented\r\ntrespassers. He tucked his legs under him, and scowled at Webster under\r\nthe brim of his hat.\r\n\r\nThe valet advanced towards him with the air of an affable executioner\r\nstepping daintily to the block.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Marlowe, sir?\" he enquired politely.\r\n\r\nSam was startled. He could make nothing of this.\r\n\r\n\"Eh? What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. S. Marlowe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine is Webster, sir, I am Mr. Bennett's personal gentleman's\r\ngentleman. Miss Bennett entrusted me with this note to deliver to you,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nSam began to grasp the situation. For some reason or other, the dear\r\ngirl had been prevented from coming this afternoon, and she had written\r\nto explain and to relieve his anxiety. It was like her. It was just the\r\nsweet, thoughtful thing he would have expected her to do. His\r\ncontentment with the existing scheme of things returned. The sun\r\nshone out again, and he found himself amiably disposed towards the\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\n\"Fine day,\" he said, as he took the note.\r\n\r\n\"Extremely, sir,\" said Webster, outwardly unemotional, inwardly full of\r\na grave pity.\r\n\r\nIt was plain to him that there had been no previous little rift to\r\nprepare the young man for the cervical operation which awaited him, and\r\nhe edged a little nearer, in order to be handy to catch Sam if the\r\nshock knocked him off the gate.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, it did not. Having read the opening words of the note,\r\nSam rocked violently; but his feet were twined about the lower bars and\r\nthis saved him from overbalancing. Webster stepped back, relieved.\r\n\r\nThe note fluttered to the ground. Webster, picking it up and handing it\r\nback, was enabled to get a glimpse of the first two sentences. They\r\nconfirmed his suspicions. The note was hot stuff. Assuming that it\r\ncontinued as it began, it was about the warmest thing of its kind that\r\npen had ever written. Webster had received one or two heated epistles\r\nfrom the sex in his time--your man of gallantry can hardly hope to\r\nescape these unpleasantnesses--but none had got off the mark\r\nquite so swiftly, and with quite so much frigid violence as this.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Sam, mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir. You are very welcome.\"\r\n\r\nSam resumed his reading. A cold perspiration broke out on his forehead.\r\nHis toes curled, and something seemed to be crawling down the small of\r\nhis back. His heart had moved from its proper place and was now beating\r\nin his throat. He swallowed once or twice to remove the obstruction,\r\nbut without success. A kind of pall had descended on the landscape,\r\nblotting out the sun.\r\n\r\nOf all the rotten sensations in this world, the worst is the\r\nrealisation that a thousand-to-one chance has come off, and caused our\r\nwrong-doing to be detected. There had seemed no possibility of that\r\nlittle ruse of his being discovered, and yet here was Billie in full\r\npossession of the facts. It almost made the thing worse that she did\r\nnot say how she had come into possession of them. This gave Sam that\r\nfeeling of self-pity, that sense of having been ill-used by Fate, which\r\nmakes the bringing home of crime so particularly poignant.\r\n\r\n\"Fine day!\" he muttered. He had a sort of subconscious feeling that it\r\nwas imperative to keep engaging Webster in light conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Weather still keeps up,\" agreed the valet suavely.\r\n\r\nSam frowned over the note. He felt injured. Sending a fellow notes\r\ndidn't give him a chance. If she had come in person and denounced him\r\nit would not have been an agreeable experience, but at least it would\r\nhave been possible then to have pleaded and cajoled and--and all that\r\nsort of thing. But what could he do now? It seemed to him that his only\r\npossible course was to write a note in reply, begging her to see him.\r\nHe explored his pockets and found a pencil and a scrap of paper. For\r\nsome moments he scribbled desperately. Then he folded the note.\r\n\r\n\"Will you take this to Miss Bennett,\" he said, holding it out.\r\n\r\nWebster took the missive, because he wanted to read it later at his\r\nleisure; but he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Useless, I fear, sir,\" he said gravely.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid it would effect little or nothing, sir, sending our Miss\r\nB. notes. She is not in the proper frame of mind to appreciate them. I saw\r\nher face when she handed me the letter you have just read, and I assure\r\nyou, sir, she is not in a malleable mood.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to know a lot about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have studied the sex, sir,\" said Webster modestly.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, about my business, confound it! You seem to know all about\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, sir, I think I may say that I have grasped the position of\r\naffairs. And, if you will permit me to say so, sir, you have my\r\nrespectful sympathy.\"\r\n\r\nDignity is a sensitive plant which flourishes only under the fairest\r\nconditions. Sam's had perished in the bleak east wind of Billie's note.\r\nIn other circumstances he might have resented this intrusion of a\r\nstranger into his most intimate concerns. His only emotion now, was one\r\nof dull but distinct gratitude. The four winds of heaven blew chilly\r\nupon his raw and unprotected soul, and he wanted to wrap it up in a\r\nmantle of sympathy, careless of the source from which he borrowed that\r\nmantle. If Webster, the valet, felt disposed, as he seemed to indicate,\r\nto comfort him, let the thing go on. At that moment Sam would have\r\naccepted condolences from a coal-heaver.\r\n\r\n\"I was reading a story--one of the Nosegay Novelettes; I do not know if\r\nyou are familiar with the series, sir?--in which much the same\r\nsituation occurred. It was entitled 'Cupid or Mammon!' The heroine,\r\nLady Blanche Trefusis, forced by her parents to wed a wealthy suitor,\r\ndespatches a note to her humble lover, informing him it cannot be. I\r\nbelieve it often happens like that, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're all wrong,\" said Sam. \"It's not that at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir? I supposed it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing like it! I--I--\"\r\n\r\nSam's dignity, on its death-bed, made a last effort to assert itself.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what it's got to do with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, sir!\" said Webster, with dignity. \"Just as you say! Good\r\nafternoon, sir!\"\r\n\r\nHe swayed gracefully, conveying a suggestion of departure without\r\nmoving his feet. The action was enough for Sam. Dignity gave an\r\nexpiring gurgle, and passed away, regretted by all.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe idea of being alone in this infernal lane, without human support,\r\noverpowered him. Moreover, Webster had personality. He exuded it.\r\nAlready Sam had begun to cling to him in spirit, and rely on his\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, if you do not wish it, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWebster coughed gently, to show his appreciation of the delicate nature\r\nof the conversation. He was consumed with curiosity, and his threatened\r\ndeparture had been but a pretence. A team of horses could not have\r\nmoved Webster at that moment.\r\n\r\n\"Might I ask, then what...?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's been a misunderstanding,\" said Sam. \"At least, there was, but\r\nnow there isn't, if you see what I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear I have not quite grasped your meaning, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I--I--played a sort of--you might almost call it a sort of trick\r\non Miss Bennett. With the best motives, of course!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"And she's found out. I don't know how she's found out, but she has. So\r\nthere you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what nature would the trick be, sir? A species of ruse, sir,--some\r\nkind of innocent deception?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was like this.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a complicated story to tell, and Sam, a prey to conflicting\r\nemotions, told it badly; but such was the almost superhuman\r\nintelligence of Webster, that he succeeded in grasping the salient\r\npoints. Indeed, he said that it reminded him of something of much the\r\nsame kind in the Nosegay Novelette, \"All for Her,\" where the hero,\r\nanxious to win the esteem of the lady of his heart, had bribed a tramp\r\nto simulate an attack upon her in a lonely road.\r\n\r\n\"The principle's the same,\" said Webster.\r\n\r\n\"Well what did he do when she found out?\"\r\n\r\n\"She did not find out, sir. All ended happily, and never had the\r\nwedding-bells in the old village church rung out a blither peal than\r\nthey did at the subsequent union.\"\r\n\r\nSam was thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"Bribed a tramp to attack her, did he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. She had never thought much of him till that moment, sir.\r\nVery cold and haughty she had been, his social status being\r\nconsiderably inferior to her own. But, when she cried for help, and he\r\ndashed out from behind a hedge, well, it made all the difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder where I could get a good tramp,\" said Sam, meditatively.\r\n\r\nWebster shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I really would hardly recommend such a procedure, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it would be difficult to make a tramp understand what you wanted.\"\r\n\r\nSam brightened.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it! _You_ pretend to attack her, and I'll....\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't, sir! I couldn't really! I should jeopardise my situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come! Be a man!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I fear not. There's a difference between handing in your\r\nresignation--I was compelled to do that only recently, owing to a few\r\nwords I had with the guv'nor, though subsequently prevailed upon to\r\nwithdraw it--I say there's a difference between handing in your\r\nresignation and being given the sack, and that's what would\r\nhappen--without a character, what's more, and lucky if it didn't mean\r\na prison cell. No, sir; I could not contemplate such a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I don't see that there's anything to be done,\" said Sam morosely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shouldn't say that, sir,\" said Webster, encouragingly. \"It's\r\nsimply a matter of finding the way. The problem confronting us--you,\r\nI should say....\"\r\n\r\n\"Us,\" said Sam. \"Most decidedly us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much, sir. I would not have presumed, but if you say\r\nso--The problem confronting us, as I envisage it, resolves itself into\r\nthis. You have offended our Miss B. and she has expressed a\r\ndisinclination ever to see you again. How, then, is it possible, in\r\nspite of her attitude, to recapture her esteem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"There are several methods which occur to one....\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't occur to _me!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, for example, you might rescue her from a burning building as in\r\n'True As Steel'....\"\r\n\r\n\"Set fire to the house, eh?\" said Sam, reflectively. \"Yes, there might\r\nbe something in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would hardly advise such a thing,\" said Webster, a little\r\nhastily--flattered at the readiness with which his disciple was taking\r\nhis advice, yet acutely alive to the fact that he slept at the top of\r\nthe house himself.\r\n\r\n\"A little drastic, if I may say so. It might be better to save her from\r\ndrowning, as in 'The Earl's Secret'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but where could she drown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is a lake in the grounds....\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\" said Sam. \"Terrific! I knew I could rely on you. Say no\r\nmore! The whole thing's settled. You take her out rowing on the lake,\r\nand upset the boat. I plunge in ... I suppose you can swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh? Well, never mind. You'll manage somehow, I expect. Cling to the\r\nupturned boat or something, I shouldn't wonder. There's always a way.\r\nYes, that's the plan. When is the earliest you could arrange this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear such a course must be considered out of the question, sir. It\r\nreally wouldn't do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't see a flaw in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in the first place, it would certainly jeopardise my\r\nsituation....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hang your situation! You talk as if you were Prime Minister or\r\nsomething. You can easily get another situation. A valuable man like\r\nyou,\" said Sam, ingratiatingly.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Webster firmly. \"From boyhood up I've always had a\r\nregular horror of the water. I can't so much as go paddling without an\r\nuneasy feeling.\"\r\n\r\nThe image of Webster paddling was arresting enough to occupy Sam's\r\nthoughts for a moment. It was an inspiring picture, and for an instant\r\nuplifted his spirits. Then they fell again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't see what there _is_ to be done,\" he said, gloomily.\r\n\"It's no good making suggestions, if you have some frivolous objection\r\nto all of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My idea,\" said Webster, \"would be something which did not involve my\r\nown personal and active co-operation, sir. If it is all the same to\r\nyou, I should prefer to limit my assistance to advice. I am anxious to\r\nhelp, but I am a man of regular habits, which I do not wish to disturb.\r\nDid you ever read 'Footpaths of Fate,' in the Nosegay series, sir? I've\r\nonly just remembered it, and it contains the most helpful suggestion of\r\nthe lot. There had been a misunderstanding between the heroine and the\r\nhero--their names have slipped my mind, though I fancy his was Cyril--and\r\nshe had told him to hop it....\"\r\n\r\n\"To what?\"\r\n\r\n\"To leave her for ever, sir. And what do you think he did?\"\r\n\r\n\"How the deuce do I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"He kidnapped her little brother, sir, to whom she was devoted, kept him\r\nhidden for a bit, and then returned him, and in her gratitude all was\r\nforgotten and forgiven, and never....\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Never had the bells of the old village church....\"\r\n\r\n\"Rung out a blither peal. Exactly, sir. Well, there, if you will allow\r\nme to say so, you are, sir! You need seek no further for a plan of\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Bennett hasn't got a little brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. But she has a dog, and is greatly attached to it.\"\r\n\r\nSam stared. From the expression on his face it was evident that Webster\r\nimagined himself to have made a suggestion of exceptional intelligence.\r\nIt struck Sam as the silliest he had ever heard.\r\n\r\n\"You mean I ought to steal her dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, good heavens! Have you seen that dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"The one to which I allude is a small brown animal with a fluffy tail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and a bark like a steam siren, and, in addition to that, about\r\neighty-five teeth, all sharper than razors. I couldn't get within ten\r\nfeet of that dog without its lifting the roof off, and, if I did, it\r\nwould chew me into small pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had anticipated that difficulty, sir. In 'Footpaths of Fate' there\r\nwas a nurse who assisted the hero by drugging the child.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" said Sam, impressed.\r\n\r\n\"He rewarded her,\" said Webster, allowing his gaze to stray\r\nnonchalantly over the country-side, \"liberally, very liberally.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean that you expect me to reward you if you drug the dog,\"\r\nsaid Sam, \"don't worry. Let me bring this thing off, and you can have\r\nall I've got, and my cuff-links as well. Come, now, this is really\r\nbeginning to look like something. Speak to me more of this matter.\r\nWhere do we go from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, what's the next step in the scheme? Oh, Lord!\" Sam's face\r\nfell. The light of hope died out of his eyes. \"It's all off! It can't\r\nbe done! How could I possibly get into the house? I take it that the\r\nlittle brute sleeps in the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"That need constitute no obstacle, sir; no obstacle at all. The animal\r\nsleeps in a basket in the hall.... Perhaps you are familiar with the\r\ninterior of the house, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't been inside it since I was at school. I'm Mr. Hignett's\r\ncousin, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir? I wasn't aware. Mr. Hignett sprained his ankle this\r\nmorning, poor gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he?\" said Sam, not particularly interested. \"I used to stay with\r\nhim,\" he went on, \"during the holidays sometimes, but I've practically\r\nforgotten what the place is like inside. I remember the hall vaguely.\r\nFireplace at one side, one or two suits of armour standing about, a\r\nsort of window-ledge near the front door..\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, sir. It is close beside that window-ledge that the animal's\r\nbasket is situated. If I administer a slight soporific....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you haven't explained yet how I am to get into the house in\r\nthe first place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite easily, sir. I can admit you through the drawing-room windows\r\nwhile dinner is in progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can then secrete yourself in the cupboard in the drawing-room.\r\nPerhaps you recollect the cupboard to which I refer, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't remember any cupboard. As a matter of fact, when I used to\r\nstay at the house the drawing-room was barred.... Mrs. Hignett wouldn't\r\nlet us inside it for fear we should smash her china. Is there a\r\ncupboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Immediately behind the piano, sir. A nice, roomy cupboard. I was\r\nglancing into it myself in a spirit of idle curiosity only the other\r\nday. It contains nothing except a few knick-knacks on an upper shelf.\r\nYou could lock yourself in from the interior, and be quite comfortably\r\nseated on the floor till the household retired to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"When would that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"They retire quite early, sir, as a rule. By half-past ten the coast is\r\ngenerally clear. At that time I would suggest that I came down and\r\nknocked on the cupboard door to notify you that all was well.\"\r\n\r\nSam was glowing with frank approval.\r\n\r\n\"You know, you're a master-mind!\" he said, enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"You're very kind, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the lads, by Jove!\" said Sam. \"And not the worst of them! I\r\ndon't want to flatter you, but there's a future for you in crime, if\r\nyou cared to go in for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that you appreciate my poor efforts, sir. Then we will\r\nregard the scheme as passed and approved?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say we would! It's a bird!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be round at about a quarter to eight. Will that be right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Admirable, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, I say, about that soporific.... Don't overdo it. Don't go killing\r\nthe little beast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Sam, \"you can't say it's not a temptation. And you know\r\nwhat you Napoleons of the Underworld are!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing more than another which weighs upon the mind of a\r\nstory-teller as he chronicles the events which he has set out to\r\ndescribe, it is the thought that the reader may be growing impatient\r\nwith him for straying from the main channel of his tale and devoting\r\nhimself to what are after all minor developments. This story, for\r\ninstance, opened with Mrs. Horace Hignett, the world-famous writer on\r\nTheosophy, going over to America to begin a lecture-tour; and no one\r\nrealises more keenly than I do that I have left Mrs. Hignett flat. I\r\nhave thrust that great thinker into the background and concentrated my\r\nattention on the affairs of one who is both her mental and moral\r\ninferior, Samuel Marlowe. I seem at this point to see the reader--a\r\ngreat brute of a fellow with beetling eyebrows and a jaw like the ram\r\nof a battleship, the sort of fellow who is full of determination and will\r\nstand no nonsense--rising to remark that he doesn't care what happened\r\nto Samuel Marlowe and that what he wants to know is, how Mrs. Hignett\r\nmade out on her lecturing-tour. Did she go big in Buffalo? Did she have\r\n'em tearing up the seats in Schenectady? Was she a riot in Chicago and\r\na cyclone in St. Louis? Those are the points on which he desires\r\ninformation, or give him his money back.\r\n\r\nI cannot supply the information. And, before you condemn me, let me\r\nhastily add that the fault is not mine but that of Mrs. Hignett\r\nherself. The fact is, she never went to Buffalo. Schenectady saw\r\nnothing of her. She did not get within a thousand miles of Chicago, nor\r\ndid she penetrate to St. Louis. For the very morning after her son\r\nEustace sailed for England in the liner _Atlantic_, she happened\r\nto read in the paper one of those abridged passenger-lists which the\r\njournals of New York are in the habit of printing, and got a nasty\r\nshock when she saw that, among those whose society Eustace would enjoy\r\nduring the voyage was Miss Wilhelmina Bennett, daughter of J. Rufus\r\nBennett, of Bennett, Mandelbaum and Co. And within five minutes of\r\ndigesting this information, she was at her desk writing out\r\ntelegrams cancelling all her engagements. Iron-souled as this woman\r\nwas, her fingers trembled as she wrote. She had a vision of Eustace and\r\nthe daughter of J. Rufus Bennett strolling together on moonlit decks,\r\nleaning over rails damp with sea-spray, and, in short, generally\r\nstarting the whole trouble over again.\r\n\r\nIn the height of the tourist season it is not always possible for one\r\nwho wishes to leave America to spring on to the next boat. A long\r\nmorning's telephoning to the offices of the Cunard and the White Star\r\nbrought Mrs. Hignett the depressing information that it would be a full\r\nweek before she could sail for England. That meant that the inflammable\r\nEustace would have over two weeks to conduct an uninterrupted wooing,\r\nand Mrs. Hignett's heart sank, till suddenly she remembered that so\r\npoor a sailor as her son was not likely to have had leisure for any\r\nstrolling on the deck during the voyage of the _Atlantic_.\r\n\r\nHaving realised this, she became calmer and went about her preparations\r\nfor departure with an easier mind. The danger was still great, but\r\nthere was a good chance that she might be in time to intervene. She\r\nwound up her affairs in New York and, on the following Wednesday,\r\nboarded the _Nuronia_ bound for Southampton.\r\n\r\nThe _Nuronia_ is one of the slowest of the Cunard boats. It was\r\nbuilt at a time when delirious crowds used to swoon on the dock if an\r\nocean liner broke the record by getting across in nine days. It rolled\r\nover to Cherbourg, dallied at that picturesque port for some hours,\r\nthen sauntered across the Channel and strolled into Southampton Water\r\nin the evening of the day on which Samuel Marlowe had sat in the lane\r\nplotting with Webster, the valet. At almost the exact moment when Sam,\r\nsidling through the windows of the drawing-room, slid into the cupboard\r\nbehind the piano, Mrs. Hignett was standing at the Customs barrier\r\ntelling the officials that she had nothing to declare.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett was a general who believed in forced marches. A lesser\r\nwoman might have taken the boat-train to London and proceeded to\r\nWindles at her ease on the following afternoon. Mrs. Hignett was made\r\nof sterner stuff. Having fortified herself with a late dinner, she\r\nhired an automobile and set out on the cross-country journey. It was\r\nonly when the car, a genuine antique, had broken down three times in\r\nthe first ten miles, that it became evident to her that it would be much\r\ntoo late to go to Windles that night, and she directed the driver to take\r\nher instead to the \"Blue Boar\" in Windlehurst, where she arrived, tired\r\nbut thankful to have reached it at all, at about eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nAt this point many, indeed most, women, having had a tiring journey,\r\nwould have gone to bed: but the familiar Hampshire air and the\r\nknowledge that half an hour's walking would take her to her beloved\r\nhome acted on Mrs. Hignett like a restorative. One glimpse of Windles\r\nshe felt that she must have before she retired for the night, if only\r\nto assure herself that it was still there. She had a cup of coffee and\r\na sandwich brought to her by the night-porter, whom she had roused from\r\nsleep, for bedtime is early in Windlehurst, and then informed him that\r\nshe was going for a short walk and would ring when she returned.\r\n\r\nHer heart leaped joyfully as she turned in at the drive gates of her\r\nhome and felt the well-remembered gravel crunching under her feet. The\r\nsilhouette of the ruined castle against the summer sky gave her the\r\nfeeling which all returning wanderers know. And, when she stepped\r\non to the lawn and looked at the black bulk of the house, indistinct\r\nand shadowy with its backing of trees, tears came into her eyes. She\r\nexperienced a rush of emotion which made her feel quite faint, and\r\nwhich lasted until, on tiptoeing nearer to the house in order to gloat\r\nmore adequately upon it, she perceived that the French windows of the\r\ndrawing-room were standing ajar. Sam had left them like this in order\r\nto facilitate departure, if a hurried departure should by any mischance\r\nbe rendered necessary, and drawn curtains had kept the household from\r\nnoticing the fact.\r\n\r\nAll the proprietor in Mrs. Hignett was roused. This, she felt\r\nindignantly, was the sort of thing she had been afraid would happen the\r\nmoment her back was turned. Evidently laxity--one might almost say\r\nanarchy--had set in directly she had removed the eye of authority. She\r\nmarched to the window and pushed it open. She had now completely\r\nabandoned her kindly scheme of refraining from rousing the sleeping\r\nhouse and spending the night at the inn. She stepped into the drawing-room\r\nwith the single-minded purpose of rousing Eustace out of his sleep and\r\ngiving him a good talking to for having failed to maintain her own\r\nstandard of efficiency among the domestic staff. If there was one thing\r\non which Mrs. Horace Hignett had always insisted it was that every window\r\nin the house must be closed at lights-out.\r\n\r\nShe pushed the curtains apart with a rattle and, at the same moment,\r\nfrom the direction of the door there came a low but distinct gasp which\r\nmade her resolute heart jump and flutter. It was too dark to see\r\nanything distinctly, but, in the instant before it turned and fled, she\r\ncaught sight of a shadowy male figure, and knew that her worst fears\r\nhad been realised. The figure was too tall to be Eustace, and Eustace,\r\nshe knew, was the only man in the house. Male figures, therefore, that\r\nwent flitting about Windles, must be the figures of burglars.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett, bold woman though she was, stood for an instant\r\nspellbound, and for one moment of not unpardonable panic, tried to tell\r\nherself that she had been mistaken. Almost immediately, however, there\r\ncame from the direction of the hall a dull chunky sound as though\r\nsomething soft had been kicked, followed by a low gurgle and the noise\r\nof staggering feet. Unless he was dancing a _pas seul_ out of\r\nsheer lightness of heart, the nocturnal visitor must have tripped over\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nThe latter theory was the correct one. Montagu Webster was a man who at\r\nmany a subscription ball had shaken a wicked dancing-pump, and nothing\r\nin the proper circumstances pleased him better than to exercise the\r\nskill which had become his as the result of twelve private lessons at\r\nhalf-a-crown a visit: but he recognized the truth of the scriptural\r\nadage that there is a time for dancing, and that this was not it. His\r\nonly desire when, stealing into the drawing-room he had been confronted\r\nthrough the curtains by a female figure, was to get back to his bedroom\r\nundetected. He supposed that one of the feminine members of the\r\nhouse-party must have been taking a stroll in the grounds, and he did not\r\nwish to stay and be compelled to make laborious explanations of his\r\npresence there in the dark. He decided to postpone the knocking on the\r\ncupboard door, which had been the signal arranged between himself and\r\nSam, until a more suitable occasion. In the meantime he bounded\r\nsilently out into the hall, and instantaneously tripped over the portly\r\nform of Smith, the bulldog, who, roused from a light sleep to the\r\nknowledge that something was going on, and being a dog who always liked\r\nto be in the centre of the maelstrom of events, had waddled out to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nBy the time Mrs. Hignett had pulled herself together sufficiently to\r\nfeel brave enough to venture into the hall, Webster's presence of mind\r\nand Smith's gregariousness had combined to restore that part of the\r\nhouse to its normal nocturnal condition of emptiness. Webster's stagger\r\nhad carried him almost up to the green baize door leading to the\r\nservants' staircase, and he proceeded to pass through it without\r\nchecking his momentum, closely followed by Smith who, now convinced\r\nthat interesting events were in progress which might possibly culminate\r\nin cake, had abandoned the idea of sleep and meant to see the thing\r\nthrough. He gambolled in Webster's wake up the stairs and along the\r\npassage leading to the latter's room, and only paused when the door was\r\nbrusquely shut in his face. Upon which he sat down to think the thing\r\nover. He was in no hurry. The night was before him, promising, as far\r\nas he could judge from the way it had opened, excellent entertainment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett had listened fearfully to the uncouth noises from the\r\nhall. The burglars--she had now discovered that there were at least two\r\nof them--appeared to be actually romping. The situation had grown beyond\r\nher handling. If this troupe of terpsichorean marauders was to be\r\ndislodged she must have assistance. It was man's work. She made a brave\r\ndash through the hall, mercifully unmolested: found the stairs: raced up\r\nthem: and fell through the doorway of her son Eustace's bedroom like a\r\nspent Marathon runner staggering past the winning-post.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIn the moment which elapsed before either of the two could calm their\r\nagitated brains to speech, Eustace became aware, as never before, of\r\nthe truth of that well-known line, \"Peace, perfect Peace, with loved\r\nones far away!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eustace!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett gasped, hand on heart.\r\n\r\n\"Eustace, there are men in the house!\"\r\n\r\nThis fact was just the one which Eustace had been wondering how to\r\nbreak to her.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he said uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"You know!\" Mrs. Hignett stared. \"Did you hear them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear them?\" said Eustace, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"The drawing-room window was left open, and there are two burglars in\r\nthe hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say, no! That's rather rotten!\" said Eustace.\r\n\r\n\"I saw and heard them. Come with me and arrest them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't. I've sprained my ankle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sprained your ankle? How very inconvenient! When did you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"This morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\nEustace hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"I was jumping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jumping! But--oh!\" Mrs. Hignett's sentence trailed off into a\r\nsuppressed shriek, as the door opened.\r\n\r\nImmediately following on Eustace's accident, Jane Hubbard had\r\nconstituted herself his nurse. It was she who had bound up his injured\r\nankle in a manner which the doctor on his arrival had admitted himself\r\nunable to improve upon. She had sat with him through the long\r\nafternoon. And now, fearing lest a return of the pain might render him\r\nsleepless, she had come to bring him a selection of books to see him\r\nthrough the night.\r\n\r\nJane Hubbard was a girl who by nature and training was well adapted to\r\nbear shocks. She accepted the advent of Mrs. Hignett without visible\r\nastonishment, though inwardly she was wondering who the visitor might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening,\" she said, placidly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett, having rallied from her moment of weakness, glared at the\r\nnew arrival dumbly. She could not place Jane. She had the air of a\r\nnurse, and yet she wore no uniform.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" she asked stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Who are _you_?\" countered Jane.\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said Mrs. Hignett portentously, \"am the owner of this house, and I\r\nshould be glad to know what you are doing in it. I am Mrs. Horace\r\nHignett.\"\r\n\r\nA charming smile spread itself over Jane's finely-cut face.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad to meet you,\" she said. \"I have heard so much about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Mrs. Hignett. \"And now I should like to hear a little\r\nabout you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've read all your books,\" said Jane. \"I think they're wonderful.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, in spite of a feeling that this young woman was\r\nstraying from the point, Mrs. Hignett could not check a slight influx\r\nof amiability. She was an authoress who received a good deal of incense\r\nfrom admirers, but she could always do with a bit more. Besides, most\r\nof the incense came by mail. Living a quiet and retired life in the\r\ncountry, it was rarely that she got it handed to her face to face. She\r\nmelted quite perceptibly. She did not cease to look like a basilisk,\r\nbut she began to look like a basilisk who has had a good lunch.\r\n\r\n\"My favorite,\" said Jane, who for a week had been sitting daily in a\r\nchair in the drawing-room adjoining the table on which the authoress's\r\ncomplete works were assembled, \"is 'The Spreading Light.' I _do_\r\nlike 'The Spreading Light!'\"\r\n\r\n\"It was written some years ago,\" said Mrs. Hignett with something\r\napproaching cordiality, \"and I have since revised some of the views I\r\nstate in it, but I still consider it quite a good text-book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I can see that 'What of the Morrow?' is more profound,\"\r\nsaid Jane. \"But I read 'The Spreading Light' first, and of course that\r\nmakes a difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can quite see that it would,\" agreed Mrs. Hignett. \"One's first step\r\nacross the threshold of a new mind, one's first glimpse....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it makes you feel....\"\r\n\r\n\"Like some watcher of the skies,\" said Mrs. Hignett, \"when a new planet\r\nswims into his ken, or like....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, doesn't it!\" said Jane.\r\n\r\nEustace, who had been listening to the conversation with every muscle\r\ntense, in much the same mental attitude as that of a peaceful citizen in\r\na Wild West saloon who holds himself in readiness to dive under a table\r\ndirectly the shooting begins, began to relax. What he had shrinkingly\r\nanticipated would be the biggest thing since the Dempsey-Carpentier\r\nfight seemed to be turning into a pleasant social and literary evening\r\nnot unlike what he imagined a meeting of old Vassar alumni must be. For\r\nthe first time since his mother had come into the room he indulged in\r\nthe luxury of a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"But what are you doing here?\" asked Mrs. Hignett, returning almost\r\nreluctantly to the main issue.\r\n\r\nEustace perceived that he had breathed too soon. In an unobtrusive way\r\nhe subsided into the bed and softly pulled the sheets over his head,\r\nfollowing the excellent tactics of the great Duke of Wellington in his\r\nPeninsular campaign. \"When in doubt,\" the Duke used to say, \"retire and\r\ndig yourself in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm nursing dear Eustace,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett quivered, and cast an eye on the hump in the bed-clothes\r\nwhich represented dear Eustace. A cold fear had come upon her.\r\n\r\n\"'Dear Eustace'!\" she repeated mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"We're engaged,\" said Jane. \"We got engaged this morning. That's how he\r\nsprained his ankle. When I accepted him, he tried to jump a holly-bush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Engaged! Eustace, is this true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said a muffled voice from the interior of the bed.\r\n\r\n\"And poor Eustace is so worried,\" continued Jane, \"about the house.\"\r\nShe went on quickly. \"He doesn't want to deprive you of it, because he\r\nknows what it means to you. So he is hoping--we are both hoping--that\r\nyou will accept it as a present when we are married. We really shan't\r\nwant it, you know. We are going to live in London. So you will take it,\r\nwon't you--to please us?\"\r\n\r\nWe all of us, even the greatest of us, have our moments of weakness.\r\nLet us then not express any surprise at the sudden collapse of one of\r\nthe world's greatest female thinkers. As the meaning of this speech\r\nsmote on Mrs. Horace Hignett's understanding, she sank weeping into a\r\nchair. The ever-present fear that had haunted her had been exorcised.\r\nWindles was hers in perpetuity. The relief was too great. She sat in\r\nher chair and gulped: and Eustace, greatly encouraged, emerged slowly\r\nfrom the bedclothes like a worm after a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nHow long this poignant scene would have lasted, one cannot say. It is a\r\npity that it was cut short, for I should have liked to dwell upon it.\r\nBut at this moment, from the regions downstairs, there suddenly burst\r\nupon the silent night such a whirlwind of sound as effectually\r\ndissipated the tense emotion in the room. Somebody had touched off the\r\norchestrion in the drawing-room, and that willing instrument had begun\r\nagain in the middle of a bar at the point where it had been switched\r\noff. Its wailing lament for the passing of Summer filled the whole\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"That's too bad!\" said Jane, a little annoyed. \"At this time of night!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the burglars!\" quavered Mrs. Hignett. In the stress of recent\r\nevents she had completely forgotten the existence of those enemies of\r\nsociety. \"They were dancing in the hall when I arrived, and now they're\r\nplaying the orchestrion!\"\r\n\r\n\"Light-hearted chaps!\" said Eustace, admiring the sang-froid of the\r\ncriminal world. \"Full of spirits!\"\r\n\r\n\"This won't do,\" said Jane Hubbard, shaking her head. \"We can't have\r\nthis sort of thing. I'll go and fetch my gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll murder you, dear!\" panted Mrs. Hignett, clinging to her arm.\r\n\r\nJane Hubbard laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Murder _me_!\" she said, amusedly. \"I'd like to catch them at it!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett stood staring at the door as Jane closed it safely behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Eustace,\" she said, solemnly, \"that is a wonderful girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! She once killed a panther--or a puma, I forget which--with a\r\nhat-pin!\" said Eustace with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"I could wish you no better wife!\" said Mrs. Hignett.\r\n\r\nShe broke off with a sharp wail.... Out in the passage something like a\r\nbattery of artillery had roared.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Jane Hubbard appeared, slipping a fresh cartridge\r\ninto the elephant-gun.\r\n\r\n\"One of them was popping about outside here,\" she announced. \"I took a\r\nshot at him, but I'm afraid I missed. The visibility was bad. At any\r\nrate he went away.\"\r\n\r\nIn this last statement she was perfectly accurate. Bream Mortimer, who\r\nhad been aroused by the orchestrion and who had come out to see what\r\nwas the matter, had gone away at the rate of fifty miles an hour. He\r\nhad been creeping down the passage when he found himself suddenly\r\nconfronted by a dim figure which, without a word, had attempted to slay\r\nhim with an enormous gun. The shot had whistled past his ears and gone\r\nsinging down the corridor. This was enough for Bream. He had returned\r\nto his room in three strides, and was now under the bed. The burglars\r\nmight take everything in the house and welcome, so that they did not\r\nmolest his privacy. That was the way Bream looked at it. And very\r\nsensible of him, too, I consider.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better go downstairs,\" said Jane. \"Bring the candle. Not you,\r\nEustace, darling. Don't you stir out of bed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" said Eustace obediently.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nOf all the leisured pursuits, there are few less attractive to the\r\nthinking man than sitting in a dark cupboard waiting for a house-party\r\nto go to bed: and Sam, who had established himself in the one behind\r\nthe piano at a quarter to eight, soon began to feel as if he had been\r\nthere for an eternity. He could dimly remember a previous existence in\r\nwhich he had not been sitting in his present position, but it seemed so\r\nlong ago that it was shadowy and unreal to him. The ordeal of spending\r\nthe evening in this retreat had not appeared formidable when he had\r\ncontemplated it that afternoon in the lane: but, now that he was\r\nactually undergoing it, it was extraordinary how many disadvantages it\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nCupboards, as a class, are badly ventilated, and this one seemed to\r\ncontain no air at all: and the warmth of the night, combined with the\r\ncupboard's natural stuffiness, had soon begun to reduce Sam to a\r\ncondition of pulp. He seemed to himself to be sagging like an ice-cream\r\nin front of a fire. The darkness, too, weighed upon him. He was\r\nabominably thirsty. Also he wanted to smoke. In addition to this, the\r\nsmall of his back tickled, and he more than suspected the cupboard of\r\nharboring mice. Not once nor twice but many hundred times he wished\r\nthat the ingenious Webster had thought of something simpler.\r\n\r\nHis was a position which would just have suited one of those Indian\r\nmystics who sit perfectly still for twenty years, contemplating the\r\nInfinite; but it reduced Sam to an almost imbecile state of boredom. He\r\ntried counting sheep. He tried going over his past life in his mind\r\nfrom the earliest moment he could recollect, and thought he had never\r\nencountered a duller series of episodes. He found a temporary solace by\r\nplaying a succession of mental golf-games over all the courses he could\r\nremember, and he was just teeing up for the sixteenth at Muirfield, after\r\nplaying Hoylake, St. Andrews, Westward Ho, Hanger Hill, Mid-Surrey,\r\nWalton Heath, Garden City, and the Engineers' Club at Roslyn, L. I.,\r\nwhen the light ceased to shine through the crack under the door,\r\nand he awoke with a sense of dull incredulity to the realisation that\r\nthe occupants of the drawing-room had called it a day and that his\r\nvigil was over.\r\n\r\nBut was it? Once more alert, Sam became cautious. True, the light\r\nseemed to be off, but did that mean anything in a country-house, where\r\npeople had the habit of going and strolling about the garden at all\r\nhours? Probably they were still popping about all over the place. At any\r\nrate, it was not worth risking coming out of his lair. He remembered that\r\nWebster had promised to come and knock an all-clear signal on the door.\r\nIt would be safer to wait for that.\r\n\r\nBut the moments went by, and there was no knock. Sam began to grow\r\nimpatient. The last few minutes of waiting in a cupboard are always the\r\nhardest. Time seemed to stretch out again interminably. Once he thought\r\nhe heard foot-steps, but that led to nothing. Eventually, having\r\nstrained his ears and finding everything still, he decided to take a\r\nchance. He fished in his pocket for the key, cautiously unlocked the\r\ndoor, opened it by slow inches, and peered out.\r\n\r\nThe room was in blackness. The house was still. All was well. With the\r\nfeeling of a life-prisoner emerging from the Bastille, he began to\r\ncrawl stiffly forward: and it was just then that the first of the\r\ndisturbing events occurred which were to make this night memorable to\r\nhim. Something like a rattlesnake suddenly went off with a whirr, and\r\nhis head, jerking up, collided with the piano. It was only the\r\ncuckoo-clock, which now, having cleared its throat as was its custom\r\nbefore striking, proceeded to cuck eleven times in rapid succession\r\nbefore subsiding with another rattle: but to Sam it sounded like the end\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nHe sat in the darkness, massaging his bruised skull. His hours of\r\nimprisonment in the cupboard had had a bad effect on his nervous\r\nsystem, and he vacillated between tears of weakness and a militant\r\ndesire to get at the cuckoo-clock with a hatchet. He felt that it had\r\ndone it on purpose and was now chuckling to itself in fancied security.\r\nFor quite a minute he raged silently, and any cuckoo-clock which had\r\nstrayed within his reach would have had a bad time of it. Then his\r\nattention was diverted.\r\n\r\nSo concentrated was Sam on his private vendetta with the clock that no\r\nordinary happening would have had the power to distract him. What\r\noccurred now was by no means ordinary, and it distracted him like an\r\nelectric shock. As he sat on the floor, passing a tender hand over the\r\negg-shaped bump which had already begun to manifest itself beneath his\r\nhair, something cold and wet touched his face, and paralysed him so\r\ncompletely both physically and mentally that he did not move a muscle\r\nbut just congealed where he sat into a solid block of ice. He felt\r\nvaguely that this was the end. His heart stopped beating and he simply\r\ncould not imagine it ever starting again, and, if your heart refuses to\r\nbeat, what hope is there for you?\r\n\r\nAt this moment something heavy and solid struck him squarely in the\r\nchest, rolling him over. Something gurgled asthmatically in the\r\ndarkness. Something began to lick his eyes, ears, and chin in a sort of\r\necstasy: and, clutching out, he found his arms full of totally\r\nunexpected bulldog.\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\" whispered Sam tensely, recovering his faculties with a jerk.\r\n\"Go away!\"\r\n\r\nSmith took the opportunity of his lips having opened to lick the roof\r\nof his mouth. Smith's attitude in the matter was that providence in its\r\nall-seeing wisdom had sent him a human being at a moment when he had\r\nreluctantly been compelled to reconcile himself to a total absence of\r\nsuch indispensable adjuncts to a good time, and that now the revels\r\nmight commence. He had just trotted downstairs in rather a disconsolate\r\nframe of mind after waiting with no result in front of Webster's\r\nbedroom door, and it was a real treat to him to meet a man, especially\r\none seated in such a jolly and sociable manner on the floor. He welcomed\r\nSam like a long-lost friend.\r\n\r\nBetween Smith and the humans who provided him with dog-biscuits and\r\noccasionally with sweet cakes there had always existed a state of\r\nmisunderstanding which no words could remove. The position of the\r\nhumans was quite clear. They had elected Smith to his present position\r\non a straight watch-dog ticket. They expected him to be one of those\r\ndogs who rouse the house and save the spoons. They looked to him to pin\r\nburglars by the leg and hold on till the police arrived. Smith simply\r\ncould not grasp such an attitude of mind. He regarded Windles not as a\r\nprivate house but as a social club, and was utterly unable to see any\r\ndifference between the human beings he knew and the strangers who\r\ndropped in for a late chat after the place was locked up. He had no\r\nintention of biting Sam. The idea never entered his head. At the\r\npresent moment what he felt about Sam was that he was one of the best\r\nfellows he had ever met and that he loved him like a brother.\r\n\r\nSam, in his unnerved state, could not bring himself to share these\r\namiable sentiments. He was thinking bitterly that Webster might have\r\nhad the intelligence to warn him of bulldogs on the premises. It was\r\njust the sort of woollen-headed thing fellows did, forgetting facts\r\nlike that. He scrambled stiffly to his feet and tried to pierce the\r\ndarkness that hemmed him in. He ignored Smith, who snuffled sportively\r\nabout his ankles, and made for the slightly less black oblong which he\r\ntook to be the door leading into the hall. He moved warily, but not\r\nwarily enough to prevent him cannoning into and almost upsetting a\r\nsmall table with a vase on it. The table rocked and the vase jumped,\r\nand the first bit of luck that had come to Sam that night was when he\r\nreached out at a venture and caught it just as it was about to bound on\r\nto the carpet.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, shaking. The narrowness of the escape turned him cold.\r\nIf he had been an instant later, there would have been a crash loud\r\nenough to wake a dozen sleeping houses. This sort of thing could not go\r\non. He must have light. It might be a risk: there might be a chance of\r\nsomebody upstairs seeing it and coming down to investigate: but it was\r\na risk that must be taken. He declined to go on stumbling about in this\r\ndarkness any longer. He groped his way with infinite care to the door,\r\non the wall adjoining which, he presumed, the electric-light switch\r\nwould be.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ten years since he had last been inside Windles, and it\r\nnever occurred to him that in this progressive age even a woman like\r\nhis aunt Adeline, of whom he could believe almost anything, would still\r\nbe using candles and oil-lamps as a means of illumination. His only\r\ndoubt was whether the switch was where it was in most houses, near the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nIt is odd to reflect that, as his searching fingers touched the knob, a\r\ndelicious feeling of relief came to Samuel Marlowe. This misguided\r\nyoung man actually felt at that moment that his troubles were over. He\r\npositively smiled as he placed a thumb on the knob and shoved.\r\n\r\nHe shoved strongly and sharply, and instantaneously there leaped at him\r\nout of the darkness a blare of music which appeared to his disordered\r\nmind quite solid. It seemed to wrap itself round him. It was all over\r\nthe place. In a single instant the world had become one vast bellow of\r\nTosti's \"Goodbye.\"\r\n\r\nHow long he stood there, frozen, he did not know: nor can one say how\r\nlong he would have stood there had nothing further come to invite his\r\nnotice elsewhere. But, suddenly, drowning even the impromptu concert,\r\nthere came from somewhere upstairs the roar of a gun, and, when he heard\r\nthat, Sam's rigid limbs relaxed and a violent activity descended upon\r\nhim. He bounded out into the hall, looking to right and to left for a\r\nhiding-place. One of the suits of armour which had been familiar to him\r\nin his boyhood loomed up in front of him, and with the sight came the\r\nrecollection of how, when a mere child on his first visit to Windles,\r\nplaying hide and seek with his cousin Eustace, he had concealed himself\r\ninside this very suit and had not only baffled Eustace through a long\r\nsummer evening but had wound up by almost scaring him into a decline by\r\nbooing at him through the vizor of the helmet. Happy days, happy days!\r\nHe leaped at the suit of armour. The helmet was a tight fit, but he\r\nmanaged to get his head into it at last, and the body of the thing was\r\nquite roomy.\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe was not comfortable, but comfort just then was not his primary need.\r\n\r\nSmith, the bulldog, well satisfied with the way things had happened,\r\nsat down, wheezing slightly, to await developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nHe had not long to wait. In a few minutes the hall had filled up\r\nnicely. There was Mr. Mortimer in his shirt-sleeves, Mr. Bennett in his\r\npyjamas and a dressing-gown, Mrs. Hignett in a travelling costume, Jane\r\nHubbard with her elephant-gun, and Billie in a dinner dress. Smith\r\nwelcomed them all impartially.\r\n\r\nSomebody lit a lamp, and Mrs. Hignett stared speechlessly at the mob.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bennett! Mr. Mortimer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Hignett! What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hignett drew herself up stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"What an odd question, Mr. Mortimer! I am in my own house!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you rented it to me for the summer. At least, your son did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eustace let you Windles for the summer!\" said Mrs. Hignett,\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\nJane Hubbard returned from the drawing-room, where she had been\r\nswitching off the orchestrion.\r\n\r\n\"Let us talk all that over cosily to-morrow,\" she said. \"The point now\r\nis that there are burglars in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Burglars!\" cried Mr. Bennett aghast. \"I thought it was you playing\r\nthat infernal instrument, Mortimer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth should I play it for at this time of night?\" said Mr.\r\nMortimer irritably.\r\n\r\nIt appeared only too evident that the two old friends were again on the\r\nverge of one of their distressing fallings-out: but Jane Hubbard\r\nintervened once more. This practical-minded girl disliked the\r\nintroducing of side-issues into the conversation. She was there to talk\r\nabout burglars, and she intended to do so.\r\n\r\n\"For goodness sake stop it!\" she said, almost petulantly for one\r\nusually so superior to emotion. \"There'll be lots of time for\r\nquarrelling to-morrow. Just now we've got to catch these....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not quarrelling,\" said Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are,\" said Mr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't argue!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not arguing!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not!\"\r\n\r\nJane Hubbard had practically every noble quality which a woman can\r\npossess with the exception of patience. A patient woman would have\r\nstood by, shrinking from interrupting the dialogue. Jane Hubbard's\r\nrobuster course was to raise the elephant-gun, point it at the front\r\ndoor, and pull the trigger.\r\n\r\n\"I thought that would stop you,\" she said complacently, as the echoes\r\ndied away and Mr. Bennett had finished leaping into the air. She\r\ninserted a fresh cartridge, and sloped arms. \"Now, the question is....\"\r\n\r\n\"You made me bite my tongue!\" said Mr. Bennett, deeply aggrieved.\r\n\r\n\"Serves you right!\" said Jane placidly. \"Now, the question is, have the\r\nfellows got away or are they hiding somewhere in the house? I think\r\nthey're still in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"The police!\" exclaimed Mr. Bennett, forgetting his lacerated tongue\r\nand his other grievances. \"We must summon the police!\"\r\n\r\n\"Obviously!\" said Mrs. Hignett, withdrawing her fascinated gaze from\r\nthe ragged hole in the front door, the cost of repairing which she had\r\nbeen mentally assessing. \"We must send for the police at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't really need them, you know,\" said Jane. \"If you'll all go to\r\nbed and just leave me to potter round with my gun....\"\r\n\r\n\"And blow the whole house to pieces!\" said Mrs. Hignett tartly. She had\r\nbegun to revise her original estimate of this girl. To her, Windles was\r\nsacred, and anyone who went about shooting holes in it forfeited her\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I go for the police?\" said Billie. \"I could bring them back in\r\nten minutes in the car.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not!\" said Mr. Bennett. \"My daughter gadding about all over\r\nthe countryside in an automobile at this time of night!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think I ought not to go alone, I could take Bream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where _is_ Bream?\" said Mr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\nThe odd fact that Bream was not among those present suddenly presented\r\nitself to the company.\r\n\r\n\"Where can he be?\" said Billie.\r\n\r\nJane Hubbard laughed the wholesome, indulgent laugh of one who is\r\nbroad-minded enough to see the humor of the situation even when the\r\njoke is at her expense.\r\n\r\n\"What a silly girl I am!\" she said. \"I do believe that was Bream I shot\r\nat upstairs. How foolish of me making a mistake like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shot my only son!\" cried Mr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"I shot _at_ him,\" said Jane. \"My belief is that I missed him.\r\nThough how I came to do it beats me. I don't suppose I've missed a\r\nsitter like that since I was a child in the nursery. Of course,\" she\r\nproceeded, looking on the reasonable side, \"the visibility wasn't good,\r\nand I fired from the hip, but it's no use saying I oughtn't at least to\r\nhave winged him, because I ought.\" She shook her head with a touch of\r\nself-reproach. \"I shall be chaffed about this if it comes out,\" she\r\nsaid regretfully.\r\n\r\n\"The poor boy must be in his room,\" said Mr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"Under the bed, if you ask me,\" said Jane, blowing on the barrel of her\r\ngun and polishing it with the side of her hand. \"_He's_ all right!\r\nLeave him alone, and the housemaid will sweep him up in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he can't be!\" cried Billie, revolted.\r\n\r\nA girl of high spirit, it seemed to her repellent that the man she was\r\nengaged to marry should be displaying such a craven spirit. At that\r\nmoment she despised and hated Bream Mortimer. I think she was wrong,\r\nmind you. It is not my place to criticise the little group of people\r\nwhose simple annals I am relating--my position is merely that of a\r\nreporter--: but personally I think highly of Bream's sturdy common-sense.\r\nIf somebody loosed off an elephant gun at me in a dark corridor, I would\r\nclimb on to the roof and pull it up after me. Still, rightly or wrongly,\r\nthat was how Billie felt: and it flashed across her mind that Samuel\r\nMarlowe, scoundrel though he was, would not have behaved like this. And\r\nfor a moment a certain wistfulness added itself to the varied emotions\r\nthen engaging her mind.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go and look, if you like,\" said Jane agreeably. \"You amuse\r\nyourselves somehow till I come back.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran easily up the stairs, three at a time. Mr. Mortimer turned to\r\nMr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"It's all very well your saying Wilhelmina mustn't go, but, if she\r\ndoesn't, how can we get the police? The house isn't on the 'phone, and\r\nnobody else can drive the car.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Mr. Bennett, wavering.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going,\" said Billie resolutely. It occurred to her, as it has\r\noccurred to so many women before her, how helpless men are in a crisis.\r\nThe temporary withdrawal of Jane Hubbard had had the effect which the\r\nremoval of a rudder has on a boat. \"It's the only thing to do. I shall\r\nbe back in no time.\"\r\n\r\nShe stepped firmly to the coat-rack, and began to put on her\r\nmotoring-cloak. And just then Jane Hubbard came downstairs, shepherding\r\nbefore her a pale and glassy-eyed Bream.\r\n\r\n\"Right under the bed,\" she announced cheerfully, \"making a noise like a\r\npiece of fluff in order to deceive burglars.\"\r\n\r\nBillie cast a scornful look at her fiancee. Absolutely unjustified, in\r\nmy opinion, but nevertheless she cast it. But it had no effect at all.\r\nTerror had stunned Bream Mortimer's perceptions. His was what the\r\ndoctors call a penumbral mental condition. He was in a sort of trance.\r\n\r\n\"Bream,\" said Billie, \"I want you to come in the car with me to fetch\r\nthe police.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Bream.\r\n\r\n\"Get your coat.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Bream.\r\n\r\n\"And cap.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Bream.\r\n\r\nHe followed Billie in a docile manner out through the front door, and they\r\nmade their way to the garage at the back of the house, both silent. The\r\nonly difference between their respective silences was that Billie's was\r\nthoughtful, while Bream's was just the silence of a man who has unhitched\r\nhis brain and is getting along as well as he can without it.\r\n\r\nIn the hall they had left, Jane Hubbard once more took command of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's something done,\" she said, scratching Smith's broad back\r\nwith the muzzle of her weapon. \"Something accomplished, something done,\r\nhas earned a night's repose. Not that we're going to get it yet. I\r\nthink those fellows are hiding somewhere, and we ought to search the\r\nhouse and rout them out. It's a pity Smith isn't a bloodhound. I like\r\nyou personally, Smithy, but you're about as much practical use in a\r\nsituation like this as a cold in the head. You're a good cake-hound,\r\nbut as a watch-dog you don't finish in the first ten.\"\r\n\r\nThe cake-hound, charmed at the compliment, frisked about her feet like\r\na young elephant.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing to do,\" continued Jane, \"is to go through the\r\nground-floor rooms....\" She paused to strike a match against the suit\r\nof armour nearest to her, a proceeding which elicited a sharp cry of\r\nprotest from Mrs. Hignett, and lit a cigarette. \"I'll go first, as I've\r\ngot a gun....\" She blew a cloud of smoke. \"I shall want somebody with me\r\nto carry a light, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"Tchoo!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't speak,\" said Mr. Mortimer. \"Who am I to speak?\" he went on\r\nbitterly. \"Who am I that it should be supposed that I have anything\r\nsensible to suggest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody spoke,\" said Jane. \"I....\"\r\n\r\n\"Achoo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you feel a draught, Mr. Bennett?\" cried Jane sharply, wheeling\r\nround on him.\r\n\r\n\"There _is_ a draught,\" began Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"Well, finish sneezing and I'll go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't sneeze!\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody sneezed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to come from just behind you,\" said Mrs. Hignett nervously.\r\n\r\n\"It couldn't have come from just behind me,\" said Jane, \"because there\r\nisn't anything behind me from which it could have....\" She stopped\r\nsuddenly, in her eyes the light of understanding, on her face the set\r\nexpression which was wont to come to it on the eve of action. \"Oh!\" she\r\nsaid in a different voice, a voice which was cold and tense and\r\nsinister. \"Oh, I see!\" She raised her gun, and placed a muscular\r\nforefinger on the trigger. \"Come out of that!\" she said. \"Come out of\r\nthat suit of armour and let's have a look at you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can explain everything,\" said a muffled voice through the vizor of\r\nthe helmet. \"I can--achoo.\" The smoke of the cigarette tickled Sam's\r\nnostrils again, and he suspended his remarks.\r\n\r\n\"I shall count three,\" said Jane Hubbard. \"One--two--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming! I'm coming!\" said Sam petulantly.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better!\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"I can't get this dashed helmet off!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't come quick, I'll blow it off.\"\r\n\r\nSam stepped out into the hall, a picturesque figure which combined the\r\ncostumes of two widely separated centuries. Modern as far as the neck,\r\nhe slipped back at that point to the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\"Hands up!\" commanded Jane Hubbard.\r\n\r\n\"My hands _are_ up!\" retorted Sam querulously, as he wrenched at\r\nhis unbecoming head-wear.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind trying to raise your hat,\" said Jane. \"If you've lost the\r\ncombination, we'll dispense with the formalities. What we're anxious to\r\nhear is what you're doing in the house at this time of night, and who\r\nyour pals are. Come along, my lad, make a clean breast of it and\r\nperhaps you'll get off easier. Are you a gang?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I look like a gang?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ask me what you look like....\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Marlowe ... Samuel Marlowe....\"\r\n\r\n\"Alias what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alias nothing! I say my name is Samuel Marlowe....\"\r\n\r\nAn explosive roar burst from Mr. Bennett. \"The scoundrel! I know him! I\r\nforbade him the house, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"And by what right did you forbid people my house, Mr. Bennett?\" said\r\nMrs. Hignett with acerbity.\r\n\r\n\"I've rented the house, Mortimer and I rented it from your son....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" said Jane Hubbard. \"Never mind about that. So you know\r\nthis fellow, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know him!\"\r\n\r\n\"You said you did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to know him!\" went on Mr. Bennett. \"I won't know him! I\r\ndecline to have anything to do with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you identify him?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he says he's Samuel Marlowe,\" assented Mr. Bennett grudgingly, \"I\r\nsuppose he is. I can't imagine anybody saying he was Samuel Marlowe if\r\nhe didn't know it could be proved against him.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Are_ you my nephew Samuel?\" said Mrs. Hignett.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are you doing in my house?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's _my_ house,\" said Mr. Bennett, \"for the summer, Henry\r\nMortimer's and mine. Isn't that right, Henry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead right,\" said Mr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Mr. Bennett. \"You hear? And when Henry Mortimer says a\r\nthing, it's so. There's nobody's word I'd take before Henry\r\nMortimer's.\"\r\n\r\n\"When Rufus Bennett makes an assertion,\" said Mr. Mortimer, highly\r\nflattered by these kind words, \"you can bank on it, Rufus Bennett's\r\nword is his bond. Rufus Bennett is a white man!\"\r\n\r\nThe two old friends clasped hands with a good deal of feeling.\r\n\r\n\"I am not disputing Mr. Bennett's claim to belong to the Caucasian\r\nrace,\" said Mrs. Hignett, \"I merely maintain that this house is....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes, yes!\" interrupted Jane. \"You can thresh all that out\r\nsome other time. The point is, if this fellow is your nephew, I don't\r\nsee what we can do. We'll have to let him go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to this house,\" said Sam, raising his vizor to facilitate\r\nspeech, \"to make a social call....\"\r\n\r\n\"At this hour of the night!\" snapped Mrs. Hignett. \"You always were\r\nan inconsiderate boy, Samuel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to enquire after poor Eustace's ankle. I've only just heard\r\nthat the poor chap was ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's getting along quite well,\" said Jane, melting. \"If I had known\r\nyou were so fond of Eustace....\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, is he?\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not quite all right, but he's going on very nicely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eustace and I are engaged, you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, really? Splendid! I can't see you very distinctly--how those\r\nJohnnies in the old days ever contrived to put up a scrap with things like\r\nthis on their heads beats me--but you sound a good sort. I hope you'll\r\nbe very happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you ever so much, Mr. Marlowe. I'm sure we shall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eustace is one of the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"How nice of you to say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this,\" interrupted Mrs. Hignett, who had been a chafing auditor of\r\nthis interchange of courtesies, \"is beside the point. Why did you dance\r\nin the hall, Samuel, and play the orchestrion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Bennett, reminded of his grievance, \"waking people up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scaring us all to death!\" complained Mr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"I remember you as a boy, Samuel,\" said Mrs. Hignett, \"lamentably\r\nlacking in consideration for others and concentrated only on your\r\nselfish pleasures. You seem to have altered very little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ballyrag the poor man,\" said Jane Hubbard. \"Be human! Lend him a\r\ncan-opener!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do nothing of the sort,\" said Mrs. Hignett. \"I never liked him\r\nand I dislike him now. He has got himself into this trouble through his\r\nown wrong-headedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not his fault his head's the wrong size,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"He must get himself out as best he can,\" said Mrs. Hignett.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Sam with bitter dignity. \"Then I will not trespass\r\nfurther on your hospitality, Aunt Adeline. I have no doubt the local\r\nblacksmith will be able to get this damned thing off me. I shall go to\r\nhim now. I will let you have the helmet back by parcel-post at the\r\nearliest possible opportunity. Good night!\" He walked coldly to the\r\nfront door. \"And there are people,\" he remarked sardonically, \"who say\r\nthat blood is thicker than water! I'll bet they never had any aunts!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nBillie, meanwhile, with Bream trotting docilely at her heels, had\r\nreached the garage and started the car. Like all cars which have been\r\nspending a considerable time in secluded inaction, it did not start\r\nreadily. At each application of Billie's foot on the self-starter, it\r\nemitted a tinny and reproachful sound and then seemed to go to sleep\r\nagain. Eventually, however, the engines began to revolve and the\r\nmachine moved reluctantly out into the drive.\r\n\r\n\"The battery must be run down,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Bream.\r\n\r\nBillie cast a glance of contempt at him out of the corner of her eyes.\r\nShe hardly knew why she had spoken to him except that, as all\r\nautomobilists are aware, the impulse to say rude things about their\r\nbattery is almost irresistible. To an automobilist the art of\r\nconversation consists in rapping out scathing remarks either about the\r\nbattery or the oiling-system.\r\n\r\nBillie switched on the head-lights and turned the car down the dark\r\ndrive. She was feeling thoroughly upset. Her idealistic nature had\r\nreceived a painful shock on the discovery of the yellow streak in\r\nBream. To call it a yellow streak was to understate the facts. It was a\r\ngreat belt of saffron encircling his whole soul. That she, Wilhelmina\r\nBennett, who had gone through the world seeking a Galahad, should\r\nfinish her career as the wife of a man who hid under beds simply\r\nbecause people shot at him with elephant guns was abhorrent to her.\r\nWhy, Samuel Marlowe would have perished rather than do such a thing.\r\nYou might say what you liked about Samuel Marlowe--and, of course, his\r\nhabit of playing practical jokes put him beyond the pale--but nobody\r\ncould question his courage. Look at the way he had dived overboard that\r\ntime in the harbour at New York! Billie found herself thinking hard\r\nabout Samuel Marlowe.\r\n\r\nThere are only a few makes of car in which you can think hard about\r\nanything except the actual driving without stalling the engines, and\r\nMr. Bennett's Twin-Six Complex was not one of them. It stopped as if it\r\nhad been waiting for the signal. The noise of the engine died away. The\r\nwheels ceased to revolve. The automobile did everything except lie\r\ndown. It was a particularly pig-headed car and right from the start it\r\nhad been unable to see the sense in this midnight expedition. It seemed\r\nnow to have the idea that if it just lay low and did nothing, presently\r\nit would be taken back to its cosy garage.\r\n\r\nBillie trod on the self-starter. Nothing happened.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to get down and crank her,\" she said curtly.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Bream.\r\n\r\n\"Well, go on,\" said Billie impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out and crank her.\"\r\n\r\nBream emerged for an instant from his trance.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe art of cranking a car is one that is not given to all men. Some of\r\nour greatest and wisest stand helpless before the task. It is a job\r\ntowards the consummation of which a noble soul and a fine brain help\r\nnot at all. A man may have all the other gifts and yet be unable to\r\naccomplish a task the fellow at the garage does with one quiet quick\r\nflick of the wrist without even bothering to remove his chewing gum.\r\nThis being so, it was not only unkind but foolish of Billie to grow\r\nimpatient as Bream's repeated efforts failed of their object. It was\r\nwrong of her to click her tongue, and certainly she ought not to have\r\ntold Bream that he was not fit to churn butter. But women are an\r\nemotional sex and must be forgiven much in moments of mental stress.\r\n\r\n\"Give it a good sharp twist,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Bream.\r\n\r\n\"Here, let me do it,\" cried Billie.\r\n\r\nShe jumped down and snatched the thingummy from his hand. With bent\r\nbrows and set teeth she wrenched it round. The engine gave a faint\r\nprotesting mutter, like a dog that has been disturbed in its sleep, and\r\nwas still once more.\r\n\r\n\"May I help?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not Bream who spoke but a strange voice--a sepulchral voice,\r\nthe sort of voice someone would have used in one of Edgar Allen Poe's\r\ncheerful little tales if he had been buried alive and were speaking\r\nfrom the family vault. Coming suddenly out of the night it affected\r\nBream painfully. He uttered a sharp exclamation and gave a bound which,\r\nif he had been a Russian dancer, would probably have caused the\r\nmanagement to raise his salary. He was in no frame of mind to bear up\r\nunder sudden sepulchral voices.\r\n\r\nBillie, on the other hand, was pleased. The high-spirited girl was just\r\nbeginning to fear that she was unequal to the task which she had chided\r\nBream for being unable to perform and this was mortifying her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, would you mind? Thank you so much. The self-starter has gone\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nInto the glare of the head-lights there stepped a strange figure,\r\nstrange, that is to say, in these tame modern times. In the Middle Ages\r\nhe would have excited no comment at all. Passers-by would simply have\r\nsaid to themselves, \"Ah, another of those knights off after the\r\ndragons!\" and would have gone on their way with a civil greeting. But\r\nin the present age it is always somewhat startling to see a helmeted\r\nhead pop up in front of your automobile. At any rate, it startled\r\nBream. I will go further. It gave Bream the shock of a lifetime. He had\r\nhad shocks already that night, but none to be compared with this. Or\r\nperhaps it was that this shock, coming on top of those shocks, affected\r\nhim more disastrously than it would have done if it had been the first\r\nof the series instead of the last. One may express the thing briefly by\r\nsaying that, as far as Bream was concerned, Sam's unconventional\r\nappearance put the lid on it. He did not hesitate. He did not pause to\r\nmake comments or ask questions. With a single cat-like screech which\r\ntook years off the lives of the abruptly wakened birds roosting in the\r\nneighbouring trees, he dashed away towards the house and, reaching his\r\nroom, locked the door and pushed the bed, the chest of drawers, two\r\nchairs, the towel stand, and three pairs of boots against it. Only then\r\ndid he feel comparatively safe.\r\n\r\nOut on the drive Billie was staring at the man in armour who had now,\r\nwith a masterful wrench which informed the car right away that he would\r\nstand no nonsense, set the engine going again.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why,\" she stammered, \"why are you wearing that thing on your\r\nhead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I can't get it off.\"\r\n\r\nHollow as the voice was, Billie recognised it.\r\n\r\n\"S--Mr. Marlowe!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Get in,\" said Sam. He had seated himself at the steering wheel. \"Where\r\ncan I take you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go away!\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Get in!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to talk to _you!_ Get in!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't.\"\r\n\r\nSam bent over the side of the car, put his hands under her arms, lifted\r\nher like a kitten and deposited her on the seat beside him. Then\r\nthrowing in the clutch, he drove at an ever increasing speed down the\r\ndrive and out into the silent road. Strange creatures of the night came\r\nand went in the golden glow of the head-lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\"Put me down,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"You'd get hurt if I did, travelling at this pace.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drive about till you promise to marry me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to drive a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nThe car took a corner and purred down a lane. Billie reached out a hand\r\nand grabbed at the steering wheel. \"Of course, if you _want_ to\r\nsmash up in a ditch!\" said Sam, righting the car with a wrench.\r\n\r\n\"You're a brute!\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Cave-man stuff,\" explained Sam, \"I ought to have tried it before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you expect to gain by this.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Sam, \"I know what I'm about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would be.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Lean back and doze off. We've the whole night before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" cried Billie, sitting up with a jerk.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever been to Scotland?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we might push up there. We've got to go somewhere and, oddly\r\nenough, I've never been to Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nBillie regarded him blankly.\r\n\r\n\"Are you crazy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm crazy about you. If you knew what I've gone through to-night for\r\nyour sake you'd be more sympathetic. I love you,\" said Sam swerving to\r\navoid a rabbit. \"And what's more, you know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will!\" said Sam confidently. \"How about North Wales? I've heard\r\npeople speak well of North Wales. Shall we head for North Wales?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm engaged to Bream Mortimer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, that's all off,\" Sam assured her.\r\n\r\n\"It's not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Right off!\" said Sam firmly. \"You could never bring yourself to marry\r\na man who dashed away like that and deserted you in your hour of need.\r\nWhy, for all he knew, I might have tried to murder you. And he ran\r\naway! No, no, we eliminate Bream Mortimer once and for all. He won't\r\ndo!\"\r\n\r\nThis was so exactly what Billie was feeling herself that she could not\r\nbring herself to dispute it.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, I hate _you_!\" she said, giving the conversation another\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\"Why? In the name of goodness, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"How dared you make a fool of me in your father's office that morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a sudden inspiration. I had to do something to make you think\r\nwell of me, and I thought it might meet the case if I saved you from a\r\nlunatic with a pistol. It wasn't my fault that you found out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forgive you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not Cornwall?\" said Sam. \"The Riviera of England! Let's go to\r\nCornwall. I beg your pardon. What were you saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I should never forgive you and I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope you're fond of motoring,\" said Sam, \"because we're going\r\non till you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well! Go on, then!\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to. Of course, it's all right now while it's dark. But have\r\nyou considered what is going to happen when the sun gets up? We shall\r\nhave a sort of triumphal procession. How the small boys will laugh when\r\nthey see a man in a helmet go by in a car! I shan't notice them myself\r\nbecause it's a little difficult to notice anything from inside this\r\nthing, but I'm afraid it will be rather unpleasant for you ... I know\r\nwhat we'll do. We'll go to London and drive up and down Piccadilly!\r\nThat will be fun!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n\"Is my helmet on straight?\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nBillie made no reply. She was looking before her down the hedge-bordered\r\nroad. Always a girl of sudden impulse, she had just made a curious\r\ndiscovery, to wit, that she was enjoying herself. There was something\r\nso novel and exhilarating about this midnight ride that imperceptibly\r\nher dismay and resentment had ebbed away. She found herself struggling\r\nwith a desire to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Lochinvar!\" said Sam suddenly. \"That's the name of the chap I've been\r\ntrying to think of! Did you ever read about Lochinvar? 'Young\r\nLochinvar' the poet calls him rather familiarly. He did just what I'm\r\ndoing now, and everybody thought very highly of him. I suppose in those\r\ndays a helmet was just an ordinary part of what the well-dressed man\r\nshould wear. Odd how fashions change!\"\r\n\r\nTill now dignity and wrath combined had kept Billie from making any\r\nenquiries into a matter which had excited in her a quite painful\r\ncuriosity. In her new mood she resisted the impulse no longer.\r\n\r\n\"_Why_ are you wearing that thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you. Purely and simply because I can't get it off. You don't\r\nsuppose I'm trying to set a new style in gents' headwear, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did you ever put it on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was this way. After I came out of the cupboard in the\r\ndrawing-room....\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you about that? Oh yes, I was sitting in the cupboard in\r\nthe drawing-room from dinner-time onwards. After that I came out and\r\nstarted cannoning about among Aunt Adeline's china, so I thought I'd\r\nbetter switch the light on. Unfortunately I switched on some sort of\r\nmusical instrument instead. And then somebody started shooting. So,\r\nwhat with one thing and another, I thought it would be best to hide\r\nsomewhere. I hid in one of the suits of armour in the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you inside there all the time we were...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I say, that was funny about Bream, wasn't it? Getting under the\r\nbed, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let's talk about Bream.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the right spirit! I like to see it! All right, we won't. Let's\r\nget back to the main issue. Will you marry me?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did you come to the house at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"To see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To see me! At that time of night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps not actually to see you.\" Sam was a little perplexed for\r\na moment. Something told him that it would be injudicious to reveal his\r\ntrue motive and thereby risk disturbing the harmony which he felt had\r\nbegun to exist between them. \"To be near you! To be in the same house\r\nwith you!\" he went on vehemently feeling that he had struck the right\r\nnote. \"You don't know the anguish I went through after I read that\r\nletter of yours. I was mad! I was ... well, to return to the point,\r\nwill you marry me?\"\r\n\r\nBillie sat looking straight before her. The car, now on the main road,\r\nmoved smoothly on.\r\n\r\n\"Will you marry me?\"\r\n\r\nBillie rested her hand on her chin and searched the darkness with\r\nthoughtful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Will you marry me?\"\r\n\r\nThe car raced on.\r\n\r\n\"Will you marry me?\" said Sam. \"Will you marry me? Will you marry me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't talk like a parrot,\" cried Billie. \"It reminds me of Bream.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\nSam brought the car to a standstill with a jerk, probably very bad for\r\nthe tires.\r\n\r\n\"Did you say 'yes'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Darling!\" said Sam, leaning towards her, \"Oh, curse this helmet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I rather wanted to kiss you and it hampers me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me try and get it off. Bend down!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ouch!\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"It's coming. There! How helpless men are!\"\r\n\r\n\"We need a woman's tender care,\" said Sam depositing the helmet on the\r\nfloor of the car, and rubbing his smarting ears. \"Billie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam!\"\r\n\r\n\"You angel!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're rather a darling after all,\" said Billie. \"But you want keeping\r\nin order,\" she added severely.\r\n\r\n\"You will do that when we're married. When we're married!\" he repeated\r\nluxuriously. \"How splendid it sounds!\"\r\n\r\n\"The only trouble is,\" said Billie, \"father won't hear of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he won't. Not till it is all over,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe started the car again.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" said Billie. \"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To London,\" said Sam. \"It may be news to you but the old lawyer like\r\nmyself knows that, by going to Doctors' Commons or the Court of Arches\r\nor somewhere or by routing the Archbishop of Canterbury out of bed or\r\nsomething, you can get a special license and be married almost before\r\nyou know where you are. My scheme--roughly--is to dig this special\r\nlicense out of whoever keeps such things, have a bit of breakfast, and\r\nthen get married at our leisure before lunch at a registrar's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not a registrar's!\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hate a registrar's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, angel. Just as you say. We'll go to a church. There are\r\nmillions of churches in London. I've seen them all over the place.\" He\r\nmused for a moment. \"Yes, you're quite right,\" he said. \"A church is\r\nthe thing. It'll please Webster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Webster?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's rather keen on the church bells never having rung out so\r\nblithe a peal before. And we must consider Webster's feelings. After\r\nall, he brought us together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Webster? How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll tell you all about that some other time,\" said Sam. \"Just for\r\nthe moment I want to sit quite still and think. Are you comfortable?\r\nFine! Then off we go.\"\r\n\r\nThe birds in the trees fringing the road stirred and twittered grumpily\r\nas the noise of the engine disturbed their slumbers. But, if they had\r\nknown it, they were in luck. At any rate, the worst had not befallen\r\nthem, for Sam was too happy to sing.\r\n\r\nTHE END"
