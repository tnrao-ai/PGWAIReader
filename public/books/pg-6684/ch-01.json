Wodehouse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a day in June, at the hour when London moves abroad in quest\r\nof lunch, a young man stood at the entrance of the Bandolero\r\nRestaurant looking earnestly up Shaftesbury Avenue--a large young\r\nman in excellent condition, with a pleasant, good-humoured, brown,\r\nclean-cut face. He paid no attention to the stream of humanity\r\nthat flowed past him. His mouth was set and his eyes wore a\r\nserious, almost a wistful expression. He was frowning slightly.\r\nOne would have said that here was a man with a secret sorrow.\r\n\r\nWilliam FitzWilliam Delamere Chalmers, Lord Dawlish, had no secret\r\nsorrow. All that he was thinking of at that moment was the best\r\nmethod of laying a golf ball dead in front of the Palace Theatre.\r\nIt was his habit to pass the time in mental golf when Claire\r\nFenwick was late in keeping her appointments with him. On one\r\noccasion she had kept him waiting so long that he had been able to\r\ndo nine holes, starting at the Savoy Grill and finishing up near\r\nHammersmith. His was a simple mind, able to amuse itself with\r\nsimple things.\r\n\r\nAs he stood there, gazing into the middle distance, an individual\r\nof dishevelled aspect sidled up, a vagrant of almost the maximum\r\nseediness, from whose midriff there protruded a trayful of a\r\nstrange welter of collar-studs, shoe-laces, rubber rings,\r\nbuttonhooks, and dying roosters. For some minutes he had been\r\neyeing his lordship appraisingly from the edge of the kerb, and\r\nnow, secure in the fact that there seemed to be no policeman in\r\nthe immediate vicinity, he anchored himself in front of him and\r\nobserved that he had a wife and four children at home, all\r\nstarving.\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing was always happening to Lord Dawlish. There was\r\nsomething about him, some atmosphere of unaffected kindliness,\r\nthat invited it.\r\n\r\nIn these days when everything, from the shape of a man's hat to\r\nhis method of dealing with asparagus, is supposed to be an index\r\nto character, it is possible to form some estimate of Lord Dawlish\r\nfrom the fact that his vigil in front of the Bandolero had been\r\nexpensive even before the advent of the Benedict with the studs\r\nand laces. In London, as in New York, there are spots where it is\r\nunsafe for a man of yielding disposition to stand still, and the\r\ncorner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Piccadilly Circus is one of them.\r\nScrubby, impecunious men drift to and fro there, waiting for the\r\ngods to provide something easy; and the prudent man, conscious of\r\nthe possession of loose change, whizzes through the danger zone at\r\nhis best speed, 'like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in\r\nfear and dread, and having once turned round walks on, and turns\r\nno more his head, because he knows a frightful fiend doth close\r\nbehind him tread.' In the seven minutes he had been waiting two\r\nfrightful fiends closed in on Lord Dawlish, requesting loans of\r\nfive shillings till Wednesday week and Saturday week respectively,\r\nand he had parted with the money without a murmur.\r\n\r\nA further clue to his character is supplied by the fact that both\r\nthese needy persons seemed to know him intimately, and that each\r\ncalled him Bill. All Lord Dawlish's friends called him Bill, and\r\nhe had a catholic list of them, ranging from men whose names were\r\nin 'Debrett' to men whose names were on the notice boards of\r\nobscure clubs in connexion with the non-payment of dues. He was\r\nthe sort of man one instinctively calls Bill.\r\n\r\nThe anti-race-suicide enthusiast with the rubber rings did not call\r\nLord Dawlish Bill, but otherwise his manner was intimate. His\r\nlordship's gaze being a little slow in returning from the middle\r\ndistance--for it was not a matter to be decided carelessly and\r\nwithout thought, this problem of carrying the length of Shaftesbury\r\nAvenue with a single brassy shot--he repeated the gossip from the\r\nhome. Lord Dawlish regarded him thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'It could be done,' he said, 'but you'd want a bit of pull on it.\r\nI'm sorry; I didn't catch what you said.'\r\n\r\nThe other obliged with his remark for the third time, with\r\nincreased pathos, for constant repetition was making him almost\r\nbelieve it himself.\r\n\r\n'Four starving children?'\r\n\r\n'Four, guv'nor, so help me!'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you don't get much time for golf then, what?' said Lord\r\nDawlish, sympathetically.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely three days, said the man, mournfully inflating a\r\ndying rooster, since his offspring had tasted bread.\r\n\r\nThis did not touch Lord Dawlish deeply. He was not very fond of\r\nbread. But it seemed to be troubling the poor fellow with the\r\nstuds a great deal, so, realizing that tastes differ and that\r\nthere is no accounting for them, he looked at him commiseratingly.\r\n\r\n'Of course, if they like bread, that makes it rather rotten,\r\ndoesn't it? What are you going to do about it?'\r\n\r\n'Buy a dying rooster, guv'nor,' he advised. 'Causes great fun and\r\nlaughter.'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish eyed the strange fowl without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said, with a slight shudder.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The situation had the appearance of being at a\r\ndeadlock.\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you what,' said Lord Dawlish, with the air of one who,\r\nhaving pondered, has been rewarded with a great idea: 'the fact\r\nis, I really don't want to buy anything. You seem by bad luck to\r\nbe stocked up with just the sort of things I wouldn't be seen dead\r\nin a ditch with. I can't stand rubber rings, never could. I'm not\r\nreally keen on buttonhooks. And I don't want to hurt your\r\nfeelings, but I think that squeaking bird of yours is about the\r\nbeastliest thing I ever met. So suppose I give you a shilling and\r\ncall it square, what?'\r\n\r\n'Gawd bless yer, guv'nor.'\r\n\r\n'Not at all. You'll be able to get those children of yours some\r\nbread--I expect you can get a lot of bread for a shilling. Do they\r\nreally like it? Rum kids!'\r\n\r\nAnd having concluded this delicate financial deal Lord Dawlish\r\nturned, the movement bringing him face to face with a tall girl in\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nDuring the business talk which had just come to an end this girl\r\nhad been making her way up the side street which forms a short cut\r\nbetween Coventry Street and the Bandolero, and several admirers of\r\nfeminine beauty who happened to be using the same route had almost\r\ndislocated their necks looking after her. She was a strikingly\r\nhandsome girl. She was tall and willowy. Her eyes, shaded by her\r\nhat, were large and grey. Her nose was small and straight, her\r\nmouth, though somewhat hard, admirably shaped, and she carried\r\nherself magnificently. One cannot blame the policeman on duty in\r\nLeicester Square for remarking to a cabman as she passed that he\r\nenvied the bloke that that was going to meet.\r\n\r\nBill Dawlish was this fortunate bloke, but, from the look of him\r\nas he caught sight of her, one would have said that he did not\r\nappreciate his luck. The fact of the matter was that he had only\r\njust finished giving the father of the family his shilling, and he\r\nwas afraid that Claire had seen him doing it. For Claire, dear\r\ngirl, was apt to be unreasonable about these little generosities\r\nof his. He cast a furtive glance behind him in the hope that the\r\ndisseminator of expiring roosters had vanished, but the man was\r\nstill at his elbow. Worse, he faced them, and in a hoarse but\r\ncarrying voice he was instructing Heaven to bless his benefactor.\r\n\r\n'Halloa, Claire darling!' said Lord Dawlish, with a sort of\r\nsheepish breeziness. 'Here you are.'\r\n\r\nClaire was looking after the stud merchant, as, grasping his\r\nwealth, he scuttled up the avenue.\r\n\r\n'Only a bob,' his lordship hastened to say. 'Rather a sad case,\r\ndon't you know. Squads of children at home demanding bread. Didn't\r\nwant much else, apparently, but were frightfully keen on bread.'\r\n\r\n'He has just gone into a public-house.'\r\n\r\n'He may have gone to telephone or something, what?'\r\n\r\n'I wish,' said Claire, fretfully, leading the way down the\r\ngrillroom stairs, 'that you wouldn't let all London sponge on you\r\nlike this. I keep telling you not to. I should have thought that\r\nif any one needed to keep what little money he has got it was\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nCertainly Lord Dawlish would have been more prudent not to have\r\nparted with even eleven shillings, for he was not a rich man.\r\nIndeed, with the single exception of the Earl of Wetherby, whose\r\nfinances were so irregular that he could not be said to possess an\r\nincome at all, he was the poorest man of his rank in the British\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nIt was in the days of the Regency that the Dawlish coffers first\r\nbegan to show signs of cracking under the strain, in the era of\r\nthe then celebrated Beau Dawlish. Nor were his successors backward\r\nin the spending art. A breezy disregard for the preservation of\r\nthe pence was a family trait. Bill was at Cambridge when his\r\npredecessor in the title, his Uncle Philip, was performing the\r\nconcluding exercises of the dissipation of the Dawlish doubloons,\r\na feat which he achieved so neatly that when he died there was\r\njust enough cash to pay the doctors, and no more. Bill found\r\nhimself the possessor of that most ironical thing, a moneyless\r\ntitle. He was then twenty-three.\r\n\r\nUntil six months before, when he had become engaged to Claire\r\nFenwick, he had found nothing to quarrel with in his lot. He was\r\nnot the type to waste time in vain regrets. His tastes were\r\nsimple. As long as he could afford to belong to one or two golf\r\nclubs and have something over for those small loans which, in\r\ncertain of the numerous circles in which he moved, were the\r\ninevitable concomitant of popularity, he was satisfied. And this\r\nmodest ambition had been realized for him by a group of what he\r\nwas accustomed to refer to as decent old bucks, who had installed\r\nhim as secretary of that aristocratic and exclusive club, Brown's\r\nin St James Street, at an annual salary of four hundred pounds.\r\nWith that wealth, added to free lodging at one of the best clubs\r\nin London, perfect health, a steadily-diminishing golf handicap,\r\nand a host of friends in every walk of life, Bill had felt that it\r\nwould be absurd not to be happy and contented.\r\n\r\nBut Claire had made a difference. There was no question of that.\r\nIn the first place, she resolutely declined to marry him on four\r\nhundred pounds a year. She scoffed at four hundred pounds a year.\r\nTo hear her talk, you would have supposed that she had been\r\nbrought up from the cradle to look on four hundred pounds a year\r\nas small change to be disposed of in tips and cab fares. That in\r\nitself would have been enough to sow doubts in Bill's mind as to\r\nwhether he had really got all the money that a reasonable man\r\nneeded; and Claire saw to it that these doubts sprouted, by\r\nconfining her conversation on the occasions of their meeting\r\nalmost entirely to the great theme of money, with its minor\r\nsub-divisions of How to Get It, Why Don't You Get It? and I'm Sick\r\nand Tired of Not Having It.\r\n\r\nShe developed this theme to-day, not only on the stairs leading to\r\nthe grillroom, but even after they had seated themselves at their\r\ntable. It was a relief to Bill when the arrival of the waiter with\r\nfood caused a break in the conversation and enabled him adroitly\r\nto change the subject.\r\n\r\n'What have you been doing this morning?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'I went to see Maginnis at the theatre.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!'\r\n\r\n'I had a wire from him asking me to call. They want me to take up\r\nClaudia Winslow's part in the number one company.'\r\n\r\n'That's good.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Well--er--what I mean--well, isn't it? What I mean is, leading\r\npart, and so forth.'\r\n\r\n'In a touring company?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I see what you mean,' said Lord Dawlish, who didn't at all.\r\nHe thought rather highly of the number one companies that hailed\r\nfrom the theatre of which Mr Maginnis was proprietor.\r\n\r\n'And anyhow, I ought to have had the part in the first place\r\ninstead of when the tour's half over. They are at Southampton this\r\nweek. He wants me to join them there and go on to Portsmouth with\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n'You'll like Portsmouth.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Well--er--good links quite near.'\r\n\r\n'You know I don't play golf.'\r\n\r\n'Nor do you. I was forgetting. Still, it's quite a jolly place.'\r\n\r\n'It's a horrible place. I loathe it. I've half a mind not to go.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish was feeling a little sorry for himself. Whatever he\r\nsaid seemed to be the wrong thing. This evidently was one of the\r\ndays on which Claire was not so sweet-tempered as on some other\r\ndays. It crossed his mind that of late these irritable moods of\r\nhers had grown more frequent. It was not her fault, poor girl! he\r\ntold himself. She had rather a rotten time.\r\n\r\nIt was always Lord Dawlish's habit on these occasions to make this\r\nexcuse for Claire. It was such a satisfactory excuse. It covered\r\neverything. But, as a matter of fact, the rather rotten time which\r\nshe was having was not such a very rotten one. Reducing it to its\r\nsimplest terms, and forgetting for the moment that she was an\r\nextraordinarily beautiful girl--which his lordship found it\r\nimpossible to do--all that it amounted to was that, her mother\r\nhaving but a small income, and existence in the West Kensington\r\nflat being consequently a trifle dull for one with a taste for the\r\nluxuries of life, Claire had gone on the stage. By birth she\r\nbelonged to a class of which the female members are seldom called\r\nupon to earn money at all, and that was one count of her grievance\r\nagainst Fate. Another was that she had not done as well on the\r\nstage as she had expected to do. When she became engaged to Bill\r\nshe had reached a point where she could obtain without difficulty\r\ngood parts in the touring companies of London successes, but\r\nbeyond that it seemed it was impossible for her to soar. It was\r\nnot, perhaps, a very exhilarating life, but, except to the eyes of\r\nlove, there was nothing tragic about it. It was the cumulative\r\neffect of having a mother in reduced circumstances and grumbling\r\nabout it, of being compelled to work and grumbling about that, and\r\nof achieving in her work only a semi-success and grumbling about\r\nthat also, that--backed by her looks--enabled Claire to give quite\r\na number of people, and Bill Dawlish in particular, the impression\r\nthat she was a modern martyr, only sustained by her indomitable\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nSo Bill, being requested in a peevish voice to explain what he\r\nmeant by saying, 'Oh, I don't know,' condoned the peevishness. He\r\nthen bent his mind to the task of trying to ascertain what he had\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he said, 'what I mean is, if you don't show up won't it be\r\nrather a jar for old friend Maginnis? Won't he be apt to foam at\r\nthe mouth a bit and stop giving you parts in his companies?'\r\n\r\n'I'm sick of trying to please Maginnis. What's the good? He never\r\ngives me a chance in London. I'm sick of being always on tour. I'm\r\nsick of everything.'\r\n\r\n'It's the heat,' said Lord Dawlish, most injudiciously.\r\n\r\n'It isn't the heat. It's you!'\r\n\r\n'Me? What have I done?'\r\n\r\n'It's what you've not done. Why can't you exert yourself and make\r\nsome money?'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish groaned a silent groan. By a devious route, but with\r\nunfailing precision, they had come homing back to the same old\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n'We have been engaged for six months, and there seems about as\r\nmuch chance of our ever getting married as of--I can't think of\r\nanything unlikely enough. We shall go on like this till we're\r\ndead.'\r\n\r\n'But, my dear girl!'\r\n\r\n'I wish you wouldn't talk to me as if you were my grandfather.\r\nWhat were you going to say?'\r\n\r\n'Only that we can get married this afternoon if you'll say the\r\nword.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't let us go into all that again! I'm not going to marry\r\non four hundred a year and spend the rest of my life in a pokey\r\nlittle flat on the edge of London. Why can't you make more money?'\r\n\r\n'I did have a dash at it, you know. I waylaid old Bodger--Colonel\r\nBodger, on the committee of the club, you know--and suggested over\r\na whisky-and-soda that the management of Brown's would be behaving\r\nlike sportsmen if they bumped my salary up a bit, and the old boy\r\nnearly strangled himself trying to suck down Scotch and laugh at\r\nthe same time. I give you my word, he nearly expired on the\r\nsmoking-room floor. When he came to he said that he wished I\r\nwouldn't spring my good things on him so suddenly, as he had a\r\nweak heart. He said they were only paying me my present salary\r\nbecause they liked me so much. You know, it was decent of the old\r\nboy to say that.'\r\n\r\n'What is the good of being liked by the men in your club if you\r\nwon't make any use of it?'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'There are endless things you could do. You could have got Mr\r\nBreitstein elected at Brown's if you had liked. They wouldn't have\r\ndreamed of blackballing any one proposed by a popular man like you,\r\nand Mr Breitstein asked you personally to use your influence--you\r\ntold me so.'\r\n\r\n'But, my dear girl--I mean my darling--Breitstein! He's the limit!\r\nHe's the worst bounder in London.'\r\n\r\n'He's also one of the richest men in London. He would have done\r\nanything for you. And you let him go! You insulted him!'\r\n\r\n'Insulted him?'\r\n\r\n'Didn't you send him an admission ticket to the Zoo?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, yes, I did do that. He thanked me and went the\r\nfollowing Sunday. Amazing how these rich Johnnies love getting\r\nsomething for nothing. There was that old American I met down at\r\nMarvis Bay last year--'\r\n\r\n'You threw away a wonderful chance of making all sorts of money.\r\nWhy, a single tip from Mr Breitstein would have made your\r\nfortune.'\r\n\r\n'But, Claire, you know, there are some things--what I mean is, if\r\nthey like me at Brown's, it's awfully decent of them and all that,\r\nbut I couldn't take advantage of it to plant a fellow like\r\nBreitstein on them. It wouldn't be playing the game.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, nonsense!'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish looked unhappy, but said nothing. This matter of Mr\r\nBreitstein had been touched upon by Claire in previous conversations,\r\nand it was a subject for which he had little liking. Experience had\r\ntaught him that none of the arguments which seemed so conclusive\r\nto him--to wit, that the financier had on two occasions only just\r\nescaped imprisonment for fraud, and, what was worse, made a\r\nnoise when he drank soup, like water running out of a bathtub--had\r\nthe least effect upon her. The only thing to do when Mr Breitstein\r\ncame up in the course of chitchat over the festive board was to\r\nstay quiet until he blew over.\r\n\r\n'That old American you met at Marvis Bay,' said Claire, her memory\r\nflitting back to the remark which she had interrupted; 'well,\r\nthere's another case. You could easily have got him to do\r\nsomething for you.'\r\n\r\n'Claire, really!' said his goaded lordship, protestingly. 'How on\r\nearth? I only met the man on the links.'\r\n\r\n'But you were very nice to him. You told me yourself that you\r\nspent hours helping him to get rid of his slice, whatever that\r\nis.'\r\n\r\n'We happened to be the only two down there at the time, so I was\r\nas civil as I could manage. If you're marooned at a Cornish\r\nseaside resort out of the season with a man, you can't spend your\r\ntime dodging him. And this man had a slice that fascinated me. I\r\nfelt at the time that it was my mission in life to cure him, so I\r\nhad a dash at it. But I don't see how on the strength of that I\r\ncould expect the old boy to adopt me. He probably forgot my\r\nexistence after I had left.'\r\n\r\n'You said you met him in London a month or two afterwards, and he\r\nhadn't forgotten you.'\r\n\r\n'Well, yes, that's true. He was walking up the Haymarket and I was\r\nwalking down. I caught his eye, and he nodded and passed on. I\r\ndon't see how I could construe that into an invitation to go and\r\nsit on his lap and help myself out of his pockets.'\r\n\r\n'You couldn't expect him to go out of his way to help you; but\r\nprobably if you had gone to him he would have done something.'\r\n\r\n'You haven't the pleasure of Mr Ira Nutcombe's acquaintance,\r\nClaire, or you wouldn't talk like that. He wasn't the sort of man\r\nyou could get things out of. He didn't even tip the caddie.\r\nBesides, can't you see what I mean? I couldn't trade on a chance\r\nacquaintance of the golf links to--'\r\n\r\n'That is just what I complain of in you. You're too diffident.'\r\n\r\n'It isn't diffidence exactly. Talking of old Nutcombe, I was\r\nspeaking to Gates again the other night. He was telling me about\r\nAmerica. There's a lot of money to be made over there, you know,\r\nand the committee owes me a holiday. They would give me a few\r\nweeks off any time I liked.\r\n\r\n'What do you say? Shall I pop over and have a look round? I might\r\nhappen to drop into something. Gates was telling me about fellows\r\nhe knew who had dropped into things in New York.'\r\n\r\n'What's the good of putting yourself to all the trouble and\r\nexpense of going to America? You can easily make all you want in\r\nLondon if you will only try. It isn't as if you had no chances.\r\nYou have more chances than almost any man in town. With your title\r\nyou could get all the directorships in the City that you wanted.'\r\n\r\n'Well, the fact is, this business of taking directorships has\r\nnever quite appealed to me. I don't know anything about the game,\r\nand I should probably run up against some wildcat company. I can't\r\nsay I like the directorship wheeze much. It's the idea of knowing\r\nthat one's name would be being used as a bait. Every time I saw it\r\non a prospectus I should feel like a trout fly.'\r\n\r\nClaire bit her lip.\r\n\r\n'It's so exasperating!' she broke out. 'When I first told my\r\nfriends that I was engaged to Lord Dawlish they were tremendously\r\nimpressed. They took it for granted that you must have lots of\r\nmoney. Now I have to keep explaining to them that the reason we\r\ndon't get married is that we can't afford to. I'm almost as badly\r\noff as poor Polly Davis who was in the Heavenly Waltz Company with\r\nme when she married that man, Lord Wetherby. A man with a title\r\nhas no right not to have money. It makes the whole thing farcical.\r\n\r\n'If I were in your place I should have tried a hundred things by\r\nnow, but you always have some silly objection. Why couldn't you,\r\nfor instance, have taken on the agency of that what-d'you-call-it\r\ncar?'\r\n\r\n'What I called it would have been nothing to what the poor devils\r\nwho bought it would have called it.'\r\n\r\n'You could have sold hundreds of them, and the company would have\r\ngiven you any commission you asked. You know just the sort of\r\npeople they wanted to get in touch with.'\r\n\r\n'But, darling, how could I? Planting Breitstein on the club would\r\nhave been nothing compared with sowing these horrors about London.\r\nI couldn't go about the place sticking my pals with a car which, I\r\ngive you my honest word, was stuck together with chewing-gum and\r\ntied up with string.'\r\n\r\n'Why not? It would be their fault if they bought a car that wasn't\r\nany good. Why should you have to worry once you had it sold?'\r\n\r\nIt was not Lord Dawlish's lucky afternoon. All through lunch he\r\nhad been saying the wrong thing, and now he put the coping-stone\r\non his misdeeds. Of all the ways in which he could have answered\r\nClaire's question he chose the worst.\r\n\r\n'Er--well,' he said, '_noblesse oblige_, don't you know, what?'\r\n\r\nFor a moment Claire did not speak. Then she looked at her watch\r\nand got up.\r\n\r\n'I must be going,' she said, coldly.\r\n\r\n'But you haven't had your coffee yet.'\r\n\r\n'I don't want any coffee.'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter, dear?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing is the matter. I have to go home and pack. I'm going to\r\nSouthampton this afternoon.'\r\n\r\nShe began to move towards the door. Lord Dawlish, anxious to\r\nfollow, was detained by the fact that he had not yet paid the\r\nbill. The production and settling of this took time, and when\r\nfinally he turned in search of Claire she was nowhere visible.\r\n\r\nBounding upstairs on the swift feet of love, he reached the\r\nstreet. She had gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nA grey sadness surged over Bill Dawlish. The sun hid itself behind\r\na cloud, the sky took on a leaden hue, and a chill wind blew\r\nthrough the world. He scanned Shaftesbury Avenue with a jaundiced\r\neye, and thought that he had never seen a beastlier thoroughfare.\r\nPiccadilly, however, into which he shortly dragged himself, was\r\neven worse. It was full of men and women and other depressing\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nHe pitied himself profoundly. It was a rotten world to live in,\r\nthis, where a fellow couldn't say _noblesse oblige_ without\r\nupsetting the universe. Why shouldn't a fellow say _noblesse\r\noblige?_ Why--? At this juncture Lord Dawlish walked into a\r\nlamp-post.\r\n\r\nThe shock changed his mood. Gloom still obsessed him, but blended\r\nnow with remorse. He began to look at the matter from Claire's\r\nviewpoint, and his pity switched from himself to her. In the first\r\nplace, the poor girl had rather a rotten time. Could she be blamed\r\nfor wanting him to make money? No. Yet whenever she made suggestions\r\nas to how the thing was to be done, he snubbed her by saying\r\n_noblesse oblige_. Naturally a refined and sensitive young girl\r\nobjected to having things like _noblesse oblige_ said to her. Where\r\nwas the sense in saying _noblesse oblige_? Such a confoundedly silly\r\nthing to say. Only a perfect ass would spend his time rushing about\r\nthe place saying _noblesse oblige_ to people.\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' Lord Dawlish stopped in his stride. He disentangled\r\nhimself from a pedestrian who had rammed him on the back. 'I'll do\r\nit!'\r\n\r\nHe hailed a passing taxi and directed the driver to make for the\r\nPen and Ink Club.\r\n\r\nThe decision at which Bill had arrived with such dramatic\r\nsuddenness in the middle of Piccadilly was the same at which some\r\ncenturies earlier Columbus had arrived in the privacy of his home.\r\n\r\n'Hang it!' said Bill to himself in the cab, 'I'll go to America!'\r\nThe exact words probably which Columbus had used, talking the\r\nthing over with his wife.\r\n\r\nBill's knowledge of the great republic across the sea was at this\r\nperiod of his life a little sketchy. He knew that there had been\r\nunpleasantness between England and the United States in\r\nseventeen-something and again in eighteen-something, but that\r\nthings had eventually been straightened out by Miss Edna May\r\nand her fellow missionaries of the Belle of New York Company,\r\nsince which time there had been no more trouble. Of American\r\ncocktails he had a fair working knowledge, and he appreciated\r\nragtime. But of the other great American institutions he was\r\ncompletely ignorant.\r\n\r\nHe was on his way now to see Gates. Gates was a comparatively\r\nrecent addition to his list of friends, a New York newspaperman\r\nwho had come to England a few months before to act as his paper's\r\nLondon correspondent. He was generally to be found at the Pen and\r\nInk Club, an institution affiliated with the New York Players, of\r\nwhich he was a member.\r\n\r\nGates was in. He had just finished lunch.\r\n\r\n'What's the trouble, Bill?' he inquired, when he had deposited his\r\nlordship in a corner of the reading-room, which he had selected\r\nbecause silence was compulsory there, thus rendering it possible\r\nfor two men to hear each other speak. 'What brings you charging in\r\nhere looking like the Soul's Awakening?'\r\n\r\n'I've had an idea, old man.'\r\n\r\n'Proceed. Continue.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! Well, you remember what you were saying about America?'\r\n\r\n'What was I saying about America?'\r\n\r\n'The other day, don't you remember? What a lot of money there was\r\nto be made there and so forth.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going there.'\r\n\r\n'To America?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'To make money?'\r\n\r\n'Rather.'\r\n\r\nGates nodded--sadly, it seemed to Bill. He was rather a melancholy\r\nyoung man, with a long face not unlike a pessimistic horse.\r\n\r\n'Gosh!' he said.\r\n\r\nBill felt a little damped. By no mental juggling could he construe\r\n'Gosh!' into an expression of enthusiastic approbation.\r\n\r\nGates looked at Bill curiously. 'What's the idea?' he said. 'I\r\ncould have understood it if you had told me that you were going to\r\nNew York for pleasure, instructing your man Willoughby to see that\r\nthe trunks were jolly well packed and wiring to the skipper of\r\nyour yacht to meet you at Liverpool. But you seem to have sordid\r\nmotives. You talk about making money. What do you want with more\r\nmoney?'\r\n\r\n'Why, I'm devilish hard up.'\r\n\r\n'Tenantry a bit slack with the rent?' said Gates sympathetically.\r\n\r\nBill laughed.\r\n\r\n'My dear chap, I don't know what on earth you're talking about.\r\nHow much money do you think I've got? Four hundred pounds a year,\r\nand no prospect of ever making more unless I sweat for it.'\r\n\r\n'What! I always thought you were rolling in money.'\r\n\r\n'What gave you that idea?'\r\n\r\n'You have a prosperous look. It's a funny thing about England.\r\nI've known you four months, and I know men who know you; but I've\r\nnever heard a word about your finances. In New York we all wear\r\nlabels, stating our incomes and prospects in clear lettering.\r\nWell, if it's like that it's different, of course. There certainly\r\nis more money to be made in America than here. I don't quite see\r\nwhat you think you're going to do when you get there, but that's\r\nup to you.\r\n\r\n'There's no harm in giving the city a trial. Anyway, I can give\r\nyou a letter or two that might help.'\r\n\r\n'That's awfully good of you.'\r\n\r\n'You won't mind my alluding to you as my friend William Smith?'\r\n\r\n'William Smith?'\r\n\r\n'You can't travel under your own name if you are really serious\r\nabout getting a job. Mind you, if my letters lead to anything it\r\nwill probably be a situation as an earnest bill-clerk or an\r\neffervescent office-boy, for Rockefeller and Carnegie and that lot\r\nhave swiped all the soft jobs. But if you go over as Lord Dawlish\r\nyou won't even get that. Lords are popular socially in America,\r\nbut are not used to any great extent in the office. If you try to\r\nbreak in under your right name you'll get the glad hand and be\r\nasked to stay here and there and play a good deal of golf and\r\ndance quite a lot, but you won't get a job. A gentle smile will\r\ngreet all your pleadings that you be allowed to come in and save\r\nthe firm.'\r\n\r\n'I see.'\r\n\r\n'We may look on Smith as a necessity.'\r\n\r\n'Do you know, I'm not frightfully keen on the name Smith. Wouldn't\r\nsomething else do?'\r\n\r\n'Sure. We aim to please. How would Jones suit you?'\r\n\r\n'The trouble is, you know, that if I took a name I wasn't used to\r\nI might forget it.'\r\n\r\n'If you've the sort of mind that would forget Jones I doubt if\r\never you'll be a captain of industry.'\r\n\r\n'Why not Chalmers?'\r\n\r\n'You think it easier to memorize than Jones?'\r\n\r\n'It used to be my name, you see, before I got the title.'\r\n\r\n'I see. All right. Chalmers then. When do you think of starting?'\r\n\r\n'To-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'You aren't losing much time. By the way, as you're going to New\r\nYork you might as well use my flat.'\r\n\r\n'It's awfully good of you.'\r\n\r\n'Not a bit. You would be doing me a favour. I had to leave at a\r\nmoment's notice, and I want to know what's been happening to the\r\nplace. I left some Japanese prints there, and my favourite\r\nnightmare is that someone has broken in and sneaked them. Write\r\ndown the address--Forty-three East Twenty-seventh Street. I'll\r\nsend you the key to Brown's to-night with those letters.'\r\n\r\nBill walked up the Strand, glowing with energy. He made his way to\r\nCockspur Street to buy his ticket for New York. This done, he set\r\nout to Brown's to arrange with the committee the details of his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nHe reached Brown's at twenty minutes past two and left it again at\r\ntwenty-three minutes past; for, directly he entered, the hall\r\nporter had handed him a telephone message. The telephone\r\nattendants at London clubs are masters of suggestive brevity. The\r\none in the basement of Brown's had written on Bill's slip of paper\r\nthe words: '1 p.m. Will Lord Dawlish as soon as possible call upon\r\nMr Gerald Nichols at his office?' To this was appended a message\r\nconsisting of two words: 'Good news.'\r\n\r\nIt was stimulating. The probability was that all Jerry Nichols\r\nwanted to tell him was that he had received stable information\r\nabout some horse or had been given a box for the Empire, but for\r\nall that it was stimulating.\r\n\r\nBill looked at his watch. He could spare half an hour. He set out\r\nat once for the offices of the eminent law firm of Nichols,\r\nNichols, Nichols, and Nichols, of which aggregation of Nicholses\r\nhis friend Jerry was the last and smallest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a west-bound omnibus Claire Fenwick sat and raged silently in the\r\nJune sunshine. She was furious. What right had Lord Dawlish to look\r\ndown his nose and murmur '_Noblesse oblige_' when she asked him a\r\nquestion, as if she had suggested that he should commit some crime?\r\nIt was the patronizing way he had said it that infuriated her, as if\r\nhe were a superior being of some kind, governed by codes which she\r\ncould not be expected to understand. Everybody nowadays did the sort\r\nof things she suggested, so what was the good of looking shocked and\r\nsaying '_Noblesse oblige_'?\r\n\r\nThe omnibus rolled on towards West Kensington. Claire hated the\r\nplace with the bitter hate of one who had read society novels, and\r\nyearned for Grosvenor Square and butlers and a general atmosphere\r\nof soft cushions and pink-shaded lights and maids to do one's\r\nhair. She hated the cheap furniture of the little parlour, the\r\npenetrating contralto of the cook singing hymns in the kitchen,\r\nand the ubiquitousness of her small brother. He was only ten, and\r\nsmall for his age, yet he appeared to have the power of being in\r\ntwo rooms at the same time while making a nerve-racking noise in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIt was Percy who greeted her to-day as she entered the flat.\r\n\r\n'Halloa, Claire! I say, Claire, there's a letter for you. It came\r\nby the second post. I say, Claire, it's got an American stamp on\r\nit. Can I have it, Claire? I haven't got one in my collection.'\r\n\r\nHis sister regarded him broodingly. 'For goodness' sake don't\r\nbellow like that!' she said. 'Of course, you can have the stamp. I\r\ndon't want it. Where is the letter?'\r\n\r\nClaire took the envelope from him, extracted the letter, and\r\nhanded back the envelope. Percy vanished into the dining-room with\r\na shattering squeal of pleasure.\r\n\r\nA voice spoke from behind a half-opened door--\r\n\r\n'Is that you, Claire?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, mother; I've come back to pack. They want me to go to\r\nSouthampton to-night to take up Claudia Winslow's part.'\r\n\r\n'What train are you catching?'\r\n\r\n'The three-fifteen.'\r\n\r\n'You will have to hurry.'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to hurry,' said Claire, clenching her fists as two\r\nsimultaneous bursts of song, in different keys and varying tempos,\r\nproceeded from the dining-room and kitchen. A girl has to be in a\r\nsunnier mood than she was to bear up without wincing under the\r\ninfliction of a duet consisting of the Rock of Ages and Waiting\r\nfor the Robert E. Lee. Assuredly Claire proposed to hurry. She\r\nmeant to get her packing done in record time and escape from this\r\nplace. She went into her bedroom and began to throw things\r\nuntidily into her trunk. She had put the letter in her pocket\r\nagainst a more favourable time for perusal. A glance had told her\r\nthat it was from her friend Polly, Countess of Wetherby: that\r\nPolly Davis of whom she had spoken to Lord Dawlish. Polly Davis,\r\nnow married for better or for worse to that curious invertebrate\r\nperson, Algie Wetherby, was the only real friend Claire had made\r\non the stage. A sort of shivering gentility had kept her aloof\r\nfrom the rest of her fellow-workers, but it took more than a\r\nshivering gentility to stave off Polly.\r\n\r\nClaire had passed through the various stages of intimacy with her,\r\nuntil on the occasion of Polly's marriage she had acted as her\r\nbridesmaid.\r\n\r\nIt was a long letter, too long to be read until she was at\r\nleisure, and written in a straggling hand that made reading\r\ndifficult. She was mildly surprised that Polly should have written\r\nher, for she had been back in America a year or more now, and this\r\nwas her first letter. Polly had a warm heart and did not forget\r\nher friends, but she was not a good correspondent.\r\n\r\nThe need of getting her things ready at once drove the letter from\r\nClaire's mind. She was in the train on her way to Southampton\r\nbefore she remembered its existence.\r\n\r\nIt was dated from New York.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR OLD CLAIRE,--Is this really my first letter to you? Isn't\r\nthat awful! Gee! A lot's happened since I saw you last. I must\r\ntell you first about my hit. Some hit! Claire, old girl, I own New\r\nYork. I daren't tell you what my salary is. You'd faint.\r\n\r\nI'm doing barefoot dancing. You know the sort of stuff. I started\r\nit in vaudeville, and went so big that my agent shifted me to the\r\nrestaurants, and they have to call out the police reserves to\r\nhandle the crowd. You can't get a table at Reigelheimer's, which\r\nis my pitch, unless you tip the head waiter a small fortune and\r\npromise to mail him your clothes when you get home. I dance during\r\nsupper with nothing on my feet and not much anywhere else, and it\r\ntakes three vans to carry my salary to the bank.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's the title that does it: 'Lady Pauline Wetherby!'\r\nAlgie says it oughtn't to be that, because I'm not the daughter of\r\na duke, but I don't worry about that. It looks good, and that's\r\nall that matters. You can't get away from the title. I was born in\r\nCarbondale, Illinois, but that doesn't matter--I'm an English\r\ncountess, doing barefoot dancing to work off the mortgage on the\r\nancestral castle, and they eat me. Take it from me, Claire, I'm a\r\nriot.\r\n\r\nWell, that's that. What I am really writing about is to tell you\r\nthat you have got to come over here. I've taken a house at\r\nBrookport, on Long Island, for the summer. You can stay with me\r\ntill the fall, and then I can easily get you a good job in New\r\nYork. I have some pull these days, believe me. Not that you'll\r\nneed my help. The managers have only got to see you and they'll\r\nall want you. I showed one of them that photograph you gave me,\r\nand he went up in the air. They pay twice as big salaries over\r\nhere, you know, as in England, so come by the next boat.\r\n\r\nClaire, darling, you must come. I'm wretched. Algie has got my\r\ngoat the worst way. If you don't know what that means it means\r\nthat he's behaving like a perfect pig. I hardly know where to\r\nbegin. Well, it was this way: directly I made my hit my press\r\nagent, a real bright man named Sherriff, got busy, of course.\r\nInterviews, you know, and Advice to Young Girls in the evening\r\npapers, and How I Preserve My Beauty, and all that sort of thing.\r\nWell, one thing he made me do was to buy a snake and a monkey.\r\nRoscoe Sherriff is crazy about animals as aids to advertisement.\r\nHe says an animal story is the thing he does best. So I bought\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAlgie kicked from the first. I ought to tell you that since we\r\nleft England he has taken up painting footling little pictures,\r\nand has got the artistic temperament badly. All his life he's been\r\nstarting some new fool thing. When I first met him he prided\r\nhimself on having the finest collection of photographs of\r\nrace-horses in England. Then he got a craze for model engines.\r\nAfter that he used to work the piano player till I nearly went\r\ncrazy. And now it's pictures.\r\n\r\nI don't mind his painting. It gives him something to do and keeps\r\nhim out of mischief. He has a studio down in Washington Square,\r\nand is perfectly happy messing about there all day.\r\n\r\nEverything would be fine if he didn't think it necessary to tack\r\non the artistic temperament to his painting. He's developed the\r\nidea that he has nerves and everything upsets them.\r\n\r\nThings came to a head this morning at breakfast. Clarence, my\r\nsnake, has the cutest way of climbing up the leg of the table and\r\nlooking at you pleadingly in the hope that you will give him\r\nsoft-boiled egg, which he adores. He did it this morning, and no\r\nsooner had his head appeared above the table than Algie, with a kind\r\nof sharp wail, struck him a violent blow on the nose with a teaspoon.\r\nThen he turned to me, very pale, and said: 'Pauline, this must\r\nend! The time has come to speak up. A nervous, highly-strung man\r\nlike myself should not, and must not, be called upon to live in a\r\nhouse where he is constantly meeting snakes and monkeys without\r\nwarning. Choose between me and--'\r\n\r\nWe had got as far as this when Eustace, the monkey, who I didn't\r\nknow was in the room at all, suddenly sprang on to his back. He is\r\nvery fond of Algie.\r\n\r\nWould you believe it? Algie walked straight out of the house, still\r\nholding the teaspoon, and has not returned. Later in the day he\r\ncalled me up on the phone and said that, though he realized that a\r\nman's place was the home, he declined to cross the threshold again\r\nuntil I had got rid of Eustace and Clarence. I tried to reason with\r\nhim. I told him that he ought to think himself lucky it wasn't\r\nanything worse than a monkey and a snake, for the last person Roscoe\r\nSherriff handled, an emotional actress named Devenish, had to keep a\r\nyoung puma. But he wouldn't listen, and the end of it was that he\r\nrang off and I have not seen or heard of him since.\r\n\r\nI am broken-hearted. I won't give in, but I am having an awful time.\r\nSo, dearest Claire, do come over and help me. If you could possibly\r\nsail by the _Atlantic_, leaving Southampton on the twenty-fourth of\r\nthis month, you would meet a friend of mine whom I think you would\r\nlike. His name is Dudley Pickering, and he made a fortune in\r\nautomobiles. I expect you have heard of the Pickering automobiles?\r\n\r\nDarling Claire, do come, or I know I shall weaken and yield to\r\nAlgie's outrageous demands, for, though I would like to hit him\r\nwith a brick, I love him dearly.\r\n\r\n  Your affectionate\r\n     POLLY WETHERBY\r\n\r\nClaire sank back against the cushioned seat and her eyes filled\r\nwith tears of disappointment. Of all the things which would have\r\nchimed in with her discontented mood at that moment a sudden\r\nflight to America was the most alluring. Only one consideration\r\nheld her back--she had not the money for her fare.\r\n\r\nPolly might have thought of that, she reflected, bitterly. She\r\ntook the letter up again and saw that on the last page there was a\r\npostscript--\r\n\r\nPS.--I don't know how you are fixed for money, old girl, but if\r\nthings are the same with you as in the old days you can't be\r\nrolling. So I have paid for a passage for you with the liner\r\npeople this side, and they have cabled their English office, so\r\nyou can sail whenever you want to. Come right over.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the manager of the Southampton branch of the White\r\nStar Line was dazzled by an apparition, a beautiful girl who burst\r\nin upon him with flushed face and shining eyes, demanding a berth on\r\nthe steamship _Atlantic_ and talking about a Lady Wetherby. Ten\r\nminutes later, her passage secured, Claire was walking to the local\r\ntheatre to inform those in charge of the destinies of The Girl and\r\nthe Artist number one company that they must look elsewhere for a\r\nsubstitute for Miss Claudia Winslow. Then she went back to her hotel\r\nto write a letter home, notifying her mother of her plans.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch. It was six o'clock. Back in West\r\nKensington a rich smell of dinner would be floating through the\r\nflat; the cook, watching the boiling cabbage, would be singing \"A\r\nFew More Years Shall Roll\"; her mother would be sighing; and her\r\nlittle brother Percy would be employed upon some juvenile\r\ndeviltry, the exact nature of which it was not possible to\r\nconjecture, though one could be certain that it would be something\r\ninvolving a deafening noise.\r\n\r\nClaire smiled a happy smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe offices of Messrs Nichols, Nichols, Nichols, and Nichols were\r\nin Lincoln's Inn Fields. The first Nichols had been dead since the\r\nreign of King William the Fourth, the second since the jubilee\r\nyear of Queen Victoria. The remaining brace were Lord Dawlish's\r\nfriend Jerry and his father, a formidable old man who knew all the\r\nshady secrets of all the noble families in England.\r\n\r\nBill walked up the stairs and was shown into the room where Jerry,\r\nwhen his father's eye was upon him, gave his daily imitation of a\r\nyoung man labouring with diligence and enthusiasm at the law. His\r\nfather being at the moment out at lunch, the junior partner was\r\npractising putts with an umbrella and a ball of paper.\r\n\r\nJerry Nichols was not the typical lawyer. At Cambridge, where Bill\r\nhad first made his acquaintance, he had been notable for an\r\nexuberance of which Lincoln's Inn Fields had not yet cured him.\r\nThere was an airy disregard for legal formalities about him which\r\nexasperated his father, an attorney of the old school. He came to\r\nthe point, directly Bill entered the room, with a speed and levity\r\nthat would have appalled Nichols Senior, and must have caused the\r\nother two Nicholses to revolve in their graves.\r\n\r\n'Halloa, Bill, old man,' he said, prodding him amiably in the\r\nwaistcoat with the ferrule of the umbrella. 'How's the boy? Fine!\r\nSo'm I. So you got my message? Wonderful invention, the\r\ntelephone.'\r\n\r\n'I've just come from the club.'\r\n\r\n'Take a chair.'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?'\r\n\r\nJerry Nichols thrust Bill into a chair and seated himself on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n'Now look here, Bill,' he said, 'this isn't the way we usually do\r\nthis sort of thing, and if the governor were here he would spend\r\nan hour and a half rambling on about testators and beneficiary\r\nlegatees, and parties of the first part, and all that sort of rot.\r\nBut as he isn't here I want to know, as one pal to another, what\r\nyou've been doing to an old buster of the name of Nutcombe.'\r\n\r\n'Nutcombe?'\r\n\r\n'Nutcombe.'\r\n\r\n'Not Ira Nutcombe?'\r\n\r\n'Ira J. Nutcombe, formerly of Chicago, later of London, now a\r\ndisembodied spirit.'\r\n\r\n'Is he dead?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. And he's left you something like a million pounds.'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n'Joking apart, Jerry, old man,' he said, 'what did you ask me to\r\ncome here for? The committee expects me to spend some of my time\r\nat the club, and if I hang about here all the afternoon I shall\r\nlose my job. Besides, I've got to get back to ask them for--'\r\n\r\nJerry Nichols clutched his forehead with both hands, raised both\r\nhands to heaven, and then, as if despairing of calming himself by\r\nthese means, picked up a paper-weight from the desk and hurled it\r\nat a portrait of the founder of the firm, which hung over the\r\nmantelpiece. He got down from the table and crossed the room to\r\ninspect the ruins.\r\n\r\nThen, having taken a pair of scissors and cut the cord, he allowed\r\nthe portrait to fall to the floor.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell. The prematurely-aged office-boy, who was\r\nundoubtedly destined to become a member of the firm some day,\r\nanswered the ring.\r\n\r\n'Perkins.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Inspect yonder _souffle_.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You have observed it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You are wondering how it got there?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I will tell you. You and I were in here, discussing certain legal\r\nminutiae in the interests of the firm, when it suddenly fell. We\r\nboth saw it and were very much surprised and startled. I soothed\r\nyour nervous system by giving you this half-crown. The whole\r\nincident was very painful. Can you remember all this to tell my\r\nfather when he comes in? I shall be out lunching then.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'An admirable lad that,' said Jerry Nichols as the door closed.\r\n'He has been here two years, and I have never heard him say\r\nanything except \"Yes, sir.\" He will go far. Well, now that I am\r\ncalmer let us return to your little matter. Honestly, Bill, you\r\nmake me sick. When I contemplate you the iron enters my soul. You\r\nstand there talking about your tuppenny-ha'penny job as if it\r\nmattered a cent whether you kept it or not. Can't you understand\r\nplain English? Can't you realize that you can buy Brown's and turn\r\nit into a moving-picture house if you like? You're a millionaire!'\r\n\r\nBill's face expressed no emotion whatsoever. Outwardly he appeared\r\nunmoved. Inwardly he was a riot of bewilderment, incapable of\r\nspeech. He stared at Jerry dumbly.\r\n\r\n'We've got the will in the old oak chest,' went on Jerry Nichols.\r\n'I won't show it to you, partly because the governor has got the\r\nkey and he would have a fit if he knew that I was giving you early\r\ninformation like this, and partly because you wouldn't understand\r\nit. It is full of \"whereases\" and \"peradventures\" and \"heretofores\"\r\nand similar swank, and there aren't any stops in it. It takes the legal\r\nmind, like mine, to tackle wills. What it says, when you've peeled\r\noff a few of the long words which they put in to make it more\r\ninteresting, is that old Nutcombe leaves you the money because\r\nyou are the only man who ever did him a disinterested kindness--and\r\nwhat I want to get out of you is, what was the disinterested kindness?\r\nBecause I'm going straight out to do it to every elderly, rich-looking\r\nman I can find till I pick a winner.'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish found speech.\r\n\r\n'Jerry, is this really true?'\r\n\r\n'Gospel.'\r\n\r\n'You aren't pulling my leg?'\r\n\r\n'Pulling your leg? Of course I'm not pulling your leg. What do you\r\ntake me for? I'm a dry, hard-headed lawyer. The firm of Nichols,\r\nNichols, Nichols, and Nichols doesn't go about pulling people's\r\nlegs!'\r\n\r\n'Good Lord!'\r\n\r\n'It appears from the will that you worked this disinterested gag,\r\nwhatever it was, at Marvis Bay no longer ago than last year.\r\nWherein you showed a lot of sense, for Ira J., having altered his\r\nwill in your favour, apparently had no time before he died to\r\nalter it again in somebody else's, which he would most certainly\r\nhave done if he had lived long enough, for his chief recreation\r\nseems to have been making his will. To my certain knowledge he has\r\nmade three in the last two years. I've seen them. He was one of\r\nthose confirmed will-makers. He got the habit at an early age, and\r\nwas never able to shake it off. Do you remember anything about the\r\nman?'\r\n\r\n'It isn't possible!'\r\n\r\n'Anything's possible with a man cracked enough to make freak wills\r\nand not cracked enough to have them disputed on the ground of\r\ninsanity. What did you do to him at Marvis Bay? Save him from\r\ndrowning?'\r\n\r\n'I cured him of slicing.'\r\n\r\n'You did what?'\r\n\r\n'He used to slice his approach shots. I cured him.'\r\n\r\n'The thing begins to hang together. A certain plausibility creeps\r\ninto it. The late Nutcombe was crazy about golf. The governor used\r\nto play with him now and then at Walton Heath. It was the only\r\nthing Nutcombe seemed to live for. That being so, if you got rid\r\nof his slice for him it seems to me, that you earned your money.\r\nThe only point that occurs to me is, how does it affect your\r\namateur status? It looks to me as if you were now a pro.'\r\n\r\n'But, Jerry, it's absurd. All I did was to give him a tip or two.\r\nWe were the only men down there, as it was out of the season, and\r\nthat drew us together. And when I spotted this slice of his I just\r\ngave him a bit of advice. I give you my word that was all. He\r\ncan't have left me a fortune on the strength of that!'\r\n\r\n'You don't tell the story right, Bill. I can guess what really\r\nhappened--to wit, that you gave up all your time to helping the\r\nold fellow improve his game, regardless of the fact that it\r\ncompletely ruined your holiday.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no!'\r\n\r\n'It's no use sitting there saying \"Oh, no!\" I can see you at it.\r\nThe fact is, you're such an infernally good chap that something of\r\nthis sort was bound to happen to you sooner or later. I think\r\nmaking you his heir was the only sensible thing old Nutcombe ever\r\ndid. In his place I'd have done the same.'\r\n\r\n'But he didn't even seem decently grateful at the time.'\r\n\r\n'Probably not. He was a queer old bird. He had a most almighty row\r\nwith the governor in this office only a month or two ago about\r\nabsolutely nothing. They disagreed about something trivial, and\r\nold Nutcombe stalked out and never came in again. That's the sort\r\nof old bird he was.'\r\n\r\n'Was he sane, do you think?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely, for legal purposes. We have three opinions from leading\r\ndoctors--collected by him in case of accidents, I suppose--each of\r\nwhich declares him perfectly sound from the collar upward. But a\r\nman can be pretty far gone, you know, without being legally insane,\r\nand old Nutcombe--well, suppose we call him whimsical. He seems to\r\nhave zigzagged between the normal and the eccentric.\r\n\r\n'His only surviving relatives appear to be a nephew and a niece.\r\nThe nephew dropped out of the running two years ago when his aunt,\r\nold Nutcombe's wife, who had divorced old Nutcombe, left him her\r\nmoney. This seems to have soured the old boy on the nephew, for in\r\nthe first of his wills that I've seen--you remember I told you I\r\nhad seen three--he leaves the niece the pile and the nephew only\r\ngets twenty pounds. Well, so far there's nothing very eccentric\r\nabout old Nutcombe's proceedings. But wait!\r\n\r\n'Six months after he had made that will he came in here and made\r\nanother. This left twenty pounds to the nephew as before, but\r\nnothing at all to the niece. Why, I don't know. There was nothing\r\nin the will about her having done anything to offend him during\r\nthose six months, none of those nasty slams you see in wills about\r\n\"I bequeath to my only son John one shilling and sixpence. Now\r\nperhaps he's sorry he married the cook.\" As far as I can make out\r\nhe changed his will just as he did when he left the money to you,\r\npurely through some passing whim. Anyway, he did change it. He\r\nleft the pile to support the movement those people are running for\r\ngetting the Jews back to Palestine.\r\n\r\n'He didn't seem, on second thoughts, to feel that this was quite\r\nsuch a brainy scheme as he had at first, and it wasn't long before\r\nhe came trotting back to tear up this second will and switch back\r\nto the first one--the one leaving the money to the niece. That\r\nrestoration to sanity lasted till about a month ago, when he broke\r\nloose once more and paid his final visit here to will you the\r\ncontents of his stocking. This morning I see he's dead after a\r\nshort illness, so you collect. Congratulations!'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish had listened to this speech in perfect silence. He now\r\nrose and began to pace the room. He looked warm and uncomfortable.\r\nHis demeanour, in fact, was by no means the accepted demeanour of\r\nthe lucky heir.\r\n\r\n'This is awful!' he said. 'Good Lord, Jerry, it's frightful!'\r\n\r\n'Awful!--being left a million pounds?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, like this. I feel like a bally thief.'\r\n\r\n'Why on earth?'\r\n\r\n'If it hadn't been for me this girl--what's her name?'\r\n\r\n'Her name is Boyd--Elizabeth Boyd.'\r\n\r\n'She would have had the whole million if it hadn't been for me.\r\nHave you told her yet?'\r\n\r\n'She's in America. I was writing her a letter just before you came\r\nin--informal, you know, to put her out of her misery. If I had\r\nwaited for the governor to let her know in the usual course of red\r\ntape we should never have got anywhere. Also one to the nephew,\r\ntelling him about his twenty pounds. I believe in humane treatment\r\non these occasions. The governor would write them a legal letter\r\nwith so many \"hereinbefores\" in it that they would get the idea\r\nthat they had been left the whole pile. I just send a cheery line\r\nsaying \"It's no good, old top. Abandon hope,\" and they know just\r\nwhere they are. Simple and considerate.'\r\n\r\nA glance at Bill's face moved him to further speech.\r\n\r\n'I don't see why you should worry, Bill. How, by any stretch of\r\nthe imagination, can you make out that you are to blame for this\r\nBoyd girl's misfortune? It looks to me as if these eccentric wills\r\nof old Nutcombe's came in cycles, as it were. Just as he was due\r\nfor another outbreak he happened to meet you. It's a moral\r\ncertainty that if he hadn't met you he would have left all his\r\nmoney to a Home for Superannuated Caddies or a Fund for Supplying\r\nthe Deserving Poor with Niblicks. Why should you blame yourself?'\r\n\r\n'I don't blame myself. It isn't exactly that. But--but, well, what\r\nwould you feel like in my place?'\r\n\r\n'A two-year-old.'\r\n\r\n'Wouldn't you do anything?'\r\n\r\n'I certainly would. By my halidom, I would! I would spend that\r\nmoney with a vim and speed that would make your respected\r\nancestor, the Beau, look like a village miser.'\r\n\r\n'You wouldn't--er--pop over to America and see whether something\r\ncouldn't be arranged?'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'I mean--suppose you were popping in any case. Suppose you had\r\nhappened to buy a ticket for New York on to-morrow's boat,\r\nwouldn't you try to get in touch with this girl when you got to\r\nAmerica, and see if you couldn't--er--fix up something?'\r\n\r\nJerry Nichols looked at him in honest consternation. He had always\r\nknown that old Bill was a dear old ass, but he had never dreamed\r\nthat he was such an infernal old ass as this.\r\n\r\n'You aren't thinking of doing that?' he gasped.\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, it's a funny coincidence, but I was going to\r\nAmerica, anyhow, to-morrow. I don't see why I shouldn't try to fix\r\nup something with this girl.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean--fix up something? You don't suggest that you\r\nshould give the money up, do you?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. Not exactly that, perhaps. How would it be if I\r\ngave her half, what? Anyway, I should like to find out about her,\r\nsee if she's hard up, and so on. I should like to nose round, you\r\nknow, and--er--and so forth, don't you know. Where did you say the\r\ngirl lived?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't say, and I'm not sure that I shall. Honestly, Bill, you\r\nmustn't be so quixotic.'\r\n\r\n'There's no harm in my nosing round, is there? Be a good chap and\r\ngive me the address.'\r\n\r\n'Well'--with misgivings--'Brookport, Long Island.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks.'\r\n\r\n'Bill, are you really going to make a fool of yourself?'\r\n\r\n'Not a bit of it, old chap. I'm just going to--er--'\r\n\r\n'To nose round?'\r\n\r\n'To nose round,' said Bill.\r\n\r\nJerry Nichols accompanied his friend to the door, and once more\r\npeace reigned in the offices of Nichols, Nichols, Nichols, and\r\nNichols.\r\n\r\nThe time of a man who has at a moment's notice decided to leave\r\nhis native land for a sojourn on foreign soil is necessarily taken\r\nup with a variety of occupations; and it was not till the\r\nfollowing afternoon, on the boat at Liverpool, that Bill had\r\nleisure to write to Claire, giving her the news of what had\r\nbefallen him. He had booked his ticket by a Liverpool boat in\r\npreference to one that sailed from Southampton because he had not\r\nbeen sure how Claire would take the news of his sudden decision to\r\nleave for America. There was the chance that she might ridicule or\r\ncondemn the scheme, and he preferred to get away without seeing\r\nher. Now that he had received this astounding piece of news from\r\nJerry Nichols he was relieved that he had acted in this way.\r\nWhatever Claire might have thought of the original scheme, there\r\nwas no doubt at all what she would think of his plan of seeking\r\nout Elizabeth Boyd with a view to dividing the legacy with her.\r\n\r\nHe was guarded in his letter. He mentioned no definite figures. He\r\nwrote that Ira Nutcombe of whom they had spoken so often had most\r\nsurprisingly left him in his will a large sum of money, and eased\r\nhis conscience by telling himself that half of a million pounds\r\nundeniably was a large sum of money.\r\n\r\nThe addressing of the letter called for thought. She would have\r\nleft Southampton with the rest of the company before it could\r\narrive. Where was it that she said they were going next week?\r\nPortsmouth, that was it. He addressed the letter Care of The Girl\r\nand the Artist Company, to the King's Theatre, Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village of Brookport, Long Island, is a summer place. It\r\nlives, like the mosquitoes that infest it, entirely on its summer\r\nvisitors. At the time of the death of Mr Ira Nutcombe, the only\r\nall-the-year-round inhabitants were the butcher, the grocer, the\r\nchemist, the other customary fauna of villages, and Miss Elizabeth\r\nBoyd, who rented the ramshackle farm known locally as Flack's and\r\neked out a precarious livelihood by keeping bees.\r\n\r\nIf you take down your _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, Volume III,\r\nAUS to BIS, you will find that bees are a 'large and natural\r\nfamily of the zoological order Hymenoptera, characterized by the\r\nplumose form of many of their hairs, by the large size of the\r\nbasal segment of the foot ... and by the development of a \"tongue\"\r\nfor sucking liquid food,' the last of which peculiarities, it is\r\ninteresting to note, they shared with Claude Nutcombe Boyd,\r\nElizabeth's brother, who for quite a long time--till his money ran\r\nout--had made liquid food almost his sole means of sustenance.\r\nThese things, however, are by the way. We are not such snobs as to\r\nthink better or worse of a bee because it can claim kinship with\r\nthe _Hymenoptera_ family, nor so ill-bred as to chaff it for\r\nhaving large feet. The really interesting passage in the article\r\noccurs later, where it says: 'The bee industry prospers greatly in\r\nAmerica.'\r\n\r\nThis is one of those broad statements that invite challenge.\r\nElizabeth Boyd would have challenged it. She had not prospered\r\ngreatly. With considerable trouble she contrived to pay her way,\r\nand that was all.\r\n\r\nAgain referring to the 'Encyclopaedia,' we find the words: 'Before\r\nundertaking the management of a modern apiary, the beekeeper\r\nshould possess a certain amount of aptitude for the pursuit.' This\r\nwas possibly the trouble with Elizabeth's venture, considered from\r\na commercial point of view. She loved bees, but she was not an\r\nexpert on them. She had started her apiary with a small capital, a\r\nbook of practical hints, and a second-hand queen, principally\r\nbecause she was in need of some occupation that would enable her\r\nto live in the country. It was the unfortunate condition of Claude\r\nNutcombe which made life in the country a necessity. At that time\r\nhe was spending the remains of the money left him by his aunt, and\r\nElizabeth had hardly settled down at Brookport and got her venture\r\nunder way when she found herself obliged to provide for Nutty a\r\ncombination of home and sanatorium. It had been the poor lad's\r\nmistaken view that he could drink up all the alcoholic liquor in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious law of Nature that the most undeserving brothers\r\nalways have the best sisters. Thrifty, plodding young men, who get\r\nup early, and do it now, and catch the employer's eye, and save\r\nhalf their salaries, have sisters who never speak civilly to them\r\nexcept when they want to borrow money. To the Claude Nutcombes of\r\nthe world are vouchsafed the Elizabeths.\r\n\r\nThe great aim of Elizabeth's life was to make a new man of Nutty.\r\nIt was her hope that the quiet life and soothing air of Brookport,\r\nwith--unless you counted the money-in-the-slot musical box at the\r\nstore--its absence of the fiercer excitements, might in time pull\r\nhim together and unscramble his disordered nervous system. She\r\nliked to listen of a morning to the sound of Nutty busy in the\r\nnext room with a broom and a dustpan, for in the simple lexicon of\r\nFlack's there was no such word as 'help'. The privy purse would\r\nnot run to a maid. Elizabeth did the cooking and Claude Nutcombe\r\nthe housework.\r\n\r\nSeveral days after Claire Fenwick and Lord Dawlish, by different\r\nroutes, had sailed from England, Elizabeth Boyd sat up in bed and\r\nshook her mane of hair from her eyes, yawning. Outside her window\r\nthe birds were singing, and a shaft of sunlight intruded itself\r\nbeneath the blind. But what definitely convinced her that it was\r\ntime to get up was the plaintive note of James, the cat,\r\npatrolling the roof of the porch. An animal of regular habits,\r\nJames always called for breakfast at eight-thirty sharp.\r\n\r\nElizabeth got out of bed, wrapped her small body in a pink kimono,\r\nthrust her small feet into a pair of blue slippers, yawned again,\r\nand went downstairs. Having taken last night's milk from the ice-box,\r\nshe went to the back door, and, having filled James's saucer,\r\nstood on the grass beside it, sniffing the morning air.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Boyd was twenty-one, but standing there with her hair\r\ntumbling about her shoulders she might have been taken by a\r\nnot-too-close observer for a child. It was only when you saw her eyes\r\nand the resolute tilt of the chin that you realized that she was a\r\nyoung woman very well able to take care of herself in a difficult\r\nworld. Her hair was very fair, her eyes brown and very bright, and\r\nthe contrast was extraordinarily piquant. They were valiant eyes,\r\nfull of spirit; eyes, also, that saw the humour of things. And her\r\nmouth was the mouth of one who laughs easily. Her chin, small like\r\nthe rest of her, was strong; and in the way she held herself there\r\nwas a boyish jauntiness. She looked--and was--a capable little\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nShe stood besides James like a sentinel, watching over him as he\r\nbreakfasted. There was a puppy belonging to one of the neighbours\r\nwho sometimes lumbered over and stole James's milk, disposing of\r\nit in greedy gulps while its rightful proprietor looked on with\r\npiteous helplessness. Elizabeth was fond of the puppy, but her\r\nsense of justice was keen and she was there to check this\r\nbrigandage.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect day, cloudless and still. There was peace in the\r\nair. James, having finished his milk, began to wash himself. A\r\nsquirrel climbed cautiously down from a linden tree. From the\r\norchard came the murmur of many bees.\r\n\r\nAesthetically Elizabeth was fond of still, cloudless days, but\r\nexperience had taught her to suspect them. As was the custom in\r\nthat locality, the water supply depended on a rickety windwheel.\r\nIt was with a dark foreboding that she returned to the kitchen and\r\nturned on one of the taps. For perhaps three seconds a stream of\r\nthe dimension of a darning-needle emerged, then with a sad gurgle\r\nthe tap relapsed into a stolid inaction. There is no stolidity so\r\nutter as that of a waterless tap.\r\n\r\n'Confound it!' said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nShe passed through the dining-room to the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n'Nutty!'\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\n'Nutty, my precious lamb!'\r\n\r\nUpstairs in the room next to her own a long, spare form began to\r\nuncurl itself in bed; a face with a receding chin and a small\r\nforehead raised itself reluctantly from the pillow, and Claude\r\nNutcombe Boyd signalized the fact that he was awake by scowling at\r\nthe morning sun and uttering an aggrieved groan.\r\n\r\nAlas, poor Nutty! This was he whom but yesterday Broadway had\r\nknown as the Speed Kid, on whom head-waiters had smiled and lesser\r\nwaiters fawned; whose snake-like form had nestled in so many a\r\nfront-row orchestra stall.\r\n\r\nWhere were his lobster Newburgs now, his cold quarts that were\r\nwont to set the table in a roar?\r\n\r\nNutty Boyd conformed as nearly as a human being may to Euclid's\r\ndefinition of a straight line. He was length without breadth. From\r\nboyhood's early day he had sprouted like a weed, till now in the\r\nmiddle twenties he gave startled strangers the conviction that it\r\nonly required a sharp gust of wind to snap him in half. Lying in\r\nbed, he looked more like a length of hose-pipe than anything else.\r\nWhile he was unwinding himself the door opened and Elizabeth came\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n'Good morning, Nutty!'\r\n\r\n'What's the time?' asked her brother, hollowly.\r\n\r\n'Getting on towards nine. It's a lovely day. The birds are\r\nsinging, the bees are buzzing, summer's in the air. It's one of\r\nthose beautiful, shiny, heavenly, gorgeous days.'\r\n\r\nA look of suspicion came into Nutty's eyes. Elizabeth was not\r\noften as lyrical as this.\r\n\r\n'There's a catch somewhere,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Well, as a matter of fact,' said Elizabeth, carelessly, 'the\r\nwater's off again.'\r\n\r\n'Confound it!'\r\n\r\n'I said that. I'm afraid we aren't a very original family.'\r\n\r\n'What a ghastly place this is! Why can't you see old Flack and\r\nmake him mend that infernal wheel?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to pounce on him and have another try directly I see\r\nhim. Meanwhile, darling Nutty, will you get some clothes on and go\r\nround to the Smiths and ask them to lend us a pailful?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, gosh, it's over a mile!'\r\n\r\n'No, no, not more than three-quarters.'\r\n\r\n'Lugging a pail that weighs a ton! The last time I went there\r\ntheir dog bit me.'\r\n\r\n'I expect that was because you slunk in all doubled up, and he got\r\nsuspicious. You should hold your head up and throw your chest out\r\nand stride up as if you were a military friend of the family.'\r\n\r\nSelf-pity lent Nutty eloquence.\r\n\r\n'For Heaven's sake! You drag me out of bed at some awful hour of\r\nthe morning when a rational person would just be turning in; you\r\nsend me across country to fetch pailfuls of water when I'm feeling\r\nlike a corpse; and on top of that you expect me to behave like a\r\ndrum-major!'\r\n\r\n'Dearest, you can wriggle on your tummy, if you like, so long as\r\nyou get the fluid. We must have water. I can't fetch it. I'm a\r\ndelicately-nurtured female.'\r\n\r\n'We ought to have a man to do these ghastly jobs.'\r\n\r\n'But we can't afford one. Just at present all I ask is to be able\r\nto pay expenses. And, as a matter of fact, you ought to be very\r\nthankful that you have got--'\r\n\r\n'A roof over my head? I know. You needn't keep rubbing it in.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth flushed.\r\n\r\n'I wasn't going to say that at all. What a pig you are sometimes,\r\nNutty. As if I wasn't only too glad to have you here. What I was\r\ngoing to say was that you ought to be very thankful that you have\r\ngot to draw water and hew wood--'\r\n\r\nA look of absolute alarm came into Nutty's pallid face.\r\n\r\n'You don't mean to say that you want some wood chopped?'\r\n\r\n'I was speaking figuratively. I meant hustle about and work in the\r\nopen air. The sort of life you are leading now is what millionaires\r\npay hundreds of dollars for at these physical-culture places. It\r\nhas been the making of you.'\r\n\r\n'I don't feel made.'\r\n\r\n'Your nerves are ever so much better.'\r\n\r\n'They aren't.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth looked at him in alarm.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Nutty, you haven't been--seeing anything again, have you?'\r\n\r\n'Not seeing, dreaming. I've been dreaming about monkeys. Why\r\nshould I dream about monkeys if my nerves were all right?'\r\n\r\n'I often dream about all sorts of queer things.'\r\n\r\n'Have you ever dreamed that you were being chased up Broadway by a\r\nchimpanzee in evening dress?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind, dear, you'll be quite all right again when you have\r\nbeen living this life down here a little longer.'\r\n\r\nNutty glared balefully at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n'What's that darned thing up there on the ceiling? It looks like a\r\nhornet. How on earth do these things get into the house?'\r\n\r\n'We ought to have nettings. I am going to pounce on Mr Flack about\r\nthat too.'\r\n\r\n'Thank goodness this isn't going to last much longer. It's nearly\r\ntwo weeks since Uncle Ira died. We ought to be hearing from the\r\nlawyers any day now. There might be a letter this morning.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think he has left us his money?'\r\n\r\n'Do I? Why, what else could he do with it? We are his only\r\nsurviving relatives, aren't we? I've had to go through life with a\r\nghastly name like Nutcombe as a compliment to him, haven't I? I\r\nwrote to him regularly at Christmas and on his birthday, didn't I?\r\nWell, then! I have a feeling there will be a letter from the\r\nlawyers to-day. I wish you would get dressed and go down to the\r\npost-office while I'm fetching that infernal water. I can't think\r\nwhy the fools haven't cabled. You would have supposed they would\r\nhave thought of that.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth returned to her room to dress. She was conscious of a\r\nfeeling that nothing was quite perfect in this world. It would be\r\nnice to have a great deal of money, for she had a scheme in her\r\nmind which called for a large capital; but she was sorry that it\r\ncould come to her only through the death of her uncle, of whom,\r\ndespite his somewhat forbidding personality, she had always been\r\nfond. She was also sorry that a large sum of money was coming to\r\nNutty at that particular point in his career, just when there\r\nseemed the hope that the simple life might pull him together. She\r\nknew Nutty too well not to be able to forecast his probable\r\nbehaviour under the influence of a sudden restoration of wealth.\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts were passing through her mind she happened to\r\nglance out of the window. Nutty was shambling through the garden\r\nwith his pail, a bowed, shuffling pillar of gloom. As Elizabeth\r\nwatched, he dropped the pail and lashed the air violently for a\r\nwhile. From her knowledge of bees ('It is needful to remember that\r\nbees resent outside interference and will resolutely defend\r\nthemselves,' _Encyc. Brit._, Vol. III, AUS to BIS) Elizabeth\r\ndeduced that one of her little pets was annoying him. This episode\r\nconcluded, Nutty resumed his pail and the journey, and at this\r\nmoment there appeared over the hedge the face of Mr John Prescott,\r\na neighbour. Mr Prescott, who had dismounted from a bicycle,\r\ncalled to Nutty and waved something in the air. To a stranger the\r\nperformance would have been obscure, but Elizabeth understood it.\r\nMr Prescott was intimating that he had been down to the post-office\r\nfor his own letters and, as was his neighbourly custom on these\r\noccasions, had brought back also letters for Flack's.\r\n\r\nNutty foregathered with Mr Prescott and took the letters from him.\r\nMr Prescott disappeared. Nutty selected one of the letters and\r\nopened it. Then, having stood perfectly still for some moments, he\r\nsuddenly turned and began to run towards the house.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that her brother, whose usual mode of progression\r\nwas a languid saunter, should be actually running, was enough to\r\ntell Elizabeth that the letter which Nutty had read was from the\r\nLondon lawyers. No other communication could have galvanized him\r\ninto such energy. Whether the contents of the letter were good or\r\nbad it was impossible at that distance to say. But when she\r\nreached the open air, just as Nutty charged up, she saw by his\r\nface that it was anguish not joy that had spurred him on. He was\r\ngasping and he bubbled unintelligible words. His little eyes\r\ngleamed wildly.\r\n\r\n'Nutty, darling, what is it?' cried Elizabeth, every maternal\r\ninstinct in her aroused.\r\n\r\nHe was thrusting a sheet of paper at her, a sheet of paper that\r\nbore the superscription of Nichols, Nichols, Nichols, and Nichols,\r\nwith a London address.\r\n\r\n'Uncle Ira--' Nutty choked. 'Twenty pounds! He's left me twenty\r\npounds, and all the rest to a--to a man named Dawlish!'\r\n\r\nIn silence Elizabeth took the letter. It was even as he had said.\r\nA few moments before Elizabeth had been regretting the imminent\r\ndescent of wealth upon her brother. Now she was inconsistent\r\nenough to boil with rage at the shattering blow which had befallen\r\nhim. That she, too, had lost her inheritance hardly occurred to\r\nher. Her thoughts were all for Nutty. It did not need the sight of\r\nhim, gasping and gurgling before her, to tell her how overwhelming\r\nwas his disappointment.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to be angry with the deceased Mr Nutcombe. He was\r\ntoo shadowy a mark. Besides, he was dead. The whole current of her\r\nwrath turned upon the supplanter, this Lord Dawlish. She pictured\r\nhim as a crafty adventurer, a wretched fortune-hunter. For some\r\nreason or other she imagined him a sinister person with a black\r\nmoustache, a face thin and hawk-like, and unpleasant eyes. That\r\nwas the sort of man who would be likely to fasten his talons into\r\npoor Uncle Ira.\r\n\r\nShe had never hated any one in her life before, but as she stood\r\nthere at that moment she felt that she loathed and detested\r\nWilliam Lord Dawlish--unhappy, well-meaning Bill, who only a few\r\nhours back had set foot on American soil in his desire to nose\r\nround and see if something couldn't be arranged.\r\n\r\nNutty fetched the water. Life is like that. There is nothing\r\nclean-cut about it, no sense of form. Instead of being permitted\r\nto concentrate his attention on his tragedy Nutty had to trudge\r\nthree-quarters of a mile, conciliate a bull-terrier, and trudge\r\nback again carrying a heavy pail. It was as if one of the heroes\r\nof Greek drama, in the middle of his big scene, had been asked to\r\nrun round the corner to a provision store.\r\n\r\nThe exercise did not act as a restorative. The blow had been too\r\nsudden, too overwhelming. Nutty's reason--such as it was--tottered\r\non its throne. Who was Lord Dawlish? What had he done to\r\ningratiate himself with Uncle Ira? By what insidious means, with\r\nwhat devilish cunning, had he wormed his way into the old man's\r\nfavour? These were the questions that vexed Nutty's mind when he\r\nwas able to think at all coherently.\r\n\r\nBack at the farm Elizabeth cooked breakfast and awaited her\r\nbrother's return with a sinking heart. She was a soft-hearted\r\ngirl, easily distressed by the sight of suffering; and she was\r\naware that Nutty was scarcely of the type that masks its woes\r\nbehind a brave and cheerful smile. Her heart bled for Nutty.\r\n\r\nThere was a weary step outside. Nutty entered, slopping water. One\r\nglance at his face was enough to tell Elizabeth that she had\r\nformed a too conservative estimate of his probable gloom. Without\r\na word he coiled his long form in a chair. There was silence in\r\nthe stricken house.\r\n\r\n'What's the time?'\r\n\r\nElizabeth glanced at her watch.\r\n\r\n'Half-past nine.'\r\n\r\n'About now,' said Nutty, sepulchrally, 'the blighter is ringing\r\nfor his man to prepare his bally bath and lay out his gold-leaf\r\nunderwear. After that he will drive down to the bank and draw some\r\nof our money.'\r\n\r\nThe day passed wearily for Elizabeth. Nutty having the air of one\r\nwho is still engaged in picking up the pieces, she had not the\r\nheart to ask him to play his customary part in the household\r\nduties, so she washed the dishes and made the beds herself. After\r\nthat she attended to the bees. After that she cooked lunch.\r\n\r\nNutty was not chatty at lunch. Having observed 'About now the\r\nblighter is cursing the waiter for bringing the wrong brand of\r\nchampagne,' he relapsed into a silence which he did not again\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was busy again in the afternoon. At four o'clock,\r\nfeeling tired out, she went to her room to lie down until the next\r\nof her cycle of domestic duties should come round.\r\n\r\nIt was late when she came downstairs, for she had fallen asleep.\r\nThe sun had gone down. Bees were winging their way heavily back to\r\nthe hives with their honey. She went out into the grounds to try\r\nto find Nutty. There had been no signs of him in the house. There\r\nwere no signs of him about the grounds. It was not like him to\r\nhave taken a walk, but it seemed the only possibility. She went\r\nback to the house to wait. Eight o'clock came, and nine, and it\r\nwas then the truth dawned upon her--Nutty had escaped. He had\r\nslipped away and gone up to New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish sat in the New York flat which had been lent him by\r\nhis friend Gates. The hour was half-past ten in the evening; the\r\nday, the second day after the exodus of Nutty Boyd from the farm.\r\nBefore him on the table lay a letter. He was smoking pensively.\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish had found New York enjoyable, but a trifle fatiguing.\r\nThere was much to be seen in the city, and he had made the mistake\r\nof trying to see it all at once. It had been his intention, when\r\nhe came home after dinner that night, to try to restore the\r\nbalance of things by going to bed early. He had sat up longer than\r\nhe had intended, because he had been thinking about this letter.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon his arrival in America, Bill had sought out a\r\nlawyer and instructed him to write to Elizabeth Boyd, offering her\r\none-half of the late Ira Nutcombe's money. He had had time during\r\nthe voyage to think the whole matter over, and this seemed to him\r\nthe only possible course. He could not keep it all. He would feel\r\nlike the despoiler of the widow and the orphan. Nor would it be\r\nfair to Claire to give it all up. If he halved the legacy\r\neverybody would be satisfied.\r\n\r\nThat at least had been his view until Elizabeth's reply had\r\narrived. It was this reply that lay on the table--a brief, formal\r\nnote, setting forth Miss Boyd's absolute refusal to accept any\r\nportion of the money. This was a development which Bill had not\r\nforeseen, and he was feeling baffled. What was the next step? He\r\nhad smoked many pipes in the endeavour to find an answer to this\r\nproblem, and was lighting another when the door-bell rang.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and found himself confronting an extraordinarily\r\ntall and thin young man in evening-dress.\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish was a little startled. He had taken it for granted,\r\nwhen the bell rang, that his visitor was Tom, the liftman from\r\ndownstairs, a friendly soul who hailed from London and had been\r\ndropping in at intervals during the past two days to acquire the\r\nlatest news from his native land. He stared at this changeling\r\ninquiringly. The solution of the mystery came with the stranger's\r\nfirst words--\r\n\r\n'Is Gates in?'\r\n\r\nHe spoke eagerly, as if Gates were extremely necessary to his\r\nwell-being. It distressed Lord Dawlish to disappoint him, but\r\nthere was nothing else to be done.\r\n\r\n'Gates is in London,' he said.\r\n\r\n'What! When did he go there?'\r\n\r\n'About four months ago.'\r\n\r\n'May I come in a minute?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, rather, do.'\r\n\r\nHe led the way into the sitting-room. The stranger gave abruptly\r\nin the middle, as if he were being folded up by some invisible\r\nagency, and in this attitude sank into a chair, where he lay back\r\nlooking at Bill over his knees, like a sorrowful sheep peering\r\nover a sharp-pointed fence.\r\n\r\n'You're from England, aren't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Been in New York long?'\r\n\r\n'Only a couple of days.'\r\n\r\nThe stranger folded himself up another foot or so until his knees\r\nwere higher than his head, and lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n'The curse of New York,' he said, mournfully, 'is the way\r\neverything changes in it. You can't take your eyes off it for a\r\nminute. The population's always shifting. It's like a railway\r\nstation. You go away for a bit and come back and try to find your\r\nold pals, and they're all gone: Ike's in Arizona, Mike's in a\r\nsanatorium, Spike's in jail, and nobody seems to know where the\r\nrest of them have got to. I came up from the country two days ago,\r\nexpecting to find the old gang along Broadway the same as ever,\r\nand I'm dashed if I've been able to put my hands on one of them!\r\nNot a single, solitary one of them! And it's only six months since\r\nI was here last.'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish made sympathetic noises.\r\n\r\n'Of course,' proceeded the other, 'the time of year may have\r\nsomething to do with it. Living down in the country you lose count\r\nof time, and I forgot that it was July, when people go out of the\r\ncity. I guess that must be what happened. I used to know all sorts\r\nof fellows, actors and fellows like that, and they're all away\r\nsomewhere. I tell you,' he said, with pathos, 'I never knew I\r\ncould be so infernally lonesome as I have been these last two\r\ndays. If I had known what a rotten time I was going to have I\r\nwould never have left Brookport.'\r\n\r\n'Brookport!'\r\n\r\n'It's a place down on Long Island.'\r\n\r\nBill was not by nature a plotter, but the mere fact of travelling\r\nunder an assumed name had developed a streak of wariness in him.\r\nHe checked himself just as he was about to ask his companion if he\r\nhappened to know a Miss Elizabeth Boyd, who also lived at\r\nBrookport. It occurred to him that the question would invite a\r\ncounter-question as to his own knowledge of Miss Boyd, and he knew\r\nthat he would not be able to invent a satisfactory answer to that\r\noffhand.\r\n\r\n'This evening,' said the thin young man, resuming his dirge, 'I\r\nwas sweating my brain to try to think of somebody I could hunt up\r\nin this ghastly, deserted city. It isn't so easy, you know, to\r\nthink of fellows' names and addresses. I can get the names all\r\nright, but unless the fellow's in the telephone-book, I'm done.\r\nWell, I was trying to think of some of my pals who might still be\r\naround the place, and I remembered Gates. Remembered his address,\r\ntoo, by a miracle. You're a pal of his, of course?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I knew him in London.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I see. And when you came over here he lent you his flat? By\r\nthe way, I didn't get your name?'\r\n\r\n'My name's Chalmers.'\r\n\r\n'Well, as I say, I remembered Gates and came down here to look him\r\nup. We used to have a lot of good times together a year ago. And\r\nnow he's gone too!'\r\n\r\n'Did you want to see him about anything important?'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's important to me. I wanted him to come out to supper.\r\nYou see, it's this way: I'm giving supper to-night to a girl who's\r\nin that show at the Forty-ninth Street Theatre, a Miss Leonard,\r\nand she insists on bringing a pal. She says the pal is a good\r\nsport, which sounds all right--' Bill admitted that it sounded all\r\nright. 'But it makes the party three. And of all the infernal\r\nthings a party of three is the ghastliest.'\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of this undeniable truth the stranger\r\nslid a little farther into his chair and paused. 'Look here, what\r\nare you doing to-night?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I was thinking of going to bed.'\r\n\r\n'Going to bed!' The stranger's voice was shocked, as if he had\r\nheard blasphemy. 'Going to bed at half-past ten in New York! My\r\ndear chap, what you want is a bit of supper. Why don't you come\r\nalong?'\r\n\r\nAmiability was, perhaps, the leading quality of Lord Dawlish's\r\ncharacter. He did not want to have to dress and go out to supper,\r\nbut there was something almost pleading in the eyes that looked at\r\nhim between the sharply-pointed knees.\r\n\r\n'It's awfully good of you--' He hesitated.\r\n\r\n'Not a bit; I wish you would. You would be a life-saver.'\r\n\r\nBill felt that he was in for it. He got up.\r\n\r\n'You will?' said the other. 'Good boy! You go and get into some\r\nclothes and come along. I'm sorry, what did you say your name\r\nwas?'\r\n\r\n'Chalmers.'\r\n\r\n'Mine's Boyd--Nutcombe Boyd.'\r\n\r\n'Boyd!' cried Bill.\r\n\r\nNutty took his astonishment, which was too great to be concealed,\r\nas a compliment. He chuckled.\r\n\r\n'I thought you would know the name if you were a pal of Gates's. I\r\nexpect he's always talking about me. You see, I was pretty well\r\nknown in this old place before I had to leave it.'\r\n\r\nBill walked down the long passage to his bedroom with no trace of\r\nthe sleepiness which had been weighing on him five minutes before.\r\nHe was galvanized by a superstitious thrill. It was fate,\r\nElizabeth Boyd's brother turning up like this and making friendly\r\novertures right on top of that letter from her. This astonishing\r\nthing could not have been better arranged if he had planned it\r\nhimself. From what little he had seen of Nutty he gathered that\r\nthe latter was not hard to make friends with. It would be a simple\r\ntask to cultivate his acquaintance. And having done so, he could\r\nrenew negotiations with Elizabeth. The desire to rid himself of\r\nhalf the legacy had become a fixed idea with Bill. He had the\r\nimpression that he could not really feel clean again until he had\r\nmade matters square with his conscience in this respect. He felt\r\nthat he was probably a fool to take that view of the thing, but\r\nthat was the way he was built and there was no getting away from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis irruption of Nutty Boyd into his life was an omen. It meant\r\nthat all was not yet over. He was conscious of a mild surprise\r\nthat he had ever intended to go to bed. He felt now as if he never\r\nwanted to go to bed again. He felt exhilarated.\r\n\r\nIn these days one cannot say that a supper-party is actually given\r\nin any one place. Supping in New York has become a peripatetic\r\npastime. The supper-party arranged by Nutty Boyd was scheduled to\r\nstart at Reigelheimer's on Forty-second Street, and it was there\r\nthat the revellers assembled.\r\n\r\nNutty and Bill had been there a few minutes when Miss Daisy\r\nLeonard arrived with her friend. And from that moment Bill was\r\nnever himself again.\r\n\r\nThe Good Sport was, so to speak, an outsize in Good Sports. She\r\nloomed up behind the small and demure Miss Leonard like a liner\r\ntowed by a tug. She was big, blonde, skittish, and exuberant; she\r\nwore a dress like the sunset of a fine summer evening, and she\r\neffervesced with spacious good will to all men. She was one of\r\nthose girls who splash into public places like stones into quiet\r\npools. Her form was large, her eyes were large, her teeth were\r\nlarge, and her voice was large. She overwhelmed Bill. She hit his\r\nastounded consciousness like a shell. She gave him a buzzing in\r\nthe ears. She was not so much a Good Sport as some kind of an\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nHe was still reeling from the spiritual impact with this female\r\ntidal wave when he became aware, as one who, coming out of a\r\nswoon, hears voices faintly, that he was being addressed by Miss\r\nLeonard. To turn from Miss Leonard's friend to Miss Leonard\r\nherself was like hearing the falling of gentle rain after a\r\nthunderstorm. For a moment he revelled in the sense of being\r\nsoothed; then, as he realized what she was saying, he started\r\nviolently. Miss Leonard was looking at him curiously.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon?' said Bill.\r\n\r\n'I'm sure I've met you before, Mr Chalmers.'\r\n\r\n'Er--really?'\r\n\r\n'But I can't think where.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sure,' said the Good Sport, languishingly, like a sentimental\r\nsiege-gun, 'that if I had ever met Mr Chalmers before I shouldn't\r\nhave forgotten him.'\r\n\r\n'You're English, aren't you?' asked Miss Leonard.\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nThe Good Sport said she was crazy about Englishmen.\r\n\r\n'I thought so from your voice.'\r\n\r\nThe Good Sport said that she was crazy about the English accent.\r\n\r\n'It must have been in London that I met you. I was in the revue at\r\nthe Alhambra last year.'\r\n\r\n'By George, I wish I had seen you!' interjected the infatuated\r\nNutty.\r\n\r\nThe Good Sport said that she was crazy about London.\r\n\r\n'I seem to remember,' went on Miss Leonard, 'meeting you out at\r\nsupper. Do you know a man named Delaney in the Coldstream Guards?'\r\n\r\nBill would have liked to deny all knowledge of Delaney, though the\r\nlatter was one of his best friends, but his natural honesty\r\nprevented him.\r\n\r\n'I'm sure I met you at a supper he gave at Oddy's one Friday\r\nnight. We all went on to Covent Garden. Don't you remember?'\r\n\r\n'Talking of supper,' broke in Nutty, earning Bill's hearty\r\ngratitude thereby, 'where's the dashed head-waiter? I want to find\r\nmy table.'\r\n\r\nHe surveyed the restaurant with a melancholy eye.\r\n\r\n'Everything changed!' He spoke sadly, as Ulysses might have done\r\nwhen his boat put in at Ithaca. 'Every darned thing different\r\nsince I was here last. New waiter, head-waiter I never saw before\r\nin my life, different-coloured carpet--'\r\n\r\n'Cheer up, Nutty, old thing!' said Miss Leonard. 'You'll feel\r\nbetter when you've had something to eat. I hope you had the sense\r\nto tip the head-waiter, or there won't be any table. Funny how\r\nthese places go up and down in New York. A year ago the whole\r\nmanagement would turn out and kiss you if you looked like spending\r\na couple of dollars here. Now it costs the earth to get in at\r\nall.'\r\n\r\n'Why's that?' asked Nutty.\r\n\r\n'Lady Pauline Wetherby, of course. Didn't you know this was where\r\nshe danced?'\r\n\r\n'Never heard of her,' said Nutty, in a sort of ecstasy of wistful\r\ngloom. 'That will show you how long I've been away. Who is she?'\r\n\r\nMiss Leonard invoked the name of Mike.\r\n\r\n'Don't you ever get the papers in your village, Nutty?'\r\n\r\n'I never read the papers. I don't suppose I've read a paper for\r\nyears. I can't stand 'em. Who is Lady Pauline Wetherby?'\r\n\r\n'She does Greek dances--at least, I suppose they're Greek. They\r\nall are nowadays, unless they're Russian. She's an English\r\npeeress.'\r\n\r\nMiss Leonard's friend said she was crazy about these picturesque\r\nold English families; and they went in to supper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking back on the evening later and reviewing its leading\r\nfeatures, Lord Dawlish came to the conclusion that he never\r\ncompletely recovered from the first shock of the Good Sport. He\r\nwas conscious all the time of a dream-like feeling, as if he were\r\nwatching himself from somewhere outside himself. From some\r\nconning-tower in this fourth dimension he perceived himself eating\r\nbroiled lobster and drinking champagne and heard himself bearing\r\nan adequate part in the conversation; but his movements were\r\nlargely automatic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime passed. It seemed to Lord Dawlish, watching from without,\r\nthat things were livening up. He seemed to perceive a quickening\r\nof the _tempo_ of the revels, an added abandon. Nutty was\r\ngetting quite bright. He had the air of one who recalls the good\r\nold days, of one who in familiar scenes re-enacts the joys of his\r\nvanished youth. The chastened melancholy induced by many months of\r\nfetching of pails of water, of scrubbing floors with a mop, and of\r\njumping like a firecracker to avoid excited bees had been purged\r\nfrom him by the lights and the music and the wine. He was telling\r\na long anecdote, laughing at it, throwing a crust of bread at an\r\nadjacent waiter, and refilling his glass at the same time. It is\r\nnot easy to do all these things simultaneously, and the fact that\r\nNutty did them with notable success was proof that he was picking\r\nup.\r\n\r\nMiss Daisy Leonard was still demure, but as she had just slipped a\r\npiece of ice down the back of Nutty's neck one may assume that she\r\nwas feeling at her ease and had overcome any diffidence or shyness\r\nwhich might have interfered with her complete enjoyment of the\r\nfestivities. As for the Good Sport, she was larger, blonder, and\r\nmore exuberant than ever and she was addressing someone as 'Bill'.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable phenomenon of the evening, as it\r\nadvanced, was the change it wrought in Lord Dawlish's attitude\r\ntoward this same Good Sport. He was not conscious of the beginning\r\nof the change; he awoke to the realization of it suddenly. At the\r\nbeginning of supper his views on her had been definite and clear.\r\nWhen they had first been introduced to each other he had had a\r\nstunned feeling that this sort of thing ought not to be allowed at\r\nlarge, and his battered brain had instinctively recalled that line\r\nof Tennyson: 'The curse is come upon me.' But now, warmed with\r\nfood and drink and smoking an excellent cigar, he found that a\r\ngentler, more charitable mood had descended upon him.\r\n\r\nHe argued with himself in extenuation of the girl's peculiar\r\nidiosyncrasies. Was it, he asked himself, altogether her fault\r\nthat she was so massive and spoke as if she were addressing an\r\nopen-air meeting in a strong gale? Perhaps it was hereditary.\r\nPerhaps her father had been a circus giant and her mother the\r\nstrong woman of the troupe. And for the unrestraint of her manner\r\ndefective training in early girlhood would account. He began to\r\nregard her with a quiet, kindly commiseration, which in its turn\r\nchanged into a sort of brotherly affection. He discovered that he\r\nliked her. He liked her very much. She was so big and jolly and\r\nrobust, and spoke in such a clear, full voice. He was glad that\r\nshe was patting his hand. He was glad that he had asked her to\r\ncall him Bill.\r\n\r\nPeople were dancing now. It has been claimed by patriots that\r\nAmerican dyspeptics lead the world. This supremacy, though partly\r\ndue, no doubt, to vast supplies of pie absorbed in youth, may be\r\nattributed to a certain extent also to the national habit of\r\ndancing during meals. Lord Dawlish had that sturdy reverence for\r\nhis interior organism which is the birthright of every Briton. And\r\nat the beginning of supper he had resolved that nothing should\r\ninduce him to court disaster in this fashion. But as the time went\r\non he began to waver.\r\n\r\nThe situation was awkward. Nutty and Miss Leonard were repeatedly\r\nleaving the table to tread the measure, and on these occasions the\r\nGood Sport's wistfulness was a haunting reproach. Nor was the\r\nspectacle of Nutty in action without its effect on Bill's\r\nresolution. Nutty dancing was a sight to stir the most stolid.\r\n\r\nBill wavered. The music had started again now, one of those\r\ntwentieth-century eruptions of sound that begin like a train going\r\nthrough a tunnel and continue like audible electric shocks, that\r\nset the feet tapping beneath the table and the spine thrilling\r\nwith an unaccustomed exhilaration. Every drop of blood in his body\r\ncried to him 'Dance!' He could resist no longer.\r\n\r\n'Shall we?' he said.\r\n\r\nBill should not have danced. He was an estimable young man,\r\nhonest, amiable, with high ideals. He had played an excellent game\r\nof football at the university; his golf handicap was plus two; and\r\nhe was no mean performer with the gloves. But we all of us have\r\nour limitations, and Bill had his. He was not a good dancer. He\r\nwas energetic, but he required more elbow room than the ordinary\r\ndancing floor provides. As a dancer, in fact, he closely resembled\r\na Newfoundland puppy trying to run across a field.\r\n\r\nIt takes a good deal to daunt the New York dancing man, but the\r\ninvasion of the floor by Bill and the Good Sport undoubtedly\r\ncaused a profound and even painful sensation. Linked together they\r\nformed a living projectile which might well have intimidated the\r\nbravest. Nutty was their first victim. They caught him in\r\nmid-step--one of those fancy steps which he was just beginning to\r\nexhume from the cobwebbed recesses of his memory--and swept him\r\naway. After which they descended resistlessly upon a stout\r\ngentleman of middle age, chiefly conspicuous for the glittering\r\ndiamonds which he wore and the stoical manner in which he danced\r\nto and fro on one spot of not more than a few inches in size in\r\nthe exact centre of the room. He had apparently staked out a claim\r\nto this small spot, a claim which the other dancers had decided to\r\nrespect; but Bill and the Good Sport, coming up from behind, had\r\nhim two yards away from it at the first impact. Then, scattering\r\napologies broadcast like a medieval monarch distributing largesse,\r\nBill whirled his partner round by sheer muscular force and began\r\nwhat he intended to be a movement toward the farther corner,\r\nskirting the edge of the floor. It was his simple belief that\r\nthere was more safety there than in the middle.\r\n\r\nHe had not reckoned with Heinrich Joerg. Indeed, he was not aware\r\nof Heinrich Joerg's existence. Yet fate was shortly to bring them\r\ntogether, with far-reaching results. Heinrich Joerg had left the\r\nFatherland a good many years before with the prudent purpose of\r\nescaping military service. After various vicissitudes in the land\r\nof his adoption--which it would be extremely interesting to\r\nrelate, but which must wait for a more favourable opportunity--he\r\nhad secured a useful and not ill-recompensed situation as one of\r\nthe staff of Reigelheimer's Restaurant. He was, in point of fact,\r\na waiter, and he comes into the story at this point bearing a tray\r\nfull of glasses, knives, forks, and pats of butter on little\r\nplates. He was setting a table for some new arrivals, and in order\r\nto obtain more scope for that task he had left the crowded aisle\r\nbeyond the table and come round to the edge of the dancing-floor.\r\n\r\nHe should not have come out on to the dancing-floor. In another\r\nmoment he was admitting that himself. For just as he was lowering\r\nhis tray and bending over the table in the pursuance of his\r\nprofessional duties, along came Bill at his customary high rate\r\nof speed, propelling his partner before him, and for the first\r\ntime since he left home Heinrich was conscious of a regret that he\r\nhad done so. There are worse things than military service!\r\n\r\nIt was the table that saved Bill. He clutched at it and it\r\nsupported him. He was thus enabled to keep the Good Sport from\r\nfalling and to assist Heinrich to rise from the morass of glasses,\r\nknives, and pats of butter in which he was wallowing. Then, the\r\ndance having been abandoned by mutual consent, he helped his now\r\nsomewhat hysterical partner back to their table.\r\n\r\nRemorse came upon Bill. He was sorry that he had danced; sorry\r\nthat he had upset Heinrich; sorry that he had subjected the Good\r\nSport's nervous system to such a strain; sorry that so much glass\r\nhad been broken and so many pats of butter bruised beyond repair.\r\nBut of one thing, even in that moment of bleak regrets, he was\r\ndistinctly glad, and that was that all these things had taken\r\nplace three thousand miles away from Claire Fenwick. He had not\r\nbeen appearing at his best, and he was glad that Claire had not\r\nseen him.\r\n\r\nAs he sat and smoked the remains of his cigar, while renewing his\r\napologies and explanations to his partner and soothing the ruffled\r\nNutty with well-chosen condolences, he wondered idly what Claire\r\nwas doing at that moment.\r\n\r\nClaire at that moment, having been an astonished eye-witness of\r\nthe whole performance, was resuming her seat at a table at the\r\nother end of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons why Lord Dawlish was unaware of Claire\r\nFenwick's presence at Reigelheimer's Restaurant: Reigelheimer's is\r\nsituated in a basement below a ten-storey building, and in order\r\nto prevent this edifice from falling into his patrons' soup the\r\nproprietor had been obliged to shore up his ceiling with massive\r\npillars. One of these protruded itself between the table which\r\nNutty had secured for his supper-party and the table at which\r\nClaire was sitting with her friend, Lady Wetherby, and her steamer\r\nacquaintance, Mr Dudley Pickering. That was why Bill had not seen\r\nClaire from where he sat; and the reason that he had not seen her\r\nwhen he left his seat and began to dance was that he was not one\r\nof your dancers who glance airily about them. When Bill danced he\r\ndanced.\r\n\r\nHe would have been stunned with amazement if he had known that\r\nClaire was at Reigelheimer's that night. And yet it would have\r\nbeen remarkable, seeing that she was the guest of Lady Wetherby,\r\nif she had not been there. When you have travelled three thousand\r\nmiles to enjoy the hospitality of a friend who does near-Greek\r\ndances at a popular restaurant, the least you can do is to go to\r\nthe restaurant and watch her step. Claire had arrived with Polly\r\nWetherby and Mr Dudley Pickering at about the time when Nutty, his\r\ngloom melting rapidly, was instructing the waiter to open the\r\nsecond bottle.\r\n\r\nOf Claire's movements between the time when she secured her ticket\r\nat the steamship offices at Southampton and the moment when she\r\nentered Reigelheimer's Restaurant it is not necessary to give a\r\ndetailed record. She had had the usual experiences of the ocean\r\nvoyager. She had fed, read, and gone to bed. The only notable\r\nevent in her trip had been her intimacy with Mr Dudley Pickering.\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering was a middle-aged Middle Westerner, who by thrift\r\nand industry had amassed a considerable fortune out of automobiles.\r\nEverybody spoke well of Dudley Pickering. The papers spoke well of\r\nhim, Bradstreet spoke well of him, and he spoke well of himself. On\r\nboard the liner he had poured the saga of his life into Claire's\r\nattentive ears, and there was a gentle sweetness in her manner which\r\nencouraged Mr Pickering mightily, for he had fallen in love with\r\nClaire on sight.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that a schoolgirl in these advanced days would know\r\nwhat to do when she found that a man worth millions was in love\r\nwith her; yet there were factors in the situation which gave\r\nClaire pause. Lord Dawlish, of course, was one of them. She had\r\nnot mentioned Lord Dawlish to Mr Pickering, and--doubtless lest\r\nthe sight of it might pain him--she had abstained from wearing her\r\nengagement ring during the voyage. But she had not completely lost\r\nsight of the fact that she was engaged to Bill. Another thing that\r\ncaused her to hesitate was the fact that Dudley Pickering, however\r\nwealthy, was a most colossal bore. As far as Claire could\r\nascertain on their short acquaintance, he had but one subject of\r\nconversation--automobiles.\r\n\r\nTo Claire an automobile was a shiny thing with padded seats, in\r\nwhich you rode if you were lucky enough to know somebody who owned\r\none. She had no wish to go more deeply into the matter. Dudley\r\nPickering's attitude towards automobiles, on the other hand, more\r\nnearly resembled that of a surgeon towards the human body. To him\r\na car was something to dissect, something with an interior both\r\ninteresting to explore and fascinating to talk about. Claire\r\nlistened with a radiant display of interest, but she had her\r\ndoubts as to whether any amount of money would make it worth while\r\nto undergo this sort of thing for life. She was still in this\r\nhesitant frame of mind when she entered Reigelheimer's Restaurant,\r\nand it perturbed her that she could not come to some definite\r\ndecision on Mr Pickering, for those subtle signs which every woman\r\ncan recognize and interpret told her that the latter, having paved\r\nthe way by talking machinery for a week, was about to boil over\r\nand speak of higher things.\r\n\r\nAt the very next opportunity, she was certain, he intended to\r\npropose.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Lady Wetherby acted as a temporary check on the\r\ndevelopment of the situation, but after they had been seated at\r\ntheir table a short time the lights of the restaurant were\r\nsuddenly lowered, a coloured limelight became manifest near the\r\nroof, and classical music made itself heard from the fiddles in\r\nthe orchestra.\r\n\r\nYou could tell it was classical, because the banjo players were\r\nleaning back and chewing gum; and in New York restaurants only\r\ndeath or a classical speciality can stop banjoists.\r\n\r\nThere was a spatter of applause, and Lady Wetherby rose.\r\n\r\n'This,' she explained to Claire, 'is where I do my stunt. Watch\r\nit. I invented the steps myself. Classical stuff. It's called the\r\nDream of Psyche.'\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for one who knew her as Claire did to associate\r\nPolly Wetherby with anything classical. On the road, in England,\r\nwhen they had been fellow-members of the Number Two company of\r\n_The Heavenly Waltz_, Polly had been remarkable chiefly for a\r\nfund of humorous anecdote and a gift, amounting almost to genius,\r\nfor doing battle with militant landladies. And renewing their\r\nintimacy after a hiatus of a little less than a year Claire had\r\nfound her unchanged.\r\n\r\nIt was a truculent affair, this Dream of Psyche. It was not so much\r\ndancing as shadow boxing. It began mildly enough to the accompaniment\r\nof _pizzicato_ strains from the orchestra--Psyche in her training\r\nquarters. _Rallentando_--Psyche punching the bag. _Diminuendo_--Psyche\r\nusing the medicine ball. _Presto_--Psyche doing road work. _Forte_--The\r\nnight of the fight. And then things began to move to a climax. With\r\nthe fiddles working themselves to the bone and the piano bounding\r\nunder its persecutor's blows, Lady Wetherby ducked, side-stepped,\r\nrushed, and sprang, moving her arms in a manner that may have been\r\nclassical Greek, but to the untrained eye looked much more like the\r\nlast round of some open-air bout.\r\n\r\nIt was half-way through the exhibition, when you could smell the\r\nsawdust and hear the seconds shouting advice under the ropes, that\r\nClaire, who, never having seen anything in her life like this\r\nextraordinary performance, had been staring spellbound, awoke to\r\nthe realization that Dudley Pickering was proposing to her. It\r\nrequired a woman's intuition to divine this fact, for Mr Pickering\r\nwas not coherent. He did not go straight to the point. He rambled.\r\nBut Claire understood, and it came to her that this thing had\r\ntaken her before she was ready. In a brief while she would have to\r\ngive an answer of some sort, and she had not clearly decided what\r\nanswer she meant to give.\r\n\r\nThen, while he was still skirting his subject, before he had\r\nwandered to what he really wished to say, the music stopped, the\r\napplause broke out again, and Lady Wetherby returned to the table\r\nlike a pugilist seeking his corner at the end of a round. Her face\r\nwas flushed and she was breathing hard.\r\n\r\n'They pay me money for that!' she observed, genially. 'Can you\r\nbeat it?'\r\n\r\nThe spell was broken. Mr Pickering sank back in his chair in a\r\npunctured manner. And Claire, making monosyllabic replies to her\r\nfriend's remarks, was able to bend her mind to the task of finding\r\nout how she stood on this important Pickering issue. That he would\r\nreturn to the attack as soon as possible she knew; and the next\r\ntime she must have her attitude clearly defined one way or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby, having got the Dance of Psyche out of her system,\r\nand replaced it with a glass of iced coffee, was inclined for\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n'Algie called me up on the phone this evening, Claire.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\nClaire was examining Mr Pickering with furtive side glances. He\r\nwas not handsome, nor, on the other hand, was he repulsive.\r\n'Undistinguished' was the adjective that would have described him.\r\nHe was inclined to stoutness, but not unpardonably so; his hair\r\nwas thin, but he was not aggressively bald; his face was dull, but\r\ncertainly not stupid. There was nothing in his outer man which his\r\nmillions would not offset. As regarded his other qualities, his\r\nconversation was certainly not exhilarating. But that also was\r\nnot, under certain conditions, an unforgivable thing. No, looking\r\nat the matter all round and weighing it with care, the real\r\nobstacle, Claire decided, was not any quality or lack of qualities\r\nin Dudley Pickering--it was Lord Dawlish and the simple fact that\r\nit would be extremely difficult, if she discarded him in favour of a\r\nricher man without any ostensible cause, to retain her self-respect.\r\n\r\n'I think he's weakening.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\nYes, that was the crux of the matter. She wanted to retain her\r\ngood opinion of herself. And in order to achieve that end it was\r\nessential that she find some excuse, however trivial, for breaking\r\noff the engagement.\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\nA waiter approached the table.\r\n\r\n'Mr Pickering!'\r\n\r\nThe thwarted lover came to life with a start.\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'A gentleman wishes to speak to you on the telephone.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes. I was expecting a long-distance call, Lady Wetherby, and\r\nleft word I would be here. Will you excuse me?'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby watched him as he bustled across the room.\r\n\r\n'What do you think of him, Claire?'\r\n\r\n'Mr Pickering? I think he's very nice.'\r\n\r\n'He admires you frantically. I hoped he would. That's why I wanted\r\nyou to come over on the same ship with him.'\r\n\r\n'Polly! I had no notion you were such a schemer.'\r\n\r\n'I would just love to see you two fix it up,' continued Lady\r\nWetherby, earnestly. 'He may not be what you might call a genius,\r\nbut he's a darned good sort; and all his millions help, don't\r\nthey? You don't want to overlook these millions, Claire!'\r\n\r\n'I do like Mr Pickering.'\r\n\r\n'Claire, he asked me if you were engaged.'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'When I told him you weren't, he beamed. Honestly, you've only got\r\nto lift your little finger and--Oh, good Lord, there's Algie!'\r\n\r\nClaire looked up. A dapper, trim little man of about forty was\r\nthreading his way among the tables in their direction. It was a\r\nyear since Claire had seen Lord Wetherby, but she recognized him\r\nat once. He had a red, weather-beaten face with a suspicion of\r\nside-whiskers, small, pink-rimmed eyes with sandy eyebrows, the\r\nsmoothest of sandy hair, and a chin so cleanly shaven that it was\r\ndifficult to believe that hair had ever grown there. Although his\r\nevening-dress was perfect in every detail, he conveyed a subtle\r\nsuggestion of horsiness. He reached the table and sat down without\r\ninvitation in the vacant chair.\r\n\r\n'Pauline!' he said, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n'Algie!' said Lady Wetherby, tensely. 'I don't know what you've\r\ncome here for, and I don't remember asking you to sit down and put\r\nyour elbows on that table, but I want to begin by saying that I\r\nwill not be called Pauline. My name's Polly. You've got a way of\r\nsaying Pauline, as if it were a gentlemanly cuss-word, that makes\r\nme want to scream. And while you're about it, why don't you say\r\nhow-d'you-do to Claire? You ought to remember her, she was my\r\nbridesmaid.'\r\n\r\n'How do you do, Miss Fenwick. Of course, I remember you perfectly.\r\nI'm glad to see you again.'\r\n\r\n'And now, Algie, what is it? Why have you come here?' Lord\r\nWetherby looked doubtfully at Claire. 'Oh, that's all right,' said\r\nLady Wetherby. 'Claire knows all about it--I told her.'\r\n\r\n'Then I appeal to Miss Fenwick, if, as you say, she knows all the\r\nfacts of the case, to say whether it is reasonable to expect a man\r\nof my temperament, a nervous, highly-strung artist, to welcome the\r\npresence of snakes at the breakfast-table. I trust that I am not\r\nan unreasonable man, but I decline to admit that a long, green\r\nsnake is a proper thing to keep about the house.'\r\n\r\n'You had no right to strike the poor thing.'\r\n\r\n'In that one respect I was perhaps a little hasty. I happened to\r\nbe stirring my tea at the moment his head rose above the edge of\r\nthe table. I was not entirely myself that morning. My nerves were\r\nsomewhat disordered. I had lain awake much of the night planning a\r\ncanvas.'\r\n\r\n'Planning a what?'\r\n\r\n'A canvas--a picture.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby turned to Claire.\r\n\r\n'I want you to listen to Algie, Claire. A year ago he did not know\r\none end of a paint-brush from the other. He didn't know he had any\r\nnerves. If you had brought him the artistic temperament on a plate\r\nwith a bit of watercress round it, he wouldn't have recognized it.\r\nAnd now, just because he's got a studio, he thinks he has a right\r\nto go up in the air if you speak to him suddenly and run about the\r\nplace hitting snakes with teaspoons as if he were Michelangelo!'\r\n\r\n'You do me an injustice. It is true that as an artist I developed\r\nlate--But why should we quarrel? If it will help to pave the way\r\nto a renewed understanding between us, I am prepared to apologize\r\nfor striking Clarence. That is conciliatory, I think, Miss\r\nFenwick?'\r\n\r\n'Very.'\r\n\r\n'Miss Fenwick considers my attitude conciliatory.'\r\n\r\n'It's something,' admitted Lady Wetherby, grudgingly.\r\n\r\nLord Wetherby drained the whisky-and-soda which Dudley Pickering\r\nhad left behind him, and seemed to draw strength from it, for he\r\nnow struck a firmer note.\r\n\r\n'But, though expressing regret for my momentary loss of self-control,\r\nI cannot recede from the position I have taken up as regards the\r\nessential unfitness of Clarence's presence in the home.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby looked despairingly at Claire.\r\n\r\n'The very first words I heard Algie speak, Claire, were at\r\nNewmarket during the three o'clock race one May afternoon. He was\r\nhanging over the rail, yelling like an Indian, and what he was\r\nyelling was, \"Come on, you blighter, come on! By the living jingo,\r\nBrickbat wins in a walk!\" And now he's talking about receding from\r\nessential positions! Oh, well, he wasn't an artist then!'\r\n\r\n'My dear Pau--Polly. I am purposely picking my words on the\r\npresent occasion in order to prevent the possibility of further\r\nmisunderstandings. I consider myself an ambassador.'\r\n\r\n'You would be shocked if you knew what I consider you!'\r\n\r\n'I am endeavouring to the best of my ability--'\r\n\r\n'Algie, listen to me! I am quite calm at present, but there's no\r\nknowing how soon I may hit you with a chair if you don't come to\r\nearth quick and talk like an ordinary human being. What is it that\r\nyou are driving at?'\r\n\r\n'Very well, it's this: I'll come home if you get rid of that\r\nsnake.'\r\n\r\n'Never!'\r\n\r\n'It's surely not much to ask of you, Polly?'\r\n\r\n'I won't!'\r\n\r\nLord Wetherby sighed.\r\n\r\n'When I led you to the altar,' he said, reproachfully, 'you\r\npromised to love, honour, and obey me. I thought at the time it\r\nwas a bit of swank!'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby's manner thawed. She became more friendly.\r\n\r\n'When you talk like that, Algie, I feel there's hope for you after\r\nall. That's how you used to talk in the dear old days when you'd\r\ncome to me to borrow half-a-crown to put on a horse! Listen, now\r\nthat at last you seem to be getting more reasonable; I wish I\r\ncould make you understand that I don't keep Clarence for sheer\r\nlove of him. He's a commercial asset. He's an advertisement. You\r\nmust know that I have got to have something to--'\r\n\r\n'I admit that may be so as regards the monkey, Eustace. Monkeys as\r\naids to publicity have, I believe, been tested and found valuable\r\nby other artistes. I am prepared to accept Eustace, but the snake\r\nis worthless.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, you don't object to Eustace, then?'\r\n\r\n'I do strongly, but I concede his uses.'\r\n\r\n'You would live in the same house as Eustace?'\r\n\r\n'I would endeavour to do so. But not in the same house as Eustace\r\nand Clarence.'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n'I don't know that I'm so stuck on Clarence myself,' said Lady\r\nWetherby, weakly.\r\n\r\n'My darling!'\r\n\r\n'Wait a minute. I've not said I would get rid of him.'\r\n\r\n'But you will?'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby's hesitation lasted but a moment. 'All right, Algie.\r\nI'll send him to the Zoo to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'My precious pet!'\r\n\r\nA hand, reaching under the table, enveloped Claire's in a loving\r\nclasp.\r\n\r\nFrom the look on Lord Wetherby's face she supposed that he was\r\nunder the delusion that he was bestowing this attention on his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n'You know, Algie, darling,' said Lady Wetherby, melting completely,\r\n'when you get that yearning note in your voice I just flop and take\r\nthe full count.'\r\n\r\n'My sweetheart, when I saw you doing that Dream of\r\nWhat's-the-girl's-bally-name dance just now, it was all I could\r\ndo to keep from rushing out on to the floor and hugging you.'\r\n\r\n'Algie!'\r\n\r\n'Polly!'\r\n\r\n'Do you mind letting go of my hand, please, Lord Wetherby?' said\r\nClaire, on whom these saccharine exchanges were beginning to have\r\na cloying effect.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Lord Wetherby seemed somewhat confused, but, pulling\r\nhimself together, he covered his embarrassment with a pomposity\r\nthat blended poorly with his horsy appearance.\r\n\r\n'Married life, Miss Fenwick,' he said, 'as you will no doubt\r\ndiscover some day, must always be a series of mutual compromises,\r\nof cheerful give and take. The lamp of love--'\r\n\r\nHis remarks were cut short by a crash at the other end of the\r\nroom. There was a sharp cry and the splintering of glass. The\r\nplace was full of a sudden, sharp confusion. They jumped up with\r\none accord. Lady Wetherby spilled her iced coffee; Lord Wetherby\r\ndropped the lamp of love. Claire, who was nearest the pillar that\r\nseparated them from the part of the restaurant where the accident\r\nhad happened, was the first to see what had taken place.\r\n\r\nA large man, dancing with a large girl, appeared to have charged\r\ninto a small waiter, upsetting him and his tray and the contents\r\nof his tray. The various actors in the drama were now engaged in\r\nsorting themselves out from the ruins. The man had his back toward\r\nher, and it seemed to Claire that there was something familiar\r\nabout that back. Then he turned, and she recognized Lord Dawlish.\r\n\r\nShe stood transfixed. For a moment surprise was her only emotion.\r\nHow came Bill to be in America? Then other feelings blended with\r\nher surprise. It is a fact that Lord Dawlish was looking\r\nsingularly uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nClaire's eyes travelled from Bill to his partner and took in with\r\none swift feminine glance her large, exuberant blondeness. There\r\nis no denying that, seen with a somewhat biased eye, the Good\r\nSport resembled rather closely a poster advertising a revue.\r\n\r\nClaire returned to her seat. Lord and Lady Wetherby continued to\r\ntalk, but she allowed them to conduct the conversation without her\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n'You're very quiet, Claire,' said Polly.\r\n\r\n'I'm thinking.'\r\n\r\n'A very good thing, too, so they tell me. I've never tried it\r\nmyself. Algie, darling, he was a bad boy to leave his nice home,\r\nwasn't he? He didn't deserve to have his hand held.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been a great night for Nutty Boyd. If the vision of his\r\nsister Elizabeth, at home at the farm speculating sadly on the\r\nwhereabouts of her wandering boy, ever came before his mental eye\r\nhe certainly did not allow it to interfere with his appreciation\r\nof the festivities. At Frolics in the Air, whither they moved\r\nafter draining Reigelheimer's of what joys it had to offer, and at\r\nPeale's, where they went after wearying of Frolics in the Air, he\r\nwas in the highest spirits. It was only occasionally that the\r\nrecollection came to vex him that this could not last, that--since\r\nhis Uncle Ira had played him false--he must return anon to the\r\nplace whence he had come.\r\n\r\nWhy, in a city of all-night restaurants, these parties ever break\r\nup one cannot say, but a merciful Providence sees to it that they\r\ndo, and just as Lord Dawlish was contemplating an eternity of the\r\ncompany of Nutty and his two companions, the end came. Miss\r\nLeonard said that she was tired. Her friend said that it was a\r\nshame to go home at dusk like this, but, if the party was going to\r\nbe broken up, she supposed there was nothing else for it. Bill was\r\ntoo sleepy to say anything.\r\n\r\nThe Good Sport lived round the corner, and only required Lord\r\nDawlish's escort for a couple of hundred yards. But Miss Leonard's\r\nhotel was in the neighbourhood of Washington Square, and it was\r\nNutty's pleasing task to drive her thither. Engaged thus, he\r\nreceived a shock that electrified him.\r\n\r\n'That pal of yours,' said Miss Leonard, drowsily--she was\r\nhalf-asleep--'what did you say his name was?'\r\n\r\n'Chalmers, he told me. I only met him to-night.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it isn't; it's something else. It'--Miss Leonard\r\nyawned--'it's Lord something.'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean, \"Lord something\"?'\r\n\r\n'He's a lord--at least, he was when I met him in London.'\r\n\r\n'Are you sure you met him in London?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I'm sure. He was at that supper Captain Delaney gave at\r\nOddy's. There can't be two men in England who dance like that!'\r\n\r\nThe recollection of Bill's performance stimulated Miss Leonard\r\ninto a temporary wakefulness, and she giggled.\r\n\r\n'He danced just the same way that night in London. I wish I could\r\nremember his name. I almost had it a dozen times tonight. It's\r\nsomething with a window in it.'\r\n\r\n'A window?' Nutty's brain was a little fatigued and he felt\r\nhimself unequal to grasping this. 'How do you mean, a window?'\r\n\r\n'No, not a window--a door! I knew it was something about a house.\r\nI know now, his name's Lord Dawlish.'\r\n\r\nNutty's fatigue fell from him like a garment.\r\n\r\n'It can't be!'\r\n\r\n'It is.'\r\n\r\nMiss Leonard's eyes had closed and she spoke in a muffled voice.\r\n\r\n'Are you sure?'\r\n\r\n'Mm-mm.'\r\n\r\n'By gad!'\r\n\r\nNutty was wide awake now and full of inquiries; but his companion\r\nunfortunately was asleep, and he could not put them to her. A\r\ngentleman cannot prod a lady--and his guest, at that--in the ribs\r\nin order to wake her up and ask her questions. Nutty sat back and\r\ngave himself up to feverish thought.\r\n\r\nHe could think of no reason why Lord Dawlish should have come to\r\nAmerica calling himself William Chalmers, but that was no reason\r\nwhy he should not have done so. And Daisy Leonard, who all along\r\nhad remembered meeting him in London, had identified him.\r\n\r\nNutty was convinced. Arriving finally at Miss Leonard's hotel, he\r\nwoke her up and saw her in at the door; then, telling the man to\r\ndrive to the lodgings of his new friend, he urged his mind to\r\nrapid thought. He had decided as a first step in the following up\r\nof this matter to invite Bill down to Elizabeth's farm, and the\r\nthought occurred to him that this had better be done to-night, for\r\nhe knew by experience that on the morning after these little\r\njaunts he was seldom in the mood to seek people out and invite\r\nthem to go anywhere.\r\n\r\nAll the way to the flat he continued to think, and it was\r\nwonderful what possibilities there seemed to be in this little\r\nscheme of courting the society of the man who had robbed him of\r\nhis inheritance. He had worked on Bill's feelings so successfully\r\nas to elicit a loan of a million dollars, and was just proceeding\r\nto marry him to Elizabeth, when the cab stopped with the sudden\r\nsharpness peculiar to New York cabs, and he woke up, to find\r\nhimself at his destination.\r\n\r\nBill was in bed when the bell rang, and received his late host in\r\nhis pyjamas, wondering, as he did so, whether this was the New\r\nYork custom, to foregather again after a party had been broken up,\r\nand chat till breakfast. But Nutty, it seemed, had come with a\r\nmotive, not from a desire for more conversation.\r\n\r\n'Sorry to disturb you, old man,' said Nutty. 'I looked in to tell\r\nyou that I was going down to the country to-morrow. I wondered\r\nwhether you would care to come and spend a day or two with us.'\r\n\r\nBill was delighted. This was better than he had hoped for.\r\n\r\n'Rather!' he said. 'Thanks awfully!'\r\n\r\n'There are plenty of trains in the afternoon,' said Nutty. 'I\r\ndon't suppose either of us will feel like getting up early. I'll\r\ncall for you here at half-past six, and we'll have an early dinner\r\nand catch the seven-fifteen, shall we? We live very simply, you\r\nknow. You won't mind that?'\r\n\r\n'My dear chap!'\r\n\r\n'That's all right, then,' said Nutty, closing the door. 'Good\r\nnight.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth entered Nutty's room and, seating herself on the bed,\r\nsurveyed him with a bright, quiet eye that drilled holes in her\r\nbrother's uneasy conscience. This was her second visit to him that\r\nmorning. She had come an hour ago, bearing breakfast on a tray,\r\nand had departed without saying a word. It was this uncanny\r\nsilence of hers even more than the effects--which still lingered--of\r\nhis revels in the metropolis that had interfered with Nutty's\r\nenjoyment of the morning meal. Never a hearty breakfaster, he had\r\nfound himself under the influence of her wordless disapproval\r\nphysically unable to consume the fried egg that confronted him. He\r\nhad given it one look; then, endorsing the opinion which he had\r\nonce heard a character in a play utter in somewhat similar\r\ncircumstances--that there was nothing on earth so homely as an\r\negg--he had covered it with a handkerchief and tried to pull\r\nhimself round with hot tea. He was now smoking a sad cigarette and\r\nwaiting for the blow to fall.\r\n\r\nHer silence had puzzled him. Though he had tried to give her no\r\nopportunity of getting him alone on the previous evening when he\r\nhad arrived at the farm with Lord Dawlish, he had fully expected\r\nthat she would have broken in upon him with abuse and recrimination\r\nin the middle of the night. Yet she had not done this, nor had she\r\nspoken to him when bringing him his breakfast. These things found\r\ntheir explanation in Elizabeth's character, with which Nutty, though\r\nhe had known her so long, was but imperfectly acquainted. Elizabeth\r\nhad never been angrier with her brother, but an innate goodness of\r\nheart had prevented her falling upon him before he had had rest and\r\nrefreshment.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to massacre him, but at the same time she told herself\r\nthat the poor dear must be feeling very, very ill, and should have\r\na reasonable respite before the slaughter commenced.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that in her opinion this respite had now lasted long\r\nenough. She looked over her shoulder to make sure that she had\r\nclosed the door, then leaned a little forward and spoke.\r\n\r\n'Now, Nutty!'\r\n\r\nThe wretched youth attempted bluster.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean--\"Now, Nutty\"? What's the use of looking at a\r\nfellow like that and saying \"Now, Nutty\"? Where's the sense--'\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed off. He was not a very intelligent young man,\r\nbut even he could see that his was not a position where righteous\r\nindignation could be assumed with any solid chance of success. As\r\na substitute he tried pathos.\r\n\r\n'Oo-oo, my head does ache!'\r\n\r\n'I wish it would burst,' said his sister, unkindly.\r\n\r\n'That's a nice thing to say to a fellow!'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry. I wouldn't have said it--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well!'\r\n\r\n'Only I couldn't think of anything worse.'\r\n\r\nIt began to seem to Nutty that pathos was a bit of a failure too.\r\nAs a last resort he fell back on silence. He wriggled as far down\r\nas he could beneath the sheets and breathed in a soft and wounded\r\nsort of way. Elizabeth took up the conversation.\r\n\r\n'Nutty,' she said, 'I've struggled for years against the\r\nconviction that you were a perfect idiot. I've forced myself,\r\nagainst my better judgement, to try to look on you as sane, but\r\nnow I give in. I can't believe you are responsible for your\r\nactions. Don't imagine that I am going to heap you with reproaches\r\nbecause you sneaked off to New York. I'm not even going to tell\r\nyou what I thought of you for not sending me a telegram, letting\r\nme know where you were. I can understand all that. You were\r\ndisappointed because Uncle Ira had not left you his money, and I\r\nsuppose that was your way of working it off. If you had just run\r\naway and come back again with a headache, I'd have treated you\r\nlike the Prodigal Son. But there are some things which are too\r\nmuch, and bringing a perfect stranger back with you for an\r\nindefinite period is one of them. I'm not saying anything against\r\nMr Chalmers personally. I haven't had time to find out much about\r\nhim, except that he's an Englishman; but he looks respectable.\r\nWhich, as he's a friend of yours, is more or less of a miracle.'\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyebrows as a faint moan of protest came from\r\nbeneath the sheets.\r\n\r\n'You surely,' she said, 'aren't going to suggest at this hour of\r\nthe day, Nutty, that your friends aren't the most horrible set of\r\npests outside a prison? Not that it's likely after all these\r\nmonths that they are outside a prison. You know perfectly well\r\nthat while you were running round New York you collected the most\r\npernicious bunch of rogues that ever fastened their talons into a\r\nsilly child who ought never to have been allowed out without his\r\nnurse.' After which complicated insult Elizabeth paused for\r\nbreath, and there was silence for a space.\r\n\r\n'Well, as I was saying, I know nothing against this Mr Chalmers.\r\nProbably his finger-prints are in the Rogues' Gallery, and he is\r\nbetter known to the police as Jack the Blood, or something, but he\r\nhasn't shown that side of him yet. My point is that, whoever he\r\nis, I do not want him or anybody else coming and taking up his\r\nabode here while I have to be cook and housemaid too. I object to\r\nhaving a stranger on the premises spying out the nakedness of the\r\nland. I am sensitive about my honest poverty. So, darling Nutty,\r\nmy precious Nutty, you poor boneheaded muddler, will you kindly\r\nthink up at your earliest convenience some plan for politely\r\nejecting this Mr Chalmers of yours from our humble home?--because\r\nif you don't, I'm going to have a nervous breakdown.'\r\n\r\nAnd, completely restored to good humour by her own eloquence,\r\nElizabeth burst out laughing. It was a trait in her character\r\nwhich she had often lamented, that she could not succeed in\r\nkeeping angry with anyone for more than a few minutes on end.\r\nSooner or later some happy selection of a phrase of abuse would\r\ntickle her sense of humour, or the appearance of her victim would\r\nbecome too funny not to be laughed at. On the present occasion it\r\nwas the ridiculous spectacle of Nutty cowering beneath the\r\nbedclothes that caused her wrath to evaporate. She made a weak\r\nattempt to recover it. She glared at Nutty, who at the sound of\r\nher laughter had emerged from under the clothes like a worm after\r\na thunderstorm.\r\n\r\n'I mean it,' she said. 'It really is too bad of you! You might\r\nhave had some sense and a little consideration. Ask yourself if we\r\nare in a position here to entertain visitors. Well, I'm going to\r\nmake myself very unpopular with this Mr Chalmers of yours. By this\r\nevening he will be regarding me with utter loathing, for I am\r\nabout to persecute him.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' asked Nutty, alarmed.\r\n\r\n'I am going to begin by asking him to help me open one of the\r\nhives.'\r\n\r\n'For goodness' sake!'\r\n\r\n'After that I shall--with his assistance--transfer some honey. And\r\nafter that--well, I don't suppose he will be alive by then. If he\r\nis, I shall make him wash the dishes for me. The least he can do,\r\nafter swooping down on us like this, is to make himself useful.'\r\n\r\nA cry of protest broke from the appalled Nutty, but Elizabeth did\r\nnot hear it. She had left the room and was on her way downstairs.\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish was smoking an after-breakfast cigar in the grounds.\r\nIt was a beautiful day, and a peaceful happiness had come upon\r\nhim. He told himself that he had made progress. He was under the\r\nsame roof as the girl he had deprived of her inheritance, and it\r\nshould be simple to establish such friendly relations as would\r\nenable him to reveal his identity and ask her to reconsider her\r\nrefusal to relieve him of a just share of her uncle's money. He\r\nhad seen Elizabeth for only a short time on the previous night,\r\nbut he had taken an immediate liking to her. There was something\r\nabout the American girl, he reflected, which seemed to put a man\r\nat his ease, a charm and directness all her own. Yes, he liked\r\nElizabeth, and he liked this dwelling-place of hers. He was quite\r\nwilling to stay on here indefinitely.\r\n\r\nNature had done well by Flack's. The house itself was more\r\npleasing to the eye than most of the houses in those parts, owing\r\nto the black and white paint which decorated it and an unconventional\r\nflattening and rounding of the roof. Nature, too, had made so many\r\nimprovements that the general effect was unusually delightful.\r\n\r\nBill perceived Elizabeth coming toward him from the house. He\r\nthrew away his cigar and went to meet her. Seen by daylight, she\r\nwas more attractive than ever. She looked so small and neat and\r\nwholesome, so extremely unlike Miss Daisy Leonard's friend. And\r\nsuch was the reaction from what might be termed his later\r\nReigelheimer's mood that if he had been asked to define feminine\r\ncharm in a few words, he would have replied without hesitation\r\nthat it was the quality of being as different as possible in every\r\nway from the Good Sport. Elizabeth fulfilled this qualification.\r\nShe was not only small and neat, but she had a soft voice to which\r\nit was a joy to listen.\r\n\r\n'I was just admiring your place,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Its appearance is the best part of it,' said Elizabeth. 'It is a\r\ndeceptive place. The bay looks beautiful, but you can't bathe in\r\nit because of the jellyfish. The woods are lovely, but you daren't\r\ngo near them because of the ticks.'\r\n\r\n'Ticks?'\r\n\r\n'They jump on you and suck your blood,' said Elizabeth, carelessly.\r\n'And the nights are gorgeous, but you have to stay indoors after\r\ndusk because of the mosquitoes.' She paused to mark the effect of\r\nthese horrors on her visitor. 'And then, of course,' she went on,\r\nas he showed no signs of flying to the house to pack his bag and\r\ncatch the next train, 'the bees are always stinging you. I hope you\r\nare not afraid of bees, Mr Chalmers?'\r\n\r\n'Rather not. Jolly little chaps!'\r\n\r\nA gleam appeared in Elizabeth's eye.\r\n\r\n'If you are so fond of them, perhaps you wouldn't mind coming and\r\nhelping me open one of the hives?'\r\n\r\n'Rather!'\r\n\r\n'I'll go and fetch the things.'\r\n\r\nShe went into the house and ran up to Nutty's room, waking that\r\nsufferer from a troubled sleep.\r\n\r\n'Nutty, he's bitten.'\r\n\r\nNutty sat up violently.\r\n\r\n'Good gracious! What by?'\r\n\r\n'You don't understand. What I meant was that I invited your Mr\r\nChalmers to help me open a hive, and he said \"Rather!\" and is\r\nwaiting to do it now. Be ready to say good-bye to him. If he comes\r\nout of this alive, his first act, after bathing the wounds with\r\nammonia, will be to leave us for ever.'\r\n\r\n'But look here, he's a visitor--'\r\n\r\n'Cheer up! He won't be much longer.'\r\n\r\n'You can't let him in for a ghastly thing like opening a hive.\r\nWhen you made me do it that time I was picking stings out of\r\nmyself for a week.'\r\n\r\n'That was because you had been smoking. Bees dislike the smell of\r\ntobacco.'\r\n\r\n'But this fellow may have been smoking.'\r\n\r\n'He has just finished a strong cigar.'\r\n\r\n'For Heaven's sake!'\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, Nutty, dear; I mustn't keep him waiting.'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish looked with interest at the various implements which\r\nshe had collected when she rejoined him outside. He relieved her\r\nof the stool, the smoker, the cotton-waste, the knife, the\r\nscrewdriver, and the queen-clipping cage.\r\n\r\n'Let me carry these for you,' he said, 'unless you've hired a\r\nvan.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth disapproved of this flippancy. It was out of place in\r\none who should have been trembling at the prospect of doom.\r\n\r\n'Don't you wear a veil for this sort of job?'\r\n\r\nAs a rule Elizabeth did. She had reached a stage of intimacy with\r\nher bees which rendered a veil a superfluous precaution, but until\r\nto-day she had never abandoned it. Her view of the matter was\r\nthat, though the inhabitants of the hives were familiar and\r\nfriendly with her by this time and recognized that she came among\r\nthem without hostile intent, it might well happen that among so\r\nmany thousands there might be one slow-witted enough and obtuse\r\nenough not to have grasped this fact. And in such an event a veil\r\nwas better than any amount of explanations, for you cannot stick\r\nto pure reason when quarrelling with bees.\r\n\r\nBut to-day it had struck her that she could hardly protect herself\r\nin this way without offering a similar safeguard to her visitor,\r\nand she had no wish to hedge him about with safeguards.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no,' she said, brightly; 'I'm not afraid of a few bees. Are\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'Rather not!'\r\n\r\n'You know what to do if one of them flies at you?'\r\n\r\n'Well, it would, anyway--what? What I mean to say is, I could\r\nleave most of the doing to the bee.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth was more disapproving than ever. This was mere bravado.\r\nShe did not speak again until they reached the hives.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the hives a vast activity prevailed. What,\r\nheard from afar, had been a pleasant murmur became at close\r\nquarters a menacing tumult. The air was full of bees--bees\r\nsallying forth for honey, bees returning with honey, bees\r\ntrampling on each other's heels, bees pausing in mid-air to pass\r\nthe time of day with rivals on competing lines of traffic.\r\nBlunt-bodied drones whizzed to and fro with a noise like miniature\r\nhigh-powered automobiles, as if anxious to convey the idea of being\r\ntremendously busy without going to the length of doing any actual\r\nwork. One of these blundered into Lord Dawlish's face, and it\r\npleased Elizabeth to observe that he gave a jump.\r\n\r\n'Don't be afraid,' she said, 'it's only a drone. Drones have no\r\nstings.'\r\n\r\n'They have hard heads, though. Here he comes again!'\r\n\r\n'I suppose he smells your tobacco. A drone has thirty-seven\r\nthousand eight hundred nostrils, you know.'\r\n\r\n'That gives him a sporting chance of smelling a cigar--what? I\r\nmean to say, if he misses with eight hundred of his nostrils he's\r\napt to get it with the other thirty-seven thousand.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth was feeling annoyed with her bees. They resolutely\r\ndeclined to sting this young man. Bees flew past him, bees flew\r\ninto him, bees settled upon his coat, bees paused questioningly in\r\nfront of him, as who should say, 'What have we here?' but not a\r\nsingle bee molested him. Yet when Nutty, poor darling, went within\r\na dozen yards of the hives he never failed to suffer for it. In\r\nher heart Elizabeth knew perfectly well that this was because\r\nNutty, when in the presence of the bees, lost his head completely\r\nand behaved like an exaggerated version of Lady Wetherby's Dream\r\nof Psyche, whereas Bill maintained an easy calm; but at the moment\r\nshe put the phenomenon down to that inexplicable cussedness which\r\ndoes so much to exasperate the human race, and it fed her\r\nannoyance with her unbidden guest.\r\n\r\nWithout commenting on his last remark, she took the smoker from\r\nhim and set to work. She inserted in the fire-chamber a handful of\r\nthe cotton-waste and set fire to it; then with a preliminary puff\r\nor two of the bellows to make sure that the conflagration had not\r\ngone out, she aimed the nozzle at the front door of the hive.\r\n\r\nThe results were instantaneous. One or two bee-policemen, who were\r\ndoing fixed point-duty near the opening, scuttled hastily back\r\ninto the hive; and from within came a muffled buzzing as other\r\nbees, all talking at once, worried the perplexed officials with\r\nfoolish questions, a buzzing that became less muffled and more\r\npronounced as Elizabeth lifted the edge of the cover and directed\r\nmore smoke through the crack. This done, she removed the cover,\r\nset it down on the grass beside her, lifted the super-cover and\r\napplied more smoke, and raised her eyes to where Bill stood\r\nwatching. His face wore a smile of pleased interest.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's irritation became painful. She resented his smile. She\r\nhung the smoker on the side of the hive.\r\n\r\n'The stool, please, and the screw-driver.'\r\n\r\nShe seated herself beside the hive and began to loosen the outside\r\nsection. Then taking the brood-frame by the projecting ends, she\r\npulled it out and handed it to her companion. She did it as one\r\nwho plays an ace of trumps.\r\n\r\n'Would you mind holding this, Mr Chalmers?'\r\n\r\nThis was the point in the ceremony at which the wretched Nutty had\r\nbroken down absolutely, and not inexcusably, considering the\r\nseverity of the test. The surface of the frame was black with what\r\nappeared at first sight to be a thick, bubbling fluid of some\r\nsort, pouring viscously to and fro as if some hidden fire had been\r\nlighted beneath it. Only after a closer inspection was it apparent\r\nto the lay eye that this seeming fluid was in reality composed of\r\nmass upon mass of bees. They shoved and writhed and muttered and\r\njostled, for all the world like a collection of home-seeking City\r\nmen trying to secure standing room on the Underground at half-past\r\nfive in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nNutty, making this discovery, had emitted one wild yell, dropped\r\nthe frame, and started at full speed for the house, his retreat\r\nexpedited by repeated stings from the nervous bees. Bill, more\r\nprudent, remained absolutely motionless. He eyed the seething\r\nframe with interest, but without apparent panic.\r\n\r\n'I want you to help me here, Mr Chalmers. You have stronger wrists\r\nthan I have. I will tell you what to do. Hold the frame tightly.'\r\n\r\n'I've got it.'\r\n\r\n'Jerk it down as sharply as you can to within a few inches of the\r\ndoor, and then jerk it up again. You see, that shakes them off.'\r\n\r\n'It would me,' agreed Bill, cordially, 'if I were a bee.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth had the feeling that she had played her ace of trumps\r\nand by some miracle lost the trick. If this grisly operation did\r\nnot daunt the man, nothing, not even the transferring of honey,\r\nwould. She watched him as he raised the frame and jerked it down\r\nwith a strong swiftness which her less powerful wrists had never\r\nbeen able to achieve. The bees tumbled off in a dense shower,\r\nasking questions to the last; then, sighting the familiar entrance\r\nto the hive, they bustled in without waiting to investigate the\r\ncause of the earthquake.\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish watched them go with a kindly interest.\r\n\r\n'It has always been a mystery to me,' he said, 'why they never\r\nseem to think of manhandling the Johnny who does that to them.\r\nThey don't seem able to connect cause and effect. I suppose the\r\nonly way they can figure it out is that the bottom has suddenly\r\ndropped out of everything, and they are so busy lighting out for\r\nhome that they haven't time to go to the root of things. But it's\r\na ticklish job, for all that, if you're not used to it. I know\r\nwhen I first did it I shut my eyes and wondered whether they would\r\nbury my remains or cremate them.'\r\n\r\n'When you first did it?' Elizabeth was staring at him blankly.\r\n'Have you done it before?'\r\n\r\nHer voice shook. Bill met her gaze frankly.\r\n\r\n'Done it before? Rather! Thousands of times. You see, I spent a\r\nyear on a bee-farm once, learning the business.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment mortification was the only emotion of which Elizabeth\r\nwas conscious. She felt supremely ridiculous. For this she had\r\nschemed and plotted--to give a practised expert the opportunity of\r\ndoing what he had done a thousand times before!\r\n\r\nAnd then her mood changed in a flash. Nature has decreed that\r\nthere are certain things in life which shall act as hoops of\r\nsteel, grappling the souls of the elect together. Golf is one of\r\nthese; a mutual love of horseflesh another; but the greatest of\r\nall is bees. Between two beekeepers there can be no strife. Not\r\neven a tepid hostility can mar their perfect communion.\r\n\r\nThe petty enmities which life raises to be barriers between man\r\nand man and between man and woman vanish once it is revealed to\r\nthem that they are linked by this great bond. Envy, malice,\r\nhatred, and all uncharitableness disappear, and they look into\r\neach other's eyes and say 'My brother!'\r\n\r\nThe effect of Bill's words on Elizabeth was revolutionary. They\r\ncrashed through her dislike, scattering it like an explosive\r\nshell. She had resented this golden young man's presence at the\r\nfarm. She had thought him in the way. She had objected to his\r\nbecoming aware that she did such prosaic tasks as cooking and\r\nwashing-up. But now her whole attitude toward him was changed. She\r\nreflected that he was there. He could stay there as long as he\r\nliked, the longer the better.\r\n\r\n'You have really kept bees?'\r\n\r\n'Not actually kept them, worse luck! I couldn't raise the capital.\r\nYou see, money was a bit tight--'\r\n\r\n'I know,' said Elizabeth, sympathetically. 'Money is like that,\r\nisn't it?'\r\n\r\n'The general impression seemed to be that I should be foolish to\r\ntry anything so speculative as beekeeping, so it fell through.\r\nSome very decent old boys got me another job.'\r\n\r\n'What job?'\r\n\r\n'Secretary to a club.'\r\n\r\n'In London, of course?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'And all the time you wanted to be in the country keeping bees!'\r\n\r\nElizabeth could hardly control her voice, her pity was so great.\r\n\r\n'I should have liked it,' said Bill, wistfully. 'London's all\r\nright, but I love the country. My ambition would be to have a\r\nwhacking big farm, a sort of ranch, miles away from anywhere--'\r\n\r\nHe broke off. This was not the first time he had caught himself\r\nforgetting how his circumstances had changed in the past few\r\nweeks. It was ridiculous to be telling hard-luck stories about not\r\nbeing able to buy a farm, when he had the wherewithal to buy\r\ndozens of farms. It took a lot of getting used to, this business\r\nof being a millionaire.\r\n\r\n'That's my ambition too,' said Elizabeth, eagerly. This was the\r\nvery first time she had met a congenial spirit. Nutty's views on\r\nfarming and the Arcadian life generally were saddening to an\r\nenthusiast. 'If I had the money I should get an enormous farm, and\r\nin the summer I should borrow all the children I could find, and\r\ntake them out to it and let them wallow in it.'\r\n\r\n'Wouldn't they do a lot of damage?'\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't mind. I should be too rich to worry about the damage.\r\nIf they ruined the place beyond repair I'd go and buy another.'\r\nShe laughed. 'It isn't so impossible as it sounds. I came very\r\nnear being able to do it.' She paused for a moment, but went on\r\nalmost at once. After all, if you cannot confide your intimate\r\ntroubles to a fellow bee-lover, to whom can you confide them? 'An\r\nuncle of mine--'\r\n\r\nBill felt himself flushing. He looked away from her. He had a\r\nsense of almost unbearable guilt, as if he had just done some\r\nparticularly low crime and was contemplating another.\r\n\r\n'--An uncle of mine would have left me enough money to buy all the\r\nfarms I wanted, only an awful person, an English lord. I wonder if\r\nyou have heard of him?--Lord Dawlish--got hold of uncle somehow\r\nand induced him to make a will leaving all the money to him.'\r\n\r\nShe looked at Bill for sympathy, and was touched to see that he\r\nwas crimson with emotion. He must be a perfect dear to take other\r\npeople's misfortunes to heart like that.\r\n\r\n'I don't know how he managed it,' she went on. 'He must have\r\nworked and plotted and schemed, for Uncle Ira wasn't a weak sort\r\nof man whom you could do what you liked with. He was very\r\nobstinate. But, anyway, this Lord Dawlish succeeded in doing it\r\nsomehow, and then'--her eyes blazed at the recollection--'he had\r\nthe insolence to write to me through his lawyers offering me half.\r\nI suppose he was hoping to satisfy his conscience. Naturally I\r\nrefused it.'\r\n\r\n'But--but--but why?'\r\n\r\n'Why! Why did I refuse it? Surely you don't think I was going to\r\naccept charity from the man who had cheated me?'\r\n\r\n'But--but perhaps he didn't mean it like that. What I mean to say\r\nis--as charity, you know.'\r\n\r\n'He did! But don't let's talk of it any more. It makes me angry to\r\nthink of him, and there's no use spoiling a lovely day like this\r\nby getting angry.'\r\n\r\nBill sighed. He had never dreamed before that it could be so\r\ndifficult to give money away. He was profoundly glad that he had\r\nnot revealed his identity, as he had been on the very point of\r\ndoing just when she began her remarks. He understood now why that\r\ncurt refusal had come in answer to his lawyer's letter. Well,\r\nthere was nothing to do but wait and hope that time might\r\naccomplish something.\r\n\r\n'What do you want me to do next?' he said. 'Why did you open the\r\nhive? Did you want to take a look at the queen?'\r\n\r\nElizabeth hesitated. She blushed with pure shame. She had had but\r\none motive in opening the hive, and that had been to annoy him.\r\nShe scorned to take advantage of the loophole he had provided.\r\nBeekeeping is a freemasonry. A beekeeper cannot deceive a\r\nbrother-mason.\r\n\r\nShe faced him bravely.\r\n\r\n'I didn't want to take a look at anything, Mr Chalmers. I opened\r\nthat hive because I wanted you to drop the frame, as my brother\r\ndid, and get stung, as he was; because I thought that would drive\r\nyou away, because I thought then that I didn't want you down here.\r\nI'm ashamed of myself, and I don't know where I'm getting the\r\nnerve to tell you this. I hope you will stay on--on and on and\r\non.'\r\n\r\nBill was aghast.\r\n\r\n'Good Lord! If I'm in the way--'\r\n\r\n'You aren't in the way.'\r\n\r\n'But you said--'\r\n\r\n'But don't you see that it's so different now? I didn't know then\r\nthat you were fond of bees. You must stay, if my telling you\r\nhasn't made you feel that you want to catch the next train. You\r\nwill save our lives--mine and Nutty's too. Oh, dear, you're\r\nhesitating! You're trying to think up some polite way of getting\r\nout of the place! You mustn't go, Mr Chalmers; you simply must\r\nstay. There aren't any mosquitoes, no jellyfish--nothing! At\r\nleast, there are; but what do they matter? You don't mind them. Do\r\nyou play golf?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'There are links here. You can't go until you've tried them. What\r\nis your handicap?'\r\n\r\n'Plus two.'\r\n\r\n'So is mine.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove! Really?'\r\n\r\nElizabeth looked at him, her eyes dancing.\r\n\r\n'Why, we're practically twin souls, Mr Chalmers! Tell me, I know\r\nyour game is nearly perfect, but if you have a fault, is it a\r\ntendency to putt too hard?'\r\n\r\n'Why, by Jove--yes, it is!'\r\n\r\n'I knew it. Something told me. It's the curse of my life too!\r\nWell, after that you can't go away.'\r\n\r\n'But if I'm in the way--'\r\n\r\n'In the way! Mr Chalmers, will you come in now and help me wash\r\nthe breakfast things?'\r\n\r\n'Rather!' said Lord Dawlish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed their interrupted love-scene at\r\nReigelheimer's Restaurant that night of Lord Dawlish's unfortunate\r\nencounter with the tray-bearing waiter, Dudley Pickering's\r\nbehaviour had perplexed Claire Fenwick. She had taken it for\r\ngranted that next day at the latest he would resume the offer of\r\nhis hand, heart, and automobiles. But time passed and he made no\r\nmove in that direction. Of limousine bodies, carburettors,\r\nspark-plugs, and inner tubes he spoke with freedom and eloquence,\r\nbut the subject of love and marriage he avoided absolutely. His\r\nbehaviour was inexplicable.\r\n\r\nClaire was piqued. She was in the position of a hostess who has\r\nswept and garnished her house against the coming of a guest and\r\nwaits in vain for that guest's arrival. She made up her mind what\r\nto do when Dudley Pickering proposed to her next time, and\r\nthereby, it seemed to her, had removed all difficulties in the\r\nway of that proposal. She little knew her Pickering!\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering was not a self-starter in the motordrome of love.\r\nHe needed cranking. He was that most unpromising of matrimonial\r\nmaterial, a shy man with a cautious disposition. If he overcame\r\nhis shyness, caution applied the foot-brake. If he succeeded in\r\nforgetting caution, shyness shut off the gas. At Reigelheimer's\r\nsome miracle had made him not only reckless but un-self-conscious.\r\nPossibly the Dream of Psyche had gone to his head. At any rate, he\r\nhad been on the very verge of proposing to Claire when the\r\ninterruption had occurred, and in bed that night, reviewing the\r\naffair, he had been appalled at the narrowness of his escape from\r\ntaking a definite step. Except in the way of business, he was a\r\nman who hated definite steps. He never accepted even a dinner\r\ninvitation without subsequent doubts and remorse. The consequence\r\nwas that, in the days that followed the Reigelheimer episode, what\r\nLord Wetherby would have called the lamp of love burned rather low\r\nin Mr Pickering, as if the acetylene were running out. He still\r\nadmired Claire intensely and experienced disturbing emotions when\r\nhe beheld her perfect tonneau and wonderful headlights; but he\r\nregarded her with a cautious fear. Although he sometimes dreamed\r\nsentimentally of marriage in the abstract, of actual marriage, of\r\nmarriage with a flesh-and-blood individual, of marriage that\r\ninvolved clergymen and 'Voices that Breathe o'er Eden,' and\r\ngiggling bridesmaids and cake, Dudley Pickering was afraid with a\r\nterror that woke him sweating in the night. His shyness shrank\r\nfrom the ceremony, his caution jibbed at the mysteries of married\r\nlife. So his attitude toward Claire, the only girl who had\r\nsucceeded in bewitching him into the opening words of an actual\r\nproposal, was a little less cordial and affectionate than if she\r\nhad been a rival automobile manufacturer.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this state when Lady Wetherby, who, having danced\r\nclassical dances for three months without a break, required a\r\nrest, shifted her camp to the house which she had rented for the\r\nsummer at Brookport, Long Island, taking with her Algie, her\r\nhusband, the monkey Eustace, and Claire and Mr Pickering, her\r\nguests. The house was a large one, capable of receiving a big\r\nparty, but she did not wish to entertain on an ambitious scale.\r\nThe only other guest she proposed to put up was Roscoe Sherriff,\r\nher press agent, who was to come down as soon as he could get away\r\nfrom his metropolitan duties.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant and romantic place, the estate which Lady\r\nWetherby had rented. Standing on a hill, the house looked down\r\nthrough green trees on the gleaming waters of the bay. Smooth\r\nlawns and shady walks it had, and rustic seats beneath spreading\r\ncedars. Yet for all its effect on Dudley Pickering it might have\r\nbeen a gasworks. He roamed the smooth lawns with Claire, and sat\r\nwith her on the rustic benches and talked guardedly of lubricating\r\noil. There were moments when Claire was almost impelled to forfeit\r\nwhatever chance she might have had of becoming mistress of thirty\r\nmillion dollars and a flourishing business, for the satisfaction\r\nof administering just one whole-hearted slap on his round and\r\nthinly-covered head.\r\n\r\nAnd then Roscoe Sherriff came down, and Dudley Pickering, who for\r\ndays had been using all his resolution to struggle against the\r\nsiren, suddenly found that there was no siren to struggle against.\r\nNo sooner had the press agent appeared than Claire deserted him\r\nshamelessly and absolutely. She walked with Roscoe Sherriff. Mr\r\nPickering experienced the discomfiting emotions of the man who\r\npushes violently against an abruptly-yielding door, or treads\r\nheavily on the top stair where there is no top stair. He was\r\nshaken, and the clamlike stolidity which he had assumed as\r\nprotection gave way.\r\n\r\nNight had descended upon Brookport. Eustace, the monkey, was in\r\nhis little bed; Lord Wetherby in the smoking-room. It was Sunday,\r\nthe day of rest. Dinner was over, and the remainder of the party\r\nwere gathered in the drawing-room, with the exception of Mr\r\nPickering, who was smoking a cigar on the porch. A full moon\r\nturned Long Island into a fairyland.\r\n\r\nGloom had settled upon Dudley Pickering and he smoked sadly. All\r\nrather stout automobile manufacturers are sad when there is a full\r\nmoon. It makes them feel lonely. It stirs their hearts to thoughts\r\nof love. Marriage loses its terrors for them, and they think\r\nwistfully of hooking some fair woman up the back and buying her\r\nhats. Such was the mood of Mr Pickering, when through the dimness\r\nof the porch there appeared a white shape, moving softly toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Is that you, Mr Pickering?'\r\n\r\nClaire dropped into the seat beside him. From the drawing-room\r\ncame the soft tinkle of a piano. The sound blended harmoniously\r\nwith the quiet peace of the night. Mr Pickering let his cigar go\r\nout and clutched the sides of his chair.\r\n\r\n    Oi'll--er--sing thee saw-ongs ov Arrabee,\r\n      Und--ah ta-ales of farrr Cash-mee-eere,\r\n    Wi-ild tales to che-eat thee ovasigh\r\n      Und charrrrm thee to-oo a tear-er.\r\n\r\nClaire gave a little sigh.\r\n\r\n'What a beautiful voice Mr Sherriff has!'\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering made no reply. He thought Roscoe Sherriff had a\r\nbeastly voice. He resented Roscoe Sherriff's voice. He objected to\r\nRoscoe Sherriff's polluting this fair night with his cacophony.\r\n\r\n'Don't you think so, Mr Pickering?'\r\n\r\n'Uh-huh.'\r\n\r\n'That doesn't sound very enthusiastic. Mr Pickering, I want you to\r\ntell me something. Have I done anything to offend you?'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering started violently.\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'I have seen so little of you these last few days. A little while\r\nago we were always together, having such interesting talks. But\r\nlately it has seemed to me that you have been avoiding me.'\r\n\r\nA feeling of helplessness swept over Mr Pickering. He was vaguely\r\nconscious of a sense of being treated unjustly, of there being a\r\nflaw in Claire's words somewhere if he could only find it, but the\r\nsudden attack had deprived him of the free and unfettered use of\r\nhis powers of reasoning. He gurgled wordlessly, and Claire went\r\non, her low, sad voice mingling with the moonlight in a manner\r\nthat caused thrills to run up and down his spine. He felt\r\nparalyzed. Caution urged him to make some excuse and follow it\r\nwith a bolt to the drawing-room, but he was physically incapable\r\nof taking the excellent advice. Sometimes when you are out in your\r\nPickering Gem or your Pickering Giant the car hesitates, falters,\r\nand stops dead, and your chauffeur, having examined the carburettor,\r\nturns to you and explains the phenomenon in these words: 'The\r\nmixture is too rich.' So was it with Mr Pickering now. The moonlight\r\nalone might not have held him; Claire's voice alone might not have\r\nheld him; but against the two combined he was powerless. The\r\nmixture was too rich. He sat and breathed a little stertorously,\r\nand there came to him that conviction that comes to all of us now\r\nand then, that we are at a crisis of our careers and that the\r\nmoment through which we are living is a moment big with fate.\r\n\r\nThe voice in the drawing-room stopped. Having sung songs of Araby\r\nand tales of far Cashmere, Mr Roscoe Sherriff was refreshing\r\nhimself with a comic paper. But Lady Wetherby, seated at the\r\npiano, still touched the keys softly, and the sound increased the\r\nrichness of the mixture which choked Dudley Pickering's spiritual\r\ncarburettor. It is not fair that a rather stout manufacturer\r\nshould be called upon to sit in the moonlight while a beautiful\r\ngirl, to the accompaniment of soft music, reproaches him with\r\nhaving avoided her.\r\n\r\n'I should be so sorry, Mr Pickering, if I had done anything to\r\nmake a difference between us--'\r\n\r\n'Eh?' said Mr Pickering.\r\n\r\n'I have so few real friends over here.'\r\n\r\nClaire's voice trembled.\r\n\r\n'I--I get a little lonely, a little homesick sometimes--'\r\n\r\nShe paused, musing, and a spasm of pity rent the bosom beneath\r\nDudley Pickering's ample shirt. There was a buzzing in his ears\r\nand a lump choked his throat.\r\n\r\n'Of course, I am loving the life here. I think America's\r\nwonderful, and nobody could be kinder than Lady Wetherby. But--I\r\nmiss my home. It's the first time I have been away for so long. I\r\nfeel very far away sometimes. There are only three of us at home:\r\nmy mother, myself, and my little brother--little Percy.'\r\n\r\nHer voice trembled again as she spoke the last two words, and it\r\nwas possibly this that caused Mr Pickering to visualize Percy as a\r\nsort of little Lord Fauntleroy, his favourite character in English\r\nliterature. He had a vision of a small, delicate, wistful child\r\npining away for his absent sister. Consumptive probably. Or\r\ncurvature of the spine.\r\n\r\nHe found Claire's hand in his. He supposed dully he must have\r\nreached out for it. Soft and warm it lay there, while the universe\r\npaused breathlessly. And then from the semi-darkness beside him\r\nthere came the sound of a stifled sob, and his fingers closed as\r\nif someone had touched a button.\r\n\r\n'We have always been such chums. He is only ten--such a dear boy!\r\nHe must be missing me--'\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and simultaneously Dudley Pickering began to speak.\r\n\r\nThere is this to be said for your shy, cautious man, that on the\r\nrare occasions when he does tap the vein of eloquence that vein\r\nbecomes a geyser. It was as if after years of silence and\r\nmonosyllables Dudley Pickering was endeavouring to restore the\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nHe began by touching on his alleged neglect and avoidance of\r\nClaire. He called himself names and more names. He plumbed the\r\ndepth of repentance and remorse. Proceeding from this, he\r\neulogized her courage, the pluck with which she presented a\r\nsmiling face to the world while tortured inwardly by separation\r\nfrom her little brother Percy. He then turned to his own feelings.\r\n\r\nBut there are some things which the historian should hold sacred,\r\nsome things which he should look on as proscribed material for his\r\npen, and the actual words of a stout manufacturer of automobiles\r\nproposing marriage in the moonlight fall into this class. It is\r\nenough to say that Dudley Pickering was definite. He left no room\r\nfor doubt as to his meaning.\r\n\r\n'Dudley!'\r\n\r\nShe was in his arms. He was embracing her. She was his--the latest\r\nmodel, self-starting, with limousine body and all the newest. No,\r\nno, his mind was wandering. She was his, this divine girl, this\r\nqueen among women, this--\r\n\r\nFrom the drawing-room Roscoe Sherriff's voice floated out in\r\nunconscious comment--\r\n\r\n    Good-bye, boys!\r\n      I'm going to be married to-morrow.\r\n    Good-bye, boys!\r\n      I'm going from sunshine to sorrow.\r\n    No more sitting up till broad daylight.\r\n\r\nDid a momentary chill cool the intensity of Dudley Pickering's\r\nardour? If so he overcame it instantly. He despised Roscoe\r\nSherriff. He flattered himself that he had shown Roscoe Sherriff\r\npretty well who was who and what was what.\r\n\r\nThey would have a wonderful wedding--dozens of clergymen, scores\r\nof organs playing 'The Voice that Breathed o'er Eden,' platoons of\r\nbridesmaids, wagonloads of cake. And then they would go back to\r\nDetroit and live happy ever after. And it might be that in time to\r\ncome there would be given to them little runabouts.\r\n\r\n    I'm going to a life\r\n    Of misery and strife,\r\n    So good-bye, boys!\r\n\r\nHang Roscoe Sherriff! What did he know about it! Confound him!\r\nDudley Pickering turned a deaf ear to the song and wallowed in his\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nClaire walked slowly down the moonlit drive. She had removed\r\nherself from her Dudley's embraces, for she wished to be alone, to\r\nthink. The engagement had been announced. All that part of it was\r\nover--Dudley's stammering speech, the unrestrained delight of\r\nPolly Wetherby, the facetious rendering of 'The Wedding Glide' on\r\nthe piano by Roscoe Sherriff, and it now remained for her to try\r\nto discover a way of conveying the news to Bill.\r\n\r\nIt had just struck her that, though she knew that Bill was in\r\nAmerica, she had not his address.\r\n\r\nWhat was she to do? She must tell him. Otherwise it might quite\r\neasily happen that they might meet in New York when she returned\r\nthere. She pictured the scene. She saw herself walking with Dudley\r\nPickering. Along came Bill. 'Claire, darling!' ... Heavens, what\r\nwould Dudley think? It would be too awful! She couldn't explain.\r\nNo, somehow or other, even if she put detectives on his trail, she\r\nmust find him, and be off with the old love now that she was on\r\nwith the new.\r\n\r\nShe reached the gate and leaned over it. And as she did so someone\r\nin the shadow of a tall tree spoke her name. A man came into the\r\nlight, and she saw that it was Lord Dawlish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish had gone for a moonlight walk that night because,\r\nlike Claire, he wished to be alone to think. He had fallen with a\r\npleasant ease and smoothness into the rather curious life lived at\r\nElizabeth Boyd's bee-farm. A liking for picnics had lingered in\r\nhim from boyhood, and existence at Flack's was one prolonged\r\npicnic. He found that he had a natural aptitude for the more\r\nmuscular domestic duties, and his energy in this direction\r\nenchanted Nutty, who before his advent had had a monopoly of these\r\ntasks.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only aspect of the situation that pleased Nutty.\r\nWhen he had invited Bill to the farm he had had a vague hope that\r\ngood might come of it, but he had never dreamed that things would\r\nturn out as well as they promised to do, or that such a warm and\r\nimmediate friendship would spring up between his sister and the\r\nman who had diverted the family fortune into his own pocket. Bill\r\nand Elizabeth were getting on splendidly. They were together all\r\nthe time--walking, golfing, attending to the numerous needs of the\r\nbees, or sitting on the porch. Nutty's imagination began to run\r\naway with him. He seemed to smell the scent of orange-blossoms, to\r\nhear the joyous pealing of church bells--in fact, with the\r\ndifference that it was not his own wedding that he was anticipating,\r\nhe had begun to take very much the same view of the future that was\r\nabout to come to Dudley Pickering.\r\n\r\nElizabeth would have been startled and embarrassed if she could\r\nhave read his thoughts, for they might have suggested to her that\r\nshe was becoming a great deal fonder of Bill than the shortness of\r\ntheir acquaintance warranted. But though she did not fail to\r\nobserve the strangeness of her brother's manner, she traced it to\r\nanother source than the real one. Nutty had a habit of starting\r\nback and removing himself when, entering the porch, he perceived\r\nthat Bill and his sister were already seated there. His own\r\nimpression on such occasions was that he was behaving with\r\nconsummate tact. Elizabeth supposed that he had had some sort of a\r\nspasm.\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish, if he had been able to diagnose correctly the almost\r\npaternal attitude which had become his host's normal manner these\r\ndays, would have been equally embarrassed but less startled, for\r\nconscience had already suggested to him from time to time that he\r\nhad been guilty of a feeling toward Elizabeth warmer than any\r\nfeeling that should come to an engaged man. Lying in bed at the\r\nend of his first week at the farm, he reviewed the progress of his\r\nfriendship with her, and was amazed at the rapidity with which it\r\nhad grown.\r\n\r\nHe could not conceal it from himself--Elizabeth appealed to him.\r\nBeing built on a large scale himself, he had always been attracted\r\nby small women. There was a smallness, a daintiness, a liveliness\r\nabout Elizabeth that was almost irresistible. She was so capable,\r\nso cheerful in spite of the fact that she was having a hard time.\r\nAnd then their minds seemed to blend so remarkably. There were no\r\nodd corners to be smoothed away. Never in his life had he felt so\r\nsupremely at his ease with one of the opposite sex. He loved\r\nClaire--he drove that fact home almost angrily to himself--but he\r\nwas forced to admit that he had always been aware of something in\r\nthe nature of a barrier between them. Claire was querulous at\r\ntimes, and always a little too apt to take offence. He had never\r\nbeen able to talk to her with that easy freedom that Elizabeth\r\ninvited. Talking to Elizabeth was like talking to an attractive\r\nversion of oneself. It was a thing to be done with perfect\r\nconfidence, without any of that apprehension which Claire inspired\r\nlest the next remark might prove the spark to cause an explosion.\r\nBut Claire was the girl he loved--there must be no mistake about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe came to the conclusion that the key to the situation was the\r\nfact that Elizabeth was American. He had read so much of the\r\nAmerican girl, her unaffectedness, her genius for easy comradeship.\r\nWell, this must be what the writer fellows meant. He had happened\r\nupon one of those delightful friendships without any suspicion of\r\nsex in them of which the American girl had the monopoly. Yes, that\r\nmust be it. It was a comforting explanation. It accounted for his\r\nfeeling at a loose end whenever he was away from Elizabeth for as\r\nmuch as half an hour. It accounted for the fact that they understood\r\neach other so well. It accounted for everything so satisfactorily\r\nthat he was able to get to sleep that night after all.\r\n\r\nBut next morning--for his conscience was one of those persistent\r\nconsciences--he began to have doubts again. Nothing clings like a\r\nsuspicion in the mind of a conscientious young man that he has\r\nbeen allowing his heart to stray from its proper anchorage.\r\n\r\nCould it be that he was behaving badly toward Claire? The thought\r\nwas unpleasant, but he could not get rid of it. He extracted\r\nClaire's photograph from his suit-case and gazed solemnly upon it.\r\n\r\nAt first he was shocked to find that it only succeeded in\r\nconvincing him that Elizabeth was quite the most attractive girl\r\nhe ever had met. The photographer had given Claire rather a severe\r\nlook. He had told her to moisten the lips with the tip of the\r\ntongue and assume a pleasant smile, with the result that she\r\nseemed to glare. She had a rather markedly aggressive look,\r\nqueenly perhaps, but not very comfortable.\r\n\r\nBut there is no species of self-hypnotism equal to that of a man\r\nwho gazes persistently at a photograph with the preconceived idea\r\nthat he is in love with the original of it. Little by little Bill\r\nfound that the old feeling began to return. He persevered. By the\r\nend of a quarter of an hour he had almost succeeded in capturing\r\nanew that first fine careless rapture which, six months ago, had\r\ncaused him to propose to Claire and walk on air when she accepted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe continued the treatment throughout the day, and by dinner-time\r\nhad arranged everything with his conscience in the most satisfactory\r\nmanner possible. He loved Claire with a passionate fervour; he\r\nliked Elizabeth very much indeed. He submitted this diagnosis to\r\nconscience, and conscience graciously approved and accepted it.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday that day. That helped. There is nothing like Sunday\r\nin a foreign country for helping a man to sentimental thoughts of\r\nthe girl he has left behind him elsewhere. And the fact that there\r\nwas a full moon clinched it. Bill was enabled to go for an\r\nafter-dinner stroll in a condition of almost painful loyalty to Claire.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, as he walked along the road, he took out the\r\nphotograph and did some more gazing. The last occasion on which he\r\ndid this was just as he emerged from the shadow of a large tree\r\nthat stood by the roadside, and a gush of rich emotion rewarded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Claire!' he murmured.\r\n\r\nAn exclamation at his elbow caused him to look up. There, leaning\r\nover a gate, the light of the moon falling on her beautiful face,\r\nstood Claire herself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nIn trying interviews, as in sprint races, the start is everything.\r\nIt was the fact that she recovered more quickly from her\r\nastonishment that enabled Claire to dominate her scene with Bill.\r\nShe had the advantage of having a less complicated astonishment to\r\nrecover from, for, though it was a shock to see him there when she\r\nhad imagined that he was in New York, it was not nearly such a\r\nshock as it was to him to see her here when he had imagined that\r\nshe was in England. She had adjusted her brain to the situation\r\nwhile he was still gaping.\r\n\r\n'Well, Bill?'\r\n\r\nThis speech in itself should have been enough to warn Lord Dawlish\r\nof impending doom. As far as love, affection, and tenderness are\r\nconcerned, a girl might just as well hit a man with an axe as say\r\n'Well, Bill?' to him when they have met unexpectedly in the\r\nmoonlight after long separation. But Lord Dawlish was too shattered\r\nby surprise to be capable of observing _nuances_. If his love had\r\never waned or faltered, as conscience had suggested earlier in the\r\nday, it was at full blast now.\r\n\r\n'Claire!' he cried.\r\n\r\nHe was moving to take her in his arms, but she drew back.\r\n\r\n'No, really, Bill!' she said; and this time it did filter through\r\ninto his disordered mind that all was not well. A man who is a\r\ngood deal dazed at the moment may fail to appreciate a remark like\r\n'Well, Bill?' but for a girl to draw back and say, 'No, really,\r\nBill!' in a tone not exactly of loathing, but certainly of pained\r\naversion, is a deliberately unfriendly act. The three short words,\r\ntaken in conjunction with the movement, brought him up with as\r\nsharp a turn as if she had punched him in the eye.\r\n\r\n'Claire! What's the matter?'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him steadily. She looked at him with a sort of\r\nqueenly woodenness, as if he were behind a camera with a velvet\r\nbag over his head and had just told her to moisten the lips with\r\nthe tip of the tongue. Her aspect staggered Lord Dawlish. A\r\ncursory inspection of his conscience showed nothing but purity and\r\nwhiteness, but he must have done something, or she would not be\r\nstaring at him like this.\r\n\r\n'I don't understand!' was the only remark that occurred to him.\r\n\r\n'Are you sure?'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I was at Reigelheimer's Restaurant--Ah!'\r\n\r\nThe sudden start which Lord Dawlish had given at the opening words\r\nof her sentence justified the concluding word. Innocent as his\r\nbehaviour had been that night at Reigelheimer's, he had been glad\r\nat the time that he had not been observed. It now appeared that he\r\nhad been observed, and it seemed to him that Long Island suddenly\r\nflung itself into a whirling dance. He heard Claire speaking a\r\nlong way off: 'I was there with Lady Wetherby. It was she who\r\ninvited me to come to America. I went to the restaurant to see her\r\ndance--and I saw you!'\r\n\r\nWith a supreme effort Bill succeeded in calming down the excited\r\nlandscape. He willed the trees to stop dancing, and they came\r\nreluctantly to a standstill. The world ceased to swim and flicker.\r\n\r\n'Let me explain,' he said.\r\n\r\nThe moment he had said the words he wished he could recall them.\r\nTheir substance was right enough; it was the sound of them that\r\nwas wrong. They sounded like a line from a farce, where the erring\r\nhusband has been caught by the masterful wife. They were\r\nridiculous. Worse than being merely ridiculous, they created an\r\natmosphere of guilt and evasion.\r\n\r\n'Explain! How can you explain? It is impossible to explain. I saw\r\nyou with my own eyes making an exhibition of yourself with a\r\nhorrible creature in salmon-pink. I'm not asking you who she is.\r\nI'm not questioning you about your relations with her at all. I\r\ndon't care who she was. The mere fact that you were at a public\r\nrestaurant with a person of that kind is enough. No doubt you\r\nthink I am making a great deal of fuss about a very ordinary\r\nthing. You consider that it is a man's privilege to do these\r\nthings, if he can do them without being found out. But it ended\r\neverything so far as I am concerned. Am I unreasonable? I don't\r\nthink so. You steal off to America, thinking I am in England, and\r\nbehave like this. How could you do that if you really loved me?\r\nIt's the deceit of it that hurts me.'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish drew in a few breaths of pure Long Island air, but he\r\ndid not speak. He felt helpless. If he were to be allowed to\r\nwithdraw into the privacy of the study and wrap a cold, wet towel\r\nabout his forehead and buckle down to it, he knew that he could\r\ndraft an excellent and satisfactory explanation of his presence at\r\nReigelheimer's with the Good Sport. But to do it on the spur of\r\nthe moment like this was beyond him.\r\n\r\nClaire was speaking again. She had paused for a while after her\r\nrecent speech, in order to think of something else to say; and\r\nduring this pause had come to her mind certain excerpts from one\r\nof those admirable articles on love, by Luella Delia Philpotts,\r\nwhich do so much to boost the reading public of the United States\r\ninto the higher planes. She had read it that afternoon in the\r\nSunday paper, and it came back to her now.\r\n\r\n'I may be hypersensitive,' she said, dropping her voice from the\r\naccusatory register to the lower tones of pathos, 'but I have such\r\nhigh ideals of love. There can be no true love where there is not\r\nperfect trust. Trust is to love what--'\r\n\r\nShe paused again. She could not remember just what Luella Delia\r\nPhilpotts had said trust was to love. It was something extremely\r\nneat, but it had slipped her memory.\r\n\r\n'A woman has the right to expect the man she is about to marry to\r\nregard their troth as a sacred obligation that shall keep him as\r\npure as a young knight who has dedicated himself to the quest of\r\nthe Holy Grail. And I find you in a public restaurant, dancing\r\nwith a creature with yellow hair, upsetting waiters, and\r\nstaggering about with pats of butter all over you.'\r\n\r\nHere a sense of injustice stung Lord Dawlish. It was true that\r\nafter his regrettable collision with Heinrich, the waiter, he had\r\ndiscovered butter upon his person, but it was only one pat. Claire\r\nhad spoken as if he had been festooned with butter.\r\n\r\n'I am not angry with you, only disappointed. What has happened has\r\nshown me that you do not really love me, not as I think of love.\r\nOh, I know that when we are together you think you do, but absence\r\nis the test. Absence is the acid-test of love that separates the\r\nbase metal from the true. After what has happened, we can't go on\r\nwith our engagement. It would be farcical. I could never feel that\r\nway toward you again. We shall always be friends, I hope. But as\r\nfor love--love is not a machine. It cannot be shattered and put\r\ntogether again.'\r\n\r\nShe turned and began to walk up the drive. Hanging over the top of\r\nthe gate like a wet sock, Lord Dawlish watched her go. The\r\ninterview was over, and he could not think of one single thing to\r\nsay. Her white dress made a patch of light in the shadows. She\r\nmoved slowly, as if weighed down by sad thoughts, like one who, as\r\nLuella Delia Philpotts beautifully puts it, paces with measured\r\nstep behind the coffin of a murdered heart. The bend of the drive\r\nhid her from his sight.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty minutes later Dudley Pickering, smoking sentimentally\r\nin the darkness hard by the porch, received a shock. He was musing\r\ntenderly on his Claire, who was assisting him in the process by\r\nsinging in the drawing-room, when he was aware of a figure, the\r\nsinister figure of a man who, pressed against the netting of the\r\nporch, stared into the lighted room beyond.\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering's first impulse was to stride briskly up to the\r\nintruder, tap him on the shoulder, and ask him what the devil he\r\nwanted; but a second look showed him that the other was built on\r\ntoo ample a scale to make this advisable. He was a large,\r\nfit-looking intruder.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering was alarmed. There had been the usual epidemic of\r\nburglaries that season. Houses had been broken into, valuable\r\npossessions removed. In one case a negro butler had been struck\r\nover the head with a gas-pipe and given a headache. In these\r\ncircumstances, it was unpleasant to find burly strangers looking\r\nin at windows.\r\n\r\n'Hi!' cried Mr Pickering.\r\n\r\nThe intruder leaped a foot. It had not occurred to Lord Dawlish,\r\nwhen in an access of wistful yearning he had decided to sneak up\r\nto the house in order to increase his anguish by one last glimpse\r\nof Claire, that other members of the household might be out in the\r\ngrounds. He was just thinking sorrowfully, as he listened to the\r\nmusic, how like his own position was to that of the hero of\r\nTennyson's _Maud_--a poem to which he was greatly addicted,\r\nwhen Mr Pickering's 'Hi!' came out of nowhere and hit him like a\r\ntorpedo.\r\n\r\nHe turned in agitation. Mr Pickering having prudently elected to\r\nstay in the shadows, there was no one to be seen. It was as if the\r\nvoice of conscience had shouted 'Hi!' at him. He was just\r\nwondering if he had imagined the whole thing, when he perceived\r\nthe red glow of a cigar and beyond it a shadowy form.\r\n\r\nIt was not the fact that he was in an equivocal position, staring\r\ninto a house which did not belong to him, with his feet on\r\nsomebody else's private soil, that caused Bill to act as he did.\r\nIt was the fact that at that moment he was not feeling equal to\r\nconversation with anybody on any subject whatsoever. It did not\r\noccur to him that his behaviour might strike a nervous stranger as\r\nsuspicious. All he aimed at was the swift removal of himself from\r\na spot infested by others of his species. He ran, and Mr\r\nPickering, having followed him with the eye of fear, went rather\r\nshakily into the house, his brain whirling with professional\r\ncracksmen and gas pipes and assaulted butlers, to relate his\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n'A great, hulking, ruffianly sort of fellow glaring in at the\r\nwindow,' said Mr Pickering. 'I shouted at him and he ran like a\r\nrabbit.'\r\n\r\n'Gee! Must have been one of the gang that's been working down\r\nhere,' said Roscoe Sherriff. 'There might be a quarter of a column\r\nin that, properly worked, but I guess I'd better wait until he\r\nactually does bust the place.'\r\n\r\n'We must notify the police!'\r\n\r\n'Notify the police, and have them butt in and stop the thing and\r\nkill a good story!' There was honest amazement in the Press-agent's\r\nvoice. 'Let me tell you, it isn't so easy to get publicity\r\nthese days that you want to go out of your way to stop it!'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering was appalled. A dislike of this man, which had grown\r\nless vivid since his scene with Claire, returned to him with\r\nredoubled force.\r\n\r\n'Why, we may all be murdered in our beds!' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Front-page stuff!' said Roscoe Sherriff, with gleaming eyes. 'And\r\nthree columns at least. Fine!'\r\n\r\nIt might have consoled Lord Dawlish somewhat, as he lay awake\r\nthat night, to have known that the man who had taken Claire from\r\nhim--though at present he was not aware of such a man's\r\nexistence--also slept ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby sat in her room, writing letters. The rest of the\r\nhousehold were variously employed. Roscoe Sherriff was prowling\r\nabout the house, brooding on campaigns of publicity. Dudley\r\nPickering was walking in the grounds with Claire. In a little\r\nshack in the woods that adjoined the high-road, which he had\r\nconverted into a temporary studio, Lord Wetherby was working on a\r\npicture which he proposed to call 'Innocence', a study of a small\r\nItalian child he had discovered in Washington Square. Lady\r\nWetherby, who had been taken to see the picture, had suggested\r\n'The Black Hand's Newest Recruit' as a better title than the one\r\nselected by the artist.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact to be noted that of the entire household only Lady\r\nWetherby could fairly be described as happy. It took very little to\r\nmake Lady Wetherby happy. Fine weather, good food, and a complete\r\nabstention from classical dancing--give her these and she asked no\r\nmore. She was, moreover, delighted at Claire's engagement. It\r\nseemed to her, for she had no knowledge of the existence of Lord\r\nDawlish, a genuine manifestation of Love's Young Dream. She liked\r\nDudley Pickering and she was devoted to Claire. It made her happy\r\nto think that it was she who had brought them together.\r\n\r\nBut of the other members of the party, Dudley Pickering was\r\nunhappy because he feared that burglars were about to raid the\r\nhouse; Roscoe Sherriff because he feared they were not; Claire\r\nbecause, now that the news of the engagement was out, it seemed to\r\nbe everybody's aim to leave her alone with Mr Pickering, whose\r\nundiluted society tended to pall. And Lord Wetherby was unhappy\r\nbecause he found Eustace, the monkey, a perpetual strain upon his\r\nartistic nerves. It was Eustace who had driven him to his shack in\r\nthe woods. He could have painted far more comfortably in the\r\nhouse, but Eustace had developed a habit of stealing up to him and\r\nplucking the leg of his trousers; and an artist simply cannot give\r\nof his best with that sort of thing going on.\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby wrote on. She was not fond of letter-writing and she\r\nhad allowed her correspondence to accumulate; but she was\r\ndisposing of it in an energetic and conscientious way, when the\r\nentrance of Wrench, the butler, interrupted her.\r\n\r\nWrench had been imported from England at the request of Lord\r\nWetherby, who had said that it soothed him and kept him from\r\nfeeling home-sick to see a butler about the place. Since then he\r\nhad been hanging to the establishment as it were by a hair. He\r\ngave the impression of being always on the point of giving notice.\r\nThere were so many things connected with his position of which he\r\ndisapproved. He had made no official pronouncement of the matter,\r\nbut Lady Wetherby knew that he disapproved of her classical\r\ndancing. His last position had been with the Dowager Duchess of\r\nWaveney, the well-known political hostess, who--even had the\r\nsomewhat generous lines on which she was built not prevented the\r\npossibility of such a thing--would have perished rather than dance\r\nbarefooted in a public restaurant. Wrench also disapproved of\r\nAmerica. That fact had been made plain immediately upon his\r\narrival in the country. He had given America one look, and then\r\nhis mind was made up--he disapproved of it.\r\n\r\n'If you please, m'lady!'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby turned. The butler was looking even more than\r\nusually disapproving, and his disapproval had, so to speak,\r\ncrystallized, as if it had found some more concrete and definite\r\nobjective than either barefoot dancing or the United States.\r\n\r\n'If you please, m'lady--the hape!'\r\n\r\nIt was Wrench's custom to speak of Eustace in a tone of restrained\r\ndisgust. He disapproved of Eustace. The Dowager Duchess of\r\nWaveney, though she kept open house for members of Parliament,\r\nwould have drawn the line at monkeys.\r\n\r\n'The hape is behaving very strange, m'lady,' said Wrench,\r\nfrostily.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that in this world there is always\r\nsomething. A moment before, Lady Wetherby had been feeling\r\ncompletely contented, without a care on her horizon. It was\r\nfoolish of her to have expected such a state of things to last,\r\nfor what is life but a series of sharp corners, round each of\r\nwhich Fate lies in wait for us with a stuffed eel-skin? Something\r\nin the butler's manner, a sort of gloating gloom which he\r\nradiated, told her that she had arrived at one of these corners\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n'The hape is seated on the kitchen-sink, m'lady, throwing new-laid\r\neggs at the scullery-maid, and cook desired me to step up and ask\r\nfor instructions.'\r\n\r\n'What!' Lady Wetherby rose in agitation. 'What's he doing that\r\nfor?' she asked, weakly.\r\n\r\nA slight, dignified gesture was Wrench's only reply. It was not\r\nhis place to analyse the motives of monkeys.\r\n\r\n'Throwing eggs!'\r\n\r\nThe sight of Lady Wetherby's distress melted the butler's stern\r\nreserve. He unbent so far as to supply a clue.\r\n\r\n'As I understand from cook, m'lady, the animal appears to have\r\ntaken umbrage at a lack of cordiality on the part of the cat. It\r\nseems that the hape attempted to fondle the cat, but the latter\r\nscratched him; being suspicious,' said Wrench, 'of his _bona\r\nfides_.' He scrutinized the ceiling with a dull eye. 'Whereupon,'\r\nhe continued, 'he seized her tail and threw her with considerable\r\nforce. He then removed himself to the sink and began to hurl eggs\r\nat the scullery-maid.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby's mental eye attempted to produce a picture of the\r\nscene, but failed.\r\n\r\n'I suppose I had better go down and see about it,' she said.\r\n\r\nWrench withdrew his gaze from the ceiling.\r\n\r\n'I think it would be advisable, m'lady. The scullery-maid is\r\nalready in hysterics.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby led the way to the kitchen. She was wroth with\r\nEustace. This was just the sort of thing out of which Algie would\r\nbe able to make unlimited capital. It weakened her position with\r\nAlgie. There was only one thing to do--she must hush it up.\r\n\r\nHer first glance, however, at the actual theatre of war gave her\r\nthe impression that matters had advanced beyond the hushing-up\r\nstage. A yellow desolation brooded over the kitchen. It was not so\r\nmuch a kitchen as an omelette. There were eggs everywhere, from\r\nfloor to ceiling. She crunched her way in on a carpet of oozing\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nHer entry was a signal for a renewal on a more impressive scale of\r\nthe uproar that she had heard while opening the door. The air was\r\nfull of voices. The cook was expressing herself in Norwegian, the\r\nparlour-maid in what appeared to be Erse. On a chair in a corner\r\nthe scullery-maid sobbed and whooped. The odd-job man, who was a\r\nbaseball enthusiast, was speaking in terms of high praise of\r\nEustace's combined speed and control.\r\n\r\nThe only calm occupant of the room was Eustace himself, who,\r\neither through a shortage of ammunition or through weariness of\r\nthe pitching-arm, had suspended active hostilities, and was now\r\nlooking down on the scene from a high shelf. There was a brooding\r\nexpression in his deep-set eyes. He massaged his right ear with\r\nthe sole of his left foot in a somewhat _distrait_ manner.\r\n\r\n'Eustace!' cried Lady Wetherby, severely.\r\n\r\nEustace lowered his foot and gazed at her meditatively, then at\r\nthe odd-job man, then at the scullery-maid, whose voice rose high\r\nabove the din.\r\n\r\n'I rather fancy, m'lady,' said Wrench, dispassionately, 'that the\r\nanimal is about to hurl a plate.'\r\n\r\nIt had escaped the notice of those present that the shelf on which\r\nthe rioter had taken refuge was within comfortable reach of the\r\ndresser, but Eustace himself had not overlooked this important\r\nstrategic point. As the butler spoke, Eustace picked up a plate\r\nand threw it at the scullery-maid, whom he seemed definitely to\r\nhave picked out as the most hostile of the allies. It was a fast\r\ninshoot, and hit the wall just above her head.\r\n\r\n''At-a-boy!' said the odd-job man, reverently.\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby turned on him with some violence. His detached\r\nattitude was the most irritating of the many irritating aspects of\r\nthe situation. She paid this man a weekly wage to do odd jobs. The\r\ncapture of Eustace was essentially an odd job. Yet, instead of\r\ndoing it, he hung about with the air of one who has paid his\r\nhalf-dollar and bought his bag of peanuts and has now nothing to\r\ndo but look on and enjoy himself.\r\n\r\n'Why don't you catch him?' she cried.\r\n\r\nThe odd-job man came out of his trance. A sudden realization came\r\nupon him that life was real and life was earnest, and that if he\r\ndid not wish to jeopardize a good situation he must bestir\r\nhimself. Everybody was looking at him expectantly. It seemed to be\r\ndefinitely up to him. It was imperative that, whatever he did, he\r\nshould do it quickly. There was an apron hanging over the back of\r\na chair. More with the idea of doing something than because he\r\nthought he would achieve anything definite thereby, he picked up\r\nthe apron and flung it at Eustace. Luck was with him. The apron\r\nenveloped Eustace just as he was winding up for another inshoot\r\nand was off his balance. He tripped and fell, clutched at the\r\napron to save himself, and came to the ground swathed in it,\r\ngiving the effect of an apron mysteriously endowed with life. The\r\ntriumphant odd-job man, pressing his advantage like a good\r\ngeneral, gathered up the ends, converted it into a rude bag, and\r\none more was added to the long list of the victories of the human\r\nover the brute intelligence.\r\n\r\nEverybody had a suggestion now. The cook advocated drowning. The\r\nparlour-maid favoured the idea of hitting the prisoner with a\r\nbroom-handle. Wrench, eyeing the struggling apron disapprovingly,\r\nmentioned that Mr Pickering had bought a revolver that morning.\r\n\r\n'Put him in the coal-cellar,' said Lady Wetherby.\r\n\r\nWrench was more far-seeing.\r\n\r\n'If I might offer the warning, m'lady,' said Wrench, 'not the\r\ncellar. It is full of coal. It would be placing temptation in the\r\nanimal's way.'\r\n\r\nThe odd-job man endorsed this.\r\n\r\n'Put him in the garage, then,' said Lady Wetherby.\r\n\r\nThe odd-job man departed, bearing his heaving bag at arm's length.\r\nThe cook and the parlour-maid addressed themselves to comforting\r\nand healing the scullery-maid. Wrench went off to polish silver,\r\nLady Wetherby to resume her letters. The cat was the last of the\r\nparty to return to the normal. She came down from the chimney an\r\nhour later covered with soot, demanding restoratives.\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby finished her letters. She cut them short, for\r\nEustace's insurgence had interfered with her flow of ideas. She\r\nwent into the drawing-room, where she found Roscoe Sherriff\r\nstrumming on the piano.\r\n\r\n'Eustace has been raising Cain,' she said.\r\n\r\nThe Press-agent looked up hopefully. He had been wearing a rather\r\npreoccupied air.\r\n\r\n'How's that?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Throwing eggs and plates in the kitchen.'\r\n\r\nThe gleam of interest which had come into Roscoe Sherriff's face\r\ndied out.\r\n\r\n'You couldn't get more than a fill-in at the bottom of a column on\r\nthat,' he said, regretfully. 'I'm a little disappointed in that\r\nmonk. I hoped he would pan out bigger. Well, I guess we've just\r\ngot to give him time. I have an idea that he'll set the house on\r\nfire or do something with a punch like that one of these days. You\r\nmustn't get discouraged. Why, that puma I made Valerie Devenish\r\nkeep looked like a perfect failure for four whole months. A child\r\ncould have played with it. Miss Devenish called me up on the\r\nphone, I remember, and said she was darned if she was going to\r\nspend the rest of her life maintaining an animal that might as\r\nwell be stuffed for all the liveliness it showed, and that she was\r\ngoing right out to buy a white mouse instead. Fortunately, I\r\ntalked her round.\r\n\r\n'A few weeks later she came round and thanked me with tears in her\r\neyes. The puma had suddenly struck real mid-season form. It clawed\r\nthe elevator-boy, bit a postman, held up the traffic for miles,\r\nand was finally shot by a policeman. Why, for the next few days\r\nthere was nothing in the papers at all but Miss Devenish and her\r\npuma. There was a war on at the time in Mexico or somewhere, and\r\nwe had it backed off the front page so far that it was over before\r\nit could get back. So, you see, there's always hope. I've been\r\nnursing the papers with bits about Eustace, so as to be ready for\r\nthe grand-stand play when it comes--and all we can do is to wait.\r\nIt's something if he's been throwing eggs. It shows he's waking\r\nup.'\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Lord Wetherby entered. He looked fatigued. He\r\nsank into a chair and sighed.\r\n\r\n'I cannot get it,' he said. 'It eludes me.'\r\n\r\nHe lapsed into a sombre silence.\r\n\r\n'What can't you get?' said Lady Wetherby, cautiously.\r\n\r\n'The expression--the expression I want to get into the child's\r\neyes in my picture, \"Innocence\".'\r\n\r\n'But you have got it.'\r\n\r\nLord Wetherby shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Well, you had when I saw the picture,' persisted Lady Wetherby.\r\n'This child you're painting has just joined the Black Hand. He\r\nhas been rushed in young over the heads of the waiting list\r\nbecause his father had a pull. Naturally the kid wants to do\r\nsomething to justify his election, and he wants to do it quick.\r\nYou have caught him at the moment when he sees an old gentleman\r\ncoming down the street and realizes that he has only got to sneak\r\nup and stick his little knife--'\r\n\r\n'My dear Polly, I welcome criticism, but this is more--'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby stroked his coat-sleeve fondly.\r\n\r\n'Never mind, Algie, I was only joking, precious. I thought the\r\npicture was coming along fine when you showed it to me. I'll come\r\nand take another look at it.'\r\n\r\nLord Wetherby shook his head.\r\n\r\n'I should have a model. An artist cannot mirror Nature properly\r\nwithout a model. I wish you would invite that child down here.'\r\n\r\n'No, Algie, there are limits. I wouldn't have him within a mile\r\nof the place.'\r\n\r\n'Yet you keep Eustace.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you made me engage Wrench. It's fifty-fifty. I wish you\r\nwouldn't keep picking on Eustace, Algie dear. He does no harm. Mr\r\nSherriff and I were just saying how peaceable he is. He wouldn't\r\nhurt--'\r\n\r\nClaire came in.\r\n\r\n'Polly,' she said, 'did you put that monkey of yours in the\r\ngarage? He's just bitten Dudley in the leg.'\r\n\r\nLord Wetherby uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n'Now perhaps--'\r\n\r\n'We went in just now to have a look at the car,' continued\r\nClaire. 'Dudley wanted to show me the commutator on the exhaust-box\r\nor the windscreen, or something, and he was just bending over\r\nwhen Eustace jumped out from nowhere and pinned him. I'm afraid he\r\nhas taken it to heart rather.'\r\n\r\nRoscoe Sherriff pondered.\r\n\r\n'Is this worth half a column?' He shook his head. 'No, I'm afraid\r\nnot. The public doesn't know Pickering. If it had been Charlie\r\nChaplin or William J. Bryan, or someone on those lines, we could\r\nhave had the papers bringing out extras. You can visualize William\r\nJ. Bryan being bitten in the leg by a monkey. It hits you. But\r\nPickering! Eustace might just as well have bitten the leg of the\r\ntable!'\r\n\r\nLord Wetherby reasserted himself.\r\n\r\n'Now that the animal has become a public menace--'\r\n\r\n'He's nothing of the kind,' said Lady Wetherby. 'He's only a\r\nlittle upset to-day.'\r\n\r\n'Do you mean, Pauline, that even after this you will not get rid\r\nof him?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not--poor dear!'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Lord Wetherby, calmly. 'I give you warning that\r\nif he attacks me I shall defend myself.'\r\n\r\nHe brooded. Lady Wetherby turned to Claire.\r\n\r\n'What happened then? Did you shut the door of the garage?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but not until Eustace had got away. He slipped out like a\r\nstreak and disappeared. It was too dark to see which way he went.'\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering limped heavily into the room.\r\n\r\n'I was just telling them about you and Eustace, Dudley.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering nodded moodily. He was too full for words.\r\n\r\n'I think Eustace must be mad,' said Claire.\r\n\r\nRoscoe Sherriff uttered a cry of rapture.\r\n\r\n'You've said it!' he exclaimed. 'I knew we should get action\r\nsooner or later. It's the puma over again. Now we are all right.\r\nNow I have something to work on. \"Monkey Menaces Countryside.\"\r\n\"Long Island Summer Colony in Panic.\" \"Mad Monkey Bites One--\"'\r\n\r\nA convulsive shudder galvanized Mr Pickering's portly frame.\r\n\r\n'\"Mad Monkey Terrorizes Long Island. One Dead!\"' murmured Roscoe\r\nSherriff, wistfully. 'Do you feel a sort of shooting, Pickering--a\r\nkind of burning sensation under the skin? Lady Wetherby, I guess\r\nI'll be getting some of the papers on the phone. We've got a big\r\nstory.'\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the telephone, but it was some little time before he\r\ncould use it. Dudley Pickering was in possession, talking\r\nearnestly to the local doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Nutty Boyd's habit to retire immediately after dinner to\r\nhis bedroom. What he did there Elizabeth did not know. Sometimes\r\nshe pictured him reading, sometimes thinking. Neither supposition\r\nwas correct. Nutty never read. Newspapers bored him and books made\r\nhis head ache. And as for thinking, he had the wrong shape of\r\nforehead. The nearest he ever got to meditation was a sort of\r\ntrance-like state, a kind of suspended animation in which his mind\r\ndrifted sluggishly like a log in a backwater. Nutty, it is\r\nregrettable to say, went to his room after dinner for the purpose\r\nof imbibing two or three surreptitious whiskies-and-sodas.\r\n\r\nHe behaved in this way, he told himself, purely in order to spare\r\nElizabeth anxiety. There had been in the past a fool of a doctor\r\nwho had prescribed total abstinence for Nutty, and Elizabeth knew\r\nthis. Therefore, Nutty held, to take the mildest of drinks with\r\nher knowledge would have been to fill her with fears for his\r\nsafety. So he went to considerable inconvenience to keep the\r\nmatter from her notice, and thought rather highly of himself for\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was inconvenient--there was no doubt of that. It made\r\nhim feel like a cross between a hunted fawn and a burglar. But he\r\nhad to some extent diminished the possibility of surprise by\r\nleaving his door open; and to-night he approached the cupboard\r\nwhere he kept the materials for refreshment with a certain\r\nconfidence. He had left Elizabeth on the porch in a hammock,\r\napparently anchored for some time. Lord Dawlish was out in the\r\ngrounds somewhere. Presently he would come in and join Elizabeth\r\non the porch. The risk of interruption was negligible.\r\n\r\nNutty mixed himself a drink and settled down to brood bitterly, as\r\nhe often did, on the doctor who had made that disastrous\r\nstatement. Doctors were always saying things like that--sweeping\r\nthings which nervous people took too literally. It was true that\r\nhe had been in pretty bad shape at the moment when the words had\r\nbeen spoken. It was just at the end of his Broadway career, when,\r\nas he handsomely admitted, there was a certain amount of truth in\r\nthe opinion that his interior needed a vacation. But since then he\r\nhad been living in the country, breathing good air, taking things\r\neasy. In these altered conditions and after this lapse of time it\r\nwas absurd to imagine that a moderate amount of alcohol could do\r\nhim any harm.\r\n\r\nIt hadn't done him any harm, that was the point. He had tested the\r\ndoctor's statement and found it incorrect. He had spent three\r\nhectic days and nights in New York, and--after a reasonable\r\ninterval--had felt much the same as usual. And since then he had\r\nimbibed each night, and nothing had happened. What it came to was\r\nthat the doctor was a chump and a blighter. Simply that and\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\nHaving come to this decision, Nutty mixed another drink. He went\r\nto the head of the stairs and listened. He heard nothing. He\r\nreturned to his room.\r\n\r\nYes, that was it, the doctor was a chump. So far from doing him\r\nany harm, these nightly potations brightened Nutty up, gave him\r\nheart, and enabled him to endure life in this hole of a place. He\r\nfelt a certain scornful amusement. Doctors, he supposed, had to\r\nget off that sort of talk to earn their money.\r\n\r\nHe reached out for the bottle, and as he grasped it his eye was\r\ncaught by something on the floor. A brown monkey with a long, grey\r\ntail was sitting there staring at him.\r\n\r\nThere was one of those painful pauses. Nutty looked at the monkey\r\nrather like an elongated Macbeth inspecting the ghost of Banquo.\r\nThe monkey looked at Nutty. The pause continued. Nutty shut his\r\neyes, counted ten slowly, and opened them.\r\n\r\nThe monkey was still there.\r\n\r\n'Boo!' said Nutty, in an apprehensive undertone.\r\n\r\nThe monkey looked at him.\r\n\r\nNutty shut his eyes again. He would count sixty this time. A cold\r\nfear had laid its clammy fingers on his heart. This was what that\r\ndoctor--not such a chump after all--must have meant!\r\n\r\nNutty began to count. There seemed to be a heavy lump inside him,\r\nand his mouth was dry; but otherwise he felt all right. That was\r\nthe gruesome part of it--this dreadful thing had come upon him at\r\na moment when he could have sworn that he was sound as a bell. If\r\nthis had happened in the days when he ranged the Great White Way,\r\nsucking up deleterious moisture like a cloud, it would have been\r\nintelligible. But it had sneaked upon him like a thief in the\r\nnight; it had stolen unheralded into his life when he had\r\npractically reformed. What was the good of practically reforming\r\nif this sort of thing was going to happen to one?\r\n\r\n'... Fifty-nine ... sixty.'\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes. The monkey was still there, in precisely the\r\nsame attitude, as if it was sitting for its portrait. Panic surged\r\nupon Nutty. He lost his head completely. He uttered a wild yell\r\nand threw the bottle at the apparition.\r\n\r\nLife had not been treating Eustace well that evening. He seemed to\r\nhave happened upon one of those days when everything goes wrong.\r\nThe cat had scratched him, the odd-job man had swathed him in an\r\napron, and now this stranger, in whom he had found at first a\r\npleasant restfulness, soothing after the recent scenes of violence\r\nin which he had participated, did this to him. He dodged the\r\nmissile and clambered on to the top of the wardrobe. It was his\r\ninstinct in times of stress to seek the high spots. And then\r\nElizabeth hurried into the room.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had been lying in the hammock on the porch when her\r\nbrother's yell had broken forth. It was a lovely, calm, moonlight\r\nnight, and she had been revelling in the peace of it, when\r\nsuddenly this outcry from above had shot her out of her hammock\r\nlike an explosion. She ran upstairs, fearing she knew not what.\r\nShe found Nutty sitting on the bed, looking like an overwrought\r\ngiraffe.\r\n\r\n'Whatever is the--?' she began; and then things began to impress\r\nthemselves on her senses.\r\n\r\nThe bottle which Nutty had thrown at Eustace had missed the\r\nlatter, but it had hit the wall, and was now lying in many pieces\r\non the floor, and the air was heavy with the scent of it. The\r\nremains seemed to leer at her with a kind of furtive swagger,\r\nafter the manner of broken bottles. A quick thrill of anger ran\r\nthrough Elizabeth. She had always felt more like a mother to Nutty\r\nthan a sister, and now she would have liked to exercise the\r\nmaternal privilege of slapping him.\r\n\r\n'Nutty!'\r\n\r\n'I saw a monkey!' said her brother, hollowly. 'I was standing over\r\nthere and I saw a monkey! Of course, it wasn't there really. I\r\nflung the bottle at it, and it seemed to climb on to that\r\nwardrobe.'\r\n\r\n'This wardrobe?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth struck it a resounding blow with the palm of her hand,\r\nand Eustace's face popped over the edge, peering down anxiously.\r\n'I can see it now,' said Nutty. A sudden, faint hope came to him.\r\n'Can you see it?' he asked.\r\n\r\nElizabeth did not speak for a moment. This was an unusual\r\nsituation, and she was wondering how to treat it. She was sorry\r\nfor Nutty, but Providence had sent this thing and it would be\r\nfoolish to reject it. She must look on herself in the light of a\r\ndoctor. It would be kinder to Nutty in the end. She had the\r\nfeminine aversion from the lie deliberate. Her ethics on the\r\n_suggestio falsi_ were weak. She looked at Nutty questioningly.\r\n\r\n'See it?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Don't you see a monkey on the top of the wardrobe?' said Nutty,\r\nbecoming more definite.\r\n\r\n'There's a sort of bit of wood sticking out--'\r\n\r\nNutty sighed.\r\n\r\n'No, not that. You didn't see it. I don't think you would.'\r\n\r\nHe spoke so dejectedly that for a moment Elizabeth weakened, but\r\nonly for an instant.\r\n\r\n'Tell me all about this, Nutty,' she said.\r\n\r\nNutty was beyond the desire for evasion and concealment. His one\r\nwish was to tell. He told all.\r\n\r\n'But, Nutty, how silly of you!'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'After what the doctor said.'\r\n\r\n'I know.'\r\n\r\n'You remember his telling you--'\r\n\r\n'I know. Never again!'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I quit. I'm going to give it up.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth embraced him maternally.\r\n\r\n'That's a good child!' she said. 'You really promise?'\r\n\r\n'I don't have to promise, I'm just going to do it.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth compromised with her conscience by becoming soothing.\r\n\r\n'You know, this isn't so very serious, Nutty, darling. I mean,\r\nit's just a warning.'\r\n\r\n'It's warned me all right.'\r\n\r\n'You will be perfectly all right if--'\r\n\r\nNutty interrupted her.\r\n\r\n'You're sure you can't see anything?'\r\n\r\n'See what?'\r\n\r\nNutty's voice became almost apologetic.\r\n\r\n'I know it's just imagination, but the monkey seems to me to be\r\nclimbing down from the wardrobe.'\r\n\r\n'I can't see anything climbing down the wardrobe,' said Elizabeth,\r\nas Eustace touched the floor.\r\n\r\n'It's come down now. It's crossing the carpet.'\r\n\r\n'Where?'\r\n\r\n'It's gone now. It went out of the door.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!'\r\n\r\n'I say, Elizabeth, what do you think I ought to do?'\r\n\r\n'I should go to bed and have a nice long sleep, and you'll feel--'\r\n\r\n'Somehow I don't feel much like going to bed. This sort of thing\r\nupsets a chap, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Poor dear!'\r\n\r\n'I think I'll go for a long walk.'\r\n\r\n'That's a splendid idea.'\r\n\r\n'I think I'd better do a good lot of walking from now on. Didn't\r\nChalmers bring down some Indian clubs with him? I think I'll\r\nborrow them. I ought to keep out in the open a lot, I think. I\r\nwonder if there's any special diet I ought to have. Well, anyway,\r\nI'll be going for that walk.'\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stairs Nutty stopped. He looked quickly into\r\nthe porch, then looked away again.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?' asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n'I thought for a moment I saw the monkey sitting on the hammock.'\r\n\r\nHe went out of the house and disappeared from view down the drive,\r\nwalking with long, rapid strides.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's first act, when he had gone, was to fetch a banana\r\nfrom the ice-box. Her knowledge of monkeys was slight, but she\r\nfancied they looked with favour on bananas. It was her intention\r\nto conciliate Eustace.\r\n\r\nShe had placed Eustace by now. Unlike Nutty, she read the papers,\r\nand she knew all about Lady Wetherby and her pets. The fact that\r\nLady Wetherby, as she had been informed by the grocer in friendly\r\ntalk, had rented a summer house in the neighbourhood made\r\nEustace's identity positive.\r\n\r\nShe had no very clear plans as to what she intended to do with\r\nEustace, beyond being quite resolved that she was going to board\r\nand lodge him for a few days. Nutty had had the jolt he needed,\r\nbut it might be that the first freshness of it would wear away, in\r\nwhich event it would be convenient to have Eustace on the\r\npremises. She regarded Eustace as a sort of medicine. A second\r\ndose might not be necessary, but it was as well to have the\r\nmixture handy. She took another banana, in case the first might\r\nnot be sufficient. She then returned to the porch.\r\n\r\nEustace was sitting on the hammock, brooding. The complexities of\r\nlife were weighing him down a good deal. He was not aware of\r\nElizabeth's presence until he found her standing by him. He had\r\njust braced himself for flight, when he perceived that she bore\r\nrich gifts.\r\n\r\nEustace was always ready for a light snack--readier now than\r\nusual, for air and exercise had sharpened his appetite. He took\r\nthe banana in a detached manner, as it to convey the idea that it\r\ndid not commit him to any particular course of conduct. It was a\r\ngood banana, and he stretched out a hand for the other. Elizabeth\r\nsat down beside him, but he did not move. He was convinced now of\r\nher good intentions. It was thus that Lord Dawlish found them when\r\nhe came in from the garden.\r\n\r\n'Where has your brother gone to?' he asked. 'He passed me just now\r\nat eight miles an hour. Great Scot! What's that?'\r\n\r\n'It's a monkey. Don't frighten him; he's rather nervous.'\r\n\r\nShe tickled Eustace under the ear, for their relations were now\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\n'Nutty went for a walk because he thought he saw it.'\r\n\r\n'Thought he saw it?'\r\n\r\n'Thought he saw it,' repeated Elizabeth, firmly. 'Will you\r\nremember, Mr Chalmers, that, as far as he is concerned, this\r\nmonkey has no existence?'\r\n\r\n'I don't understand.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth explained.\r\n\r\n'You see now?'\r\n\r\n'I see. But how long are you going to keep the animal?'\r\n\r\n'Just a day or two--in case.'\r\n\r\n'Where are you going to keep it?'\r\n\r\n'In the outhouse. Nutty never goes there, it's too near the\r\nbee-hives.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you don't know who the owner is?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I do; it must be Lady Wetherby.'\r\n\r\n'Lady Wetherby!'\r\n\r\n'She's a woman who dances at one of the restaurants. I read in a\r\nSunday paper about her monkey. She has just taken a house near\r\nhere. I don't see who else the animal could belong to. Monkeys are\r\nrarities on Long Island.'\r\n\r\nBill was silent. 'Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,\r\nflushing his brow.' For days he had been trying to find an excuse\r\nfor calling on Lady Wetherby as a first step toward meeting Claire\r\nagain. Here it was. There would be no need to interfere with\r\nElizabeth's plans. He would be vague. He would say he had just\r\nseen the runaway, but would not add where. He would create an\r\natmosphere of helpful sympathy. Perhaps, later on, Elizabeth would\r\nlet him take the monkey back.\r\n\r\n'What are you thinking about?' asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n'Oh, nothing,' said Bill.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps we had better stow away our visitor for the night.'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth got up.\r\n\r\n'Poor, dear Nutty may be coming back at any moment now,' she said.\r\n\r\nBut poor, dear Nutty did not return for a full two hours. When he\r\ndid he was dusty and tired, but almost cheerful.\r\n\r\n'I didn't see the brute once all the time I was out,' he told\r\nElizabeth. 'Not once!'\r\n\r\nElizabeth kissed him fondly and offered to heat water for a bath;\r\nbut Nutty said he would take it cold. From now on, he vowed,\r\nnothing but cold baths. He conveyed the impression of being a\r\nblend of repentant sinner and hardy Norseman. Before he went to\r\nbed he approached Bill on the subject of Indian clubs.\r\n\r\n'I want to get myself into shape, old top,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'I've got to cut it out--to-night I thought I saw a monkey.'\r\n\r\n'Really?'\r\n\r\n'As plain as I see you now.' Nutty gave the clubs a tentative\r\nswing. 'What do you do with these darned things? Swing them about\r\nand all that? All right, I see the idea. Good night.'\r\n\r\nBut Bill did not pass a good night. He lay awake long, thinking\r\nover his plans for the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby was feeling battered. She had not realized how\r\nseriously Roscoe Sherriff took the art of publicity, nor what\r\nwould be the result of the half-hour he had spent at the telephone\r\non the night of the departure of Eustace.\r\n\r\nRoscoe Sherriff's eloquence had fired the imagination of editors.\r\nThere had been a notable lack of interesting happenings this\r\nsummer. Nobody seemed to be striking or murdering or having\r\nviolent accidents. The universe was torpid. In these circumstances,\r\nthe escape of Eustace seemed to present possibilities. Reporters\r\nhad been sent down. There were three of them living in the house\r\nnow, and Wrench's air of disapproval was deepening every hour.\r\n\r\nIt was their strenuousness which had given Lady Wetherby that\r\nbattered feeling. There was strenuousness in the air, and she\r\nresented it on her vacation. She had come to Long Island to\r\nvegetate, and with all this going on round her vegetation was\r\nimpossible. She was not long alone. Wrench entered.\r\n\r\n'A gentleman to see you, m'lady.'\r\n\r\nIn the good old days, when she had been plain Polly Davis, of the\r\npersonnel of the chorus of various musical comedies, Lady Wetherby\r\nwould have suggested a short way of disposing of this untimely\r\nvisitor; but she had a position to keep up now.\r\n\r\n'From some darned paper?' she asked, wearily.\r\n\r\n'No, m'lady. I fancy he is not connected with the Press.'\r\n\r\nThere was something in Wrench's manner that perplexed Lady\r\nWetherby, something almost human, as if Wrench were on the point\r\nof coming alive. She did not guess it, but the explanation was\r\nthat Bill, quite unwittingly, had impressed Wrench. There was that\r\nabout Bill that reminded the butler of London and dignified\r\nreceptions at the house of the Dowager Duchess of Waveney. It was\r\ndeep calling unto deep.\r\n\r\n'Where is he?'\r\n\r\n'I have shown him into the drawing-room, m'lady.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby went downstairs and found a large young man awaiting\r\nher, looking nervous.\r\n\r\nBill was feeling nervous. A sense of the ridiculousness of his\r\nmission had come upon him. After all, he asked himself, what on\r\nearth had he got to say? A presentiment had come upon him that he\r\nwas about to look a perfect ass. At the sight of Lady Wetherby his\r\nnervousness began to diminish. Lady Wetherby was not a formidable\r\nperson. In spite of her momentary peevishness, she brought with\r\nher an atmosphere of geniality and camaraderie.\r\n\r\n'It's about your monkey,' he said, coming to the point at once.\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby brightened.\r\n\r\n'Oh! Have you seen it?'\r\n\r\nHe was glad that she put it like that.\r\n\r\n'Yes. It came round our way last night.'\r\n\r\n'Where is that?'\r\n\r\n'I am staying at a farm near here, a place they call Flack's. The\r\nmonkey got into one of the rooms.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'And then--er--then it got out again, don't you know.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby looked disappointed.\r\n\r\n'So it may be anywhere now?' she said.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of truth, Bill thought it best to leave this\r\nquestion unanswered.\r\n\r\n'Well, it's very good of you to have bothered to come out and tell\r\nme,' said Lady Wetherby. 'It gives us a clue, at any rate. Thank\r\nyou. At least, we know now in which direction it went.'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Bill gathered that the other was looking on the\r\ninterview as terminated, and that she was expecting him to go, and\r\nhe had not begun to say what he wanted to say. He tried to think\r\nof a way of introducing the subject of Claire that should not seem\r\ntoo abrupt.\r\n\r\n'Er--' he said.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Lady Wetherby, simultaneously.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon.'\r\n\r\n'You have the floor,' said Lady Wetherby. 'Shoot!'\r\n\r\nIt was not what she had intended to say. For months she had been\r\ntrying to get out of the habit of saying that sort of thing, but\r\nshe still suffered relapses. Only the other day she had told\r\nWrench to check some domestic problem or other with his hat, and\r\nhe had nearly given notice. But if she had been intending to put\r\nBill at his ease she could not have said anything better.\r\n\r\n'You have a Miss Fenwick staying with you, haven't you?' he said.\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby beamed.\r\n\r\n'Do you know Claire?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, rather!'\r\n\r\n'She's my best friend. We used to be in the same company when I\r\nwas in England.'\r\n\r\n'So she has told me.'\r\n\r\n'She was my bridesmaid when I married Lord Wetherby.'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby was feeling perfectly happy now, and when Lady\r\nWetherby felt happy she always became garrulous. She was one of\r\nthose people who are incapable of looking on anybody as a stranger\r\nafter five minutes' acquaintance. Already she had begun to regard\r\nBill as an old friend.\r\n\r\n'Those were great days,' she said, cheerfully. 'None of us had a\r\nbean, and Algie was the hardest up of the whole bunch. After we\r\nwere married we went to the Savoy for the wedding-breakfast, and\r\nwhen it was over and the waiter came with the check, Algie said he\r\nwas sorry, but he had had a bad week at Lincoln and hadn't the\r\nprice on him. He tried to touch me, but I passed. Then he had a go\r\nat the best man, but the best man had nothing in the world but one\r\nsuit of clothes and a spare collar. Claire was broke, too, so the\r\nend of it was that the best man had to sneak out and pawn my watch\r\nand the wedding-ring.'\r\n\r\nThe room rang with her reminiscent laughter, Bill supplying a bass\r\naccompaniment. Bill was delighted. He had never hoped that it\r\nwould be granted to him to become so rapidly intimate with\r\nClaire's hostess. Why, he had only to keep the conversation in\r\nthis chummy vein for a little while longer and she would give him\r\nthe run of the house.\r\n\r\n'Miss Fenwick isn't in now, I suppose?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'No, Claire's out with Dudley Pickering. You don't know him, do\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'She's engaged to him.'\r\n\r\nIt is an ironical fact that Lady Wetherby was by nature one of the\r\nfirmest believers in existence in the policy of breaking things\r\ngently to people. She had a big, soft heart, and she hated hurting\r\nher fellows. As a rule, when she had bad news to impart to any one\r\nshe administered the blow so gradually and with such mystery as to\r\nthe actual facts that the victim, having passed through the\r\nvarious stages of imagined horrors, was genuinely relieved, when\r\nshe actually came to the point, to find that all that had happened\r\nwas that he had lost all his money. But now in perfect innocence,\r\nthinking only to pass along an interesting bit of information, she\r\nhad crushed Bill as effectively as if she had used a club for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n'I'm tickled to death about it,' she went on, as it were over her\r\nhearer's prostrate body. It was I who brought them together, you\r\nknow. I wrote telling Claire to come out here on the _Atlantic,_\r\nknowing that Dudley was sailing on that boat. I had an idea they\r\nwould hit it off together. Dudley fell for her right away, and she\r\nmust have fallen for him, for they had only known each other\r\nfor a few weeks when they came and told me they were engaged.\r\nIt happened last Sunday.'\r\n\r\n'Last Sunday!'\r\n\r\nIt had seemed to Bill a moment before that he would never again be\r\ncapable of speech, but this statement dragged the words out of\r\nhim. Last Sunday! Why, it was last Sunday that Claire had broken\r\noff her engagement with him!\r\n\r\n'Last Sunday at nine o'clock in the evening, with a full moon\r\nshining and soft music going on off-stage. Real third-act stuff.'\r\n\r\nBill felt positively dizzy. He groped back in his memory for\r\nfacts. He had gone out for his walk after dinner. They had dined\r\nat eight. He had been walking some time. Why, in Heaven's name,\r\nthis was the quickest thing in the amatory annals of civilization!\r\nHis brain was too numbed to work out a perfectly accurate\r\nschedule, but it looked as if she must have got engaged to this\r\nPickering person before she met him, Bill, in the road that night.\r\n\r\n'It's a wonderful match for dear old Claire,' resumed Lady\r\nWetherby, twisting the knife in the wound with a happy unconsciousness.\r\n'Dudley's not only a corking good fellow, but he has thirty million\r\ndollars stuffed away in the stocking and a business that brings him\r\nin a perfectly awful mess of money every year. He's the Pickering of\r\nthe Pickering automobiles, you know.'\r\n\r\nBill got up. He stood for a moment holding to the back of his\r\nchair before speaking. It was almost exactly thus that he had felt\r\nin the days when he had gone in for boxing and had stopped\r\nforceful swings with the more sensitive portions of his person.\r\n\r\n'That--that's splendid!' he said. 'I--I think I'll be going.'\r\n\r\n'I heard the car outside just now,' said Lady Wetherby. 'I think\r\nit's probably Claire and Dudley come back. Won't you wait and see\r\nher?'\r\n\r\nBill shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Well, good-bye for the present, then. You must come round again.\r\nAny friend of Claire's--and it was bully of you to bother about\r\nlooking in to tell of Eustace.'\r\n\r\nBill had reached the door. He was about to turn the handle when\r\nsomeone turned it on the other side.\r\n\r\n'Why, here is Dudley,' said Lady Wetherby. 'Dudley, this is a\r\nfriend of Claire's.'\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering was one of those men who take the ceremony of\r\nintroduction with a measured solemnity. It was his practice to\r\ngrasp the party of the second part firmly by the hand, hold it,\r\nlook into his eyes in a reverent manner, and get off some little\r\nspeech of appreciation, short but full of feeling. The opening\r\npart of this ceremony he performed now. He grasped Bill's hand\r\nfirmly, held it, and looked into his eyes. And then, having\r\nperformed his business, he fell down on his lines. Not a word\r\nproceeded from him. He dropped the hand and stared at Bill\r\namazedly and--more than that--with fear.\r\n\r\nBill, too, uttered no word. It was not one of those chatty\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nBut if they were short on words, both Bill and Mr Pickering were\r\nlong on looks. Bill stared at Mr Pickering. Mr Pickering stared at\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nBill was drinking in Mr Pickering. The stoutness of Mr Pickering--the\r\norderliness of Mr Pickering--the dullness of Mr Pickering--all these\r\nthings he perceived. And illumination broke upon him.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering was drinking in Bill. The largeness of Bill--the\r\nembarrassment of Bill--the obvious villainy of Bill--none of these\r\nthings escaped his notice. And illumination broke upon him also.\r\n\r\nFor Dudley Pickering, in the first moment of their meeting, had\r\nrecognized Bill as the man who had been lurking in the grounds and\r\npeering in at the window, the man at whom on the night when he had\r\nbecome engaged to Claire he had shouted 'Hi!'\r\n\r\n'Where's Claire, Dudley?' asked Lady Wetherby.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering withdrew his gaze reluctantly from Bill.\r\n\r\n'Gone upstairs.'\r\n\r\nI'll go and tell her that you're here, Mr--You never told me your\r\nname.'\r\n\r\nBill came to life with an almost acrobatic abruptness. There were\r\nmany things of which at that moment he felt absolutely incapable,\r\nand meeting Claire was one of them.\r\n\r\n'No; I must be going,' he said, hurriedly. 'Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nHe came very near running out of the room. Lady Wetherby regarded\r\nthe practically slammed door with wide eyes.\r\n\r\n'Quick exit of Nut Comedian!' she said. 'Whatever was the matter\r\nwith the man? He's scorched a trail in the carpet.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering was trembling violently.\r\n\r\n'Do you know who that was? He was the man!' said Mr Pickering.\r\n\r\n'What man?'\r\n\r\n'The man I caught looking in at the window that night!'\r\n\r\n'What nonsense! You must be mistaken. He said he knew Claire quite\r\nwell.'\r\n\r\n'But when you suggested that he should meet her he ran.'\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the matter had not occurred to Lady Wetherby.\r\n\r\n'So he did!'\r\n\r\n'What did he tell you that showed he knew Claire?'\r\n\r\n'Well, now that I come to think of it, he didn't tell me anything.\r\nI did the talking. He just sat there.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering quivered with combined fear and excitement and\r\ninductive reasoning.\r\n\r\n'It was a trick!' he cried. 'Remember what Sherriff said that\r\nnight when I told you about finding the man looking in at the\r\nwindow? He said that the fellow was spying round as a preliminary\r\nmove. To-day he trumps up an obviously false excuse for getting\r\ninto the house. Was he left alone in the rooms at all?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Wrench loosed him in here and then came up to tell me.'\r\n\r\n'For several minutes, then, he was alone in the house. Why, he had\r\ntime to do all he wanted to do!'\r\n\r\n'Calm down!'\r\n\r\n'I am perfectly calm. But--'\r\n\r\n'You've been seeing too many crook plays, Dudley. A man isn't\r\nnecessarily a burglar because he wears a decent suit of clothes.'\r\n\r\n'Why was he lurking in the grounds that night?'\r\n\r\n'You're just imagining that it was the same man.'\r\n\r\n'I am absolutely positive it was the same man.'\r\n\r\n'Well, we can easily settle one thing about him, at any rate. Here\r\ncomes Claire. Claire, old girl,' she said, as the door opened, 'do\r\nyou know a man named--Darn it! I never got his name, but he's--'\r\n\r\nClaire stood in the doorway, looking from one to the other.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter, Dudley?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Dudley's gone clean up in the air,' explained Lady Wetherby,\r\ntolerantly. 'A friend of yours called to tell me he had seen\r\nEustace--'\r\n\r\n'So that was his excuse, was it?' said Dudley Pickering. 'Did he\r\nsay where Eustace was?'\r\n\r\n'No; he said he had seen him; that was all.'\r\n\r\n'An obviously trumped-up story. He had heard of Eustace's escape\r\nand he knew that any story connected with him would be a passport\r\ninto the house.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby turned to Claire.\r\n\r\n'You haven't told us yet if you know the man. He was a big, tall,\r\nbroad gazook,' said Lady Wetherby. 'Very English.'\r\n\r\n'He faked the English,' said Dudley Pickering. 'That man was no\r\nmore an Englishman than I am.'\r\n\r\n'Be patient with him, Claire,' urged Lady Wetherby. 'He's been\r\ngoing to the movies too much, and thinks every man who has had his\r\ntrousers pressed is a social gangster. This man was the most\r\nEnglish thing I've ever seen--talked like this.'\r\n\r\nShe gave a passable reproduction of Bill's speech. Claire started.\r\n\r\n'I don't know him!' she cried.\r\n\r\nHer mind was in a whirl of agitation. Why had Bill come to the\r\nhouse? What had he said? Had he told Dudley anything?\r\n\r\n'I don't recognize the description,' she said, quickly. 'I don't\r\nknow anything about him.'\r\n\r\n'There!' said Dudley Pickering, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n'It's queer,' said Lady Wetherby. 'You're sure you don't know him,\r\nClaire?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely sure.'\r\n\r\n'He said he was living at a place near here, called Flack's.'\r\n\r\n'I know the place,' said Dudley Pickering. 'A sinister, tumbledown\r\nsort of place. Just where a bunch of crooks would be living.'\r\n\r\n'I thought it was a bee-farm,' said Lady Wetherby. 'One of the\r\ntradesmen told me about it. I saw a most corkingly pretty girl\r\nbicycling down to the village one morning, and they told me she\r\nwas named Boyd and kept a bee-farm at Flack's.'\r\n\r\n'A blind!' said Mr Pickering, stoutly. 'The girl's the man's\r\naccomplice. It's quite easy to see the way they work. The girl\r\ncomes and settles in the place so that everybody knows her. That's\r\nto lull suspicion. Then the man comes down for a visit and goes\r\nabout cleaning up the neighbouring houses. You can't get away from\r\nthe fact that this summer there have been half a dozen burglaries\r\ndown here, and nobody has found out who did them.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby looked at him indulgently.\r\n\r\n'And now,' she said, 'having got us scared stiff, what are you\r\ngoing to do about it?'\r\n\r\n'I am going,' he said, with determination, 'to take steps.'\r\n\r\nHe went out quickly, the keen, tense man of affairs.\r\n\r\n'Bless him!' said Lady Wetherby. 'I'd no idea your Dudley had so\r\nmuch imagination, Claire. He's a perfect bomb-shell.'\r\n\r\nClaire laughed shakily.\r\n\r\n'It is odd, though,' said Lady Wetherby, meditatively, 'that this\r\nman should have said that he knew you, when you don't--'\r\n\r\nClaire turned impulsively.\r\n\r\n'Polly, I want to tell you something. Promise you won't tell\r\nDudley. I wasn't telling the truth just now. I do know this man. I\r\nwas engaged to him once.'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'For goodness' sake don't tell Dudley!'\r\n\r\n'But--'\r\n\r\n'It's all over now; but I used to be engaged to him.'\r\n\r\n'Not when I was in England?'\r\n\r\n'No, after that.'\r\n\r\n'Then he didn't know you are engaged to Dudley now?'\r\n\r\n'N-no. I--I haven't seen him for a long time.'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby looked remorseful.\r\n\r\n'Poor man! I must have given him a jolt! But why didn't you tell\r\nme about him before?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, I'm not inquisitive. There's no rubber in my\r\ncomposition. It's your affair.'\r\n\r\n'You won't tell Dudley?'\r\n\r\n'Of course not. But why not? You've nothing to be ashamed of.'\r\n\r\n'No; but--'\r\n\r\n'Well, I won't tell him, anyway. But I'm glad you told me about\r\nhim. Dudley was so eloquent about burglars that he almost had me\r\ngoing. I wonder where he rushed off to?'\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering had rushed off to his bedroom, and was examining\r\na revolver there. He examined it carefully, keenly. Preparedness\r\nwas Dudley Pickering's slogan. He looked rather like a stout\r\nsheriff in a film drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interesting land of India, where snakes abound and\r\nscorpions are common objects of the wayside, a native who has had\r\nthe misfortune to be bitten by one of the latter pursues an\r\nadmirably common-sense plan. He does not stop to lament, nor does\r\nhe hang about analysing his emotions. He runs and runs and runs,\r\nand keeps on running until he has worked the poison out of his\r\nsystem. Not until then does he attempt introspection.\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish, though ignorant of this fact, pursued almost\r\nidentically the same policy. He did not run on leaving Lady\r\nWetherby's house, but he took a very long and very rapid walk,\r\nthan which in times of stress there are few things of greater\r\nmedicinal value to the human mind. To increase the similarity, he\r\nwas conscious of a curious sense of being poisoned. He felt\r\nstifled--in want of air.\r\n\r\nBill was a simple young man, and he had a simple code of ethics.\r\nAbove all things he prized and admired and demanded from his\r\nfriends the quality of straightness. It was his one demand. He had\r\nnever actually had a criminal friend, but he was quite capable of\r\nintimacy with even a criminal, provided only that there was\r\nsomething spacious about his brand of crime and that it did not\r\ninvolve anything mean or underhand. It was the fact that Mr\r\nBreitstein whom Claire had wished him to insinuate into his club,\r\nthough acquitted of actual crime, had been proved guilty of\r\nmeanness and treachery, that had so prejudiced Bill against him.\r\nThe worst accusation that he could bring against a man was that he\r\nwas not square, that he had not played the game.\r\n\r\nClaire had not been square. It was that, more than the shock of\r\nsurprise of Lady Wetherby's news, that had sent him striding along\r\nthe State Road at the rate of five miles an hour, staring before\r\nhim with unseeing eyes. A sudden recollection of their last\r\ninterview brought a dull flush to Bill's face and accelerated his\r\nspeed. He felt physically ill.\r\n\r\nIt was not immediately that he had arrived at even this sketchy\r\noutline of his feelings. For perhaps a mile he walked as the\r\nscorpion-stung natives run--blindly, wildly, with nothing in his\r\nmind but a desire to walk faster and faster, to walk as no man had\r\never walked before. And then--one does not wish to be unduly\r\nrealistic, but the fact is too important to be ignored--he began\r\nto perspire. And hard upon that unrefined but wonder-working flow\r\ncame a certain healing of spirit. Dimly at first but every moment\r\nmore clearly, he found it possible to think.\r\n\r\nIn a man of Bill's temperament there are so many qualities wounded\r\nby a blow such as he had received, that it is hardly surprising\r\nthat his emotions, when he began to examine them, were mixed. Now\r\none, now another, of his wounds presented itself to his notice.\r\nAnd then individual wounds would become difficult to distinguish\r\nin the mass of injuries. Spiritually, he was in the position of a\r\nman who has been hit simultaneously in a number of sensitive spots\r\nby a variety of hard and hurtful things. He was as little able,\r\nduring the early stages of his meditations, to say where he was\r\nhurt most as a man who had been stabbed in the back, bitten in the\r\nankle, hit in the eye, smitten with a blackjack, and kicked on the\r\nshin in the same moment of time. All that such a man would be able\r\nto say with certainty would be that unpleasant things had happened\r\nto him; and that was all that Bill was able to say.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, walking swiftly the while, he began to make a\r\nrough inventory. He sorted out his injuries, catalogued them. It\r\nwas perhaps his self-esteem that had suffered least of all, for he\r\nwas by nature modest. He had a savage humility, valuable in a\r\ncrisis of this sort.\r\n\r\nBut he looked up to Claire. He had thought her straight. And all\r\nthe time that she had been saying those things to him that night\r\nof their last meeting she had been engaged to another man, a fat,\r\nbald, doddering, senile fool, whose only merit was his money.\r\nScarcely a fair description of Mr Pickering, but in a man in\r\nBill's position a little bias is excusable.\r\n\r\nBill walked on. He felt as if he could walk for ever. Automobiles\r\nwhirred past, hooting peevishly, but he heeded them not. Dogs\r\ntrotted out to exchange civilities, but he ignored them. The\r\npoison in his blood drove him on.\r\n\r\nAnd then quite suddenly and unexpectedly the fever passed. Almost\r\nin mid-stride he became another man, a healed, sane man, keenly\r\naware of a very vivid thirst and a desire to sit down and rest\r\nbefore attempting the ten miles of cement road that lay between\r\nhim and home. Half an hour at a wayside inn completed the cure. It\r\nwas a weary but clear-headed Bill who trudged back through the\r\ngathering dusk.\r\n\r\nHe found himself thinking of Claire as of someone he had known\r\nlong ago, someone who had never touched his life. She seemed so\r\nfar away that he wondered how she could ever have affected him for\r\npain or pleasure. He looked at her across a chasm. This is the\r\nreal difference between love and infatuation, that infatuation\r\ncan be slain cleanly with a single blow. In the hour of clear\r\nvision which had come to him, Bill saw that he had never loved\r\nClaire. It was her beauty that had held him, that and the appeal\r\nwhich her circumstances had made to his pity. Their minds had not\r\nrun smoothly together. Always there had been something that\r\njarred, a subtle antagonism. And she was crooked.\r\n\r\nAlmost unconsciously his mind began to build up an image of the\r\nideal girl, the girl he would have liked Claire to be, the girl\r\nwho would conform to all that he demanded of woman. She would be\r\nbrave. He realized now that, even though it had moved his pity,\r\nClaire's querulousness had offended something in him.\r\n\r\nHe had made allowances for her, but the ideal girl would have had\r\nno need of allowances. The ideal girl would be plucky, cheerfully\r\nvaliant, a fighter. She would not admit the existence of hard\r\nluck.\r\n\r\nShe would be honest. Here, too, she would have no need of allowances.\r\nNo temptation would be strong enough to make her do a mean act or\r\nthink a mean thought, for her courage would give her strength, and\r\nher strength would make her proof against temptation. She would be\r\nkind. That was because she would also be extremely intelligent,\r\nand, being extremely intelligent, would have need of kindness to\r\nenable her to bear with a not very intelligent man like himself.\r\nFor the rest, she would be small and alert and pretty, and fair\r\nhaired--and brown-eyed--and she would keep a bee farm and her name\r\nwould be Elizabeth Boyd.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived with a sense of mild astonishment at this\r\nconclusion, Bill found, also to his surprise, that he had walked\r\nten miles without knowing it and that he was turning in at the\r\nfarm gate. Somebody came down the drive, and he saw that it was\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nShe hurried to meet him, small and shadowy in the uncertain light.\r\nJames, the cat, stalked rheumatically at her side. She came up to\r\nBill, and he saw that her face wore an anxious look. He gazed at\r\nher with a curious feeling that it was a very long time since he\r\nhad seen her last.\r\n\r\n'Where have you been?' she said, her voice troubled. 'I couldn't\r\nthink what had become of you.'\r\n\r\n'I went for a walk.'\r\n\r\n'But you've been gone hours and hours.'\r\n\r\n'I went to a place called Morrisville.'\r\n\r\n'Morrisville!' Elizabeth's eyes opened wide. 'Have you walked\r\ntwenty miles?'\r\n\r\n'Why, I--I believe I have.'\r\n\r\nIt was the first time he had been really conscious of it.\r\nElizabeth looked at him in consternation. Perhaps it was the\r\nassociation in her mind of unexpected walks with the newly-born\r\nactivities of the repentant Nutty that gave her the feeling that\r\nthere must be some mental upheaval on a large scale at the back of\r\nthis sudden ebullition of long-distance pedestrianism. She\r\nremembered that the thought had come to her once or twice during\r\nthe past week that all was not well with her visitor, and that he\r\nhad seemed downcast and out of spirits.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\n'Is anything the matter, Mr Chalmers?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Bill, decidedly. He would have found a difficulty in\r\nmaking that answer with any ring of conviction earlier in the day,\r\nbut now it was different. There was nothing whatever the matter\r\nwith him now. He had never felt happier.\r\n\r\n'You're sure?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely. I feel fine.'\r\n\r\n'I thought--I've been thinking for some days--that you might be in\r\ntrouble of some sort.'\r\n\r\nBill swiftly added another to that list of qualities which he had\r\nbeen framing on his homeward journey. That girl of his would be\r\nangelically sympathetic.\r\n\r\n'It's awfully good of you,' he said, 'but honestly I feel like--I\r\nfeel great.'\r\n\r\nThe little troubled look passed from Elizabeth's face. Her eyes\r\ntwinkled.\r\n\r\n'You're really feeling happy?'\r\n\r\n'Tremendously.'\r\n\r\n'Then let me damp you. We're in an awful fix!'\r\n\r\n'What! In what way?'\r\n\r\n'About the monkey.'\r\n\r\n'Has he escaped?'\r\n\r\n'That's the trouble--he hasn't.'\r\n\r\n'I don't understand.'\r\n\r\n'Come and sit down and I'll tell you. It's a shame to keep you\r\nstanding after your walk.'\r\n\r\nThey made their way to the massive stone seat which Mr Flack, the\r\nlandlord, had bought at a sale and dumped in a moment of\r\nexuberance on the farm grounds.\r\n\r\n'This is the most hideous thing on earth,' said Elizabeth\r\ncasually, 'but it will do to sit on. Now tell me: why did you go\r\nto Lady Wetherby's this afternoon?'\r\n\r\nIt was all so remote, it seemed so long ago that he had wanted to\r\nfind an excuse for meeting Claire again, that for a moment Bill\r\nhesitated in actual perplexity, and before he could speak Elizabeth\r\nhad answered the question for him.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you went out of kindness of heart to relieve the poor\r\nlady's mind,' she said. 'But you certainly did the wrong thing.\r\nYou started something!'\r\n\r\n'I didn't tell her the animal was here.'\r\n\r\n'What did you tell her?'\r\n\r\n'I said I had seen it, don't you know.'\r\n\r\n'That was enough.'\r\n\r\n'I'm awfully sorry.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, we shall pull through all right, but we must act at once. We\r\nmust be swift and resolute. We must saddle our chargers and up and\r\naway, and all that sort of thing. Show a flash of speed,' she\r\nexplained kindly, at the sight of Bill's bewildered face.\r\n\r\n'But what has happened?'\r\n\r\n'The press is on our trail. I've been interviewing reporters all\r\nthe afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'Reporters!'\r\n\r\n'Millions of them. The place is alive with them. Keen, hatchet-faced\r\nyoung men, and every one of them was the man who really unravelled\r\nsome murder mystery or other, though the police got the credit for\r\nit. They told me so.'\r\n\r\n'But, I say, how on earth--'\r\n\r\n'--did they get here? I suppose Lady Wetherby invited them.'\r\n\r\n'But why?'\r\n\r\n'She wants the advertisement, of course. I know it doesn't sound\r\nsensational--a lost monkey; but when it's a celebrity's lost\r\nmonkey it makes a difference. Suppose King George had lost a\r\nmonkey; wouldn't your London newspapers give it a good deal of\r\nspace? Especially if it had thrown eggs at one of the ladies and\r\nbitten the Duke of Norfolk in the leg? That's what our visitor has\r\nbeen doing apparently. At least, he threw eggs at the scullery-maid\r\nand bit a millionaire. It's practically the same thing. At any\r\nrate, there it is. The newspaper men are here, and they seem\r\nto regard this farm as their centre of operations. I had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in inducing them to go home to their well-earned\r\ndinners. They wanted to camp out on the place. As it is, there may\r\nstill be some of them round, hiding in the grass with notebooks,\r\nand telling one another in whispers that they were the men who\r\nreally solved the murder mystery. What shall we do?'\r\n\r\nBill had no suggestions.\r\n\r\n'You realize our position? I wonder if we could be arrested for\r\nkidnapping. The monkey is far more human than most of the\r\nmillionaire children who get kidnapped. It's an awful fix. Did you\r\nknow that Lady Wetherby is going to offer a reward for the\r\nanimal?'\r\n\r\n'No, really?'\r\n\r\n'Five hundred dollars!'\r\n\r\n'Surely not!'\r\n\r\n'She is. I suppose she feels she can charge it up to necessary\r\nexpenses for publicity and still be ahead of the game, taking into\r\naccount the advertising she's going to get.'\r\n\r\n'She said nothing about that when I saw her.'\r\n\r\n'No, because it won't be offered until to-morrow or the day after.\r\nOne of the newspaper men told me that. The idea is, of course, to\r\nmake the thing exciting just when it would otherwise be dying as a\r\nnews item. Cumulative interest. It's a good scheme, too, but it\r\nmakes it very awkward for me. I don't want to be in the position\r\nof keeping a monkey locked up with the idea of waiting until\r\nsomebody starts a bull market in monkeys. I consider that that\r\nsort of thing would stain the spotless escutcheon of the Boyds. It\r\nwould be a low trick for that old-established family to play. Not\r\nbut what poor, dear Nutty would do it like a shot,' she concluded\r\nmeditatively.\r\n\r\nBill was impressed.\r\n\r\n'It does make it awkward, what?'\r\n\r\n'It makes it more than awkward, what! Take another aspect of the\r\nsituation. The night before last my precious Nutty, while ruining\r\nhis constitution with the demon rum, thought he saw a monkey that\r\nwasn't there, and instantly resolved to lead a new and better\r\nlife. He hates walking, but he has now begun to do his five miles\r\na day. He loathes cold baths, but he now wallows in them. I don't\r\nknow his views on Indian clubs, but I should think that he has a\r\nstrong prejudice against them, too, but now you can't go near him\r\nwithout taking a chance of being brained. Are all these good\r\nthings to stop as quickly as they began? If I know Nutty, he would\r\ndrop them exactly one minute after he heard that it was a real\r\nmonkey he saw that night. And how are we to prevent his hearing?\r\nBy a merciful miracle he was out taking his walk when the\r\nnewspaper men began to infest the place to-day, but that might not\r\nhappen another time. What conclusion does all this suggest to you,\r\nMr Chalmers?'\r\n\r\n'We ought to get rid of the animal.'\r\n\r\n'This very minute. But don't you bother to come. You must be tired\r\nout, poor thing.'\r\n\r\n'I never felt less tired,' said Bill stoutly.\r\n\r\nElizabeth looked at him in silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n'You're rather splendid, you know, Mr Chalmers. You make a great\r\npartner for an adventure of this kind. You're nice and solid.'\r\n\r\nThe outhouse lay in the neighbourhood of the hives, a gaunt,\r\nwooden structure surrounded by bushes. Elizabeth glanced over her\r\nshoulder as she drew the key from her pocket.\r\n\r\n'You can't think how nervous I was this afternoon,' she said. 'I\r\nthought every moment one of those newspaper men would look in\r\nhere. I--James! James! I thought I heard James in those bushes--I\r\nkept heading them away. Once I thought it was all up.' She\r\nunlocked the door. 'One of them was about a yard from the window,\r\njust going to look in. Thank goodness, a bee stung him at the\r\npsychological moment, and--Oh!'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?'\r\n\r\n'Come and get a banana.'\r\n\r\nThey walked to the house. On the way Elizabeth stopped.\r\n\r\n'Why, you haven't had any dinner either!' she said.\r\n\r\n'Never mind me,' said Bill, 'I can wait. Let's get this thing\r\nfinished first.'\r\n\r\n'You really are a sport, Mr Chalmers,' said Elizabeth gratefully.\r\n'It would kill me to wait a minute. I shan't feel happy until I've\r\ngot it over. Will you stay here while I go up and see that Nutty's\r\nsafe in his room?' she added as they entered the house.\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly. A feline howl had broken the stillness of\r\nthe night, followed instantly by a sharp report.\r\n\r\n'What was that?'\r\n\r\n'It sounded like a car backfiring.'\r\n\r\n'No, it was a shot. One of the neighbours, I expect. You can hear\r\nmiles away on a night like this. I suppose a cat was after his\r\nchickens. Thank goodness, James isn't a pirate cat. Wait while I\r\ngo up and see Nutty.'\r\n\r\nShe was gone only a moment.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' she said. 'I peeped in. He's doing deep\r\nbreathing exercises at his window which looks out the other way.\r\nCome along.'\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the outhouse they found the door open.\r\n\r\n'Did you do that?' said Elizabeth. 'Did you leave it open?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'I don't remember doing it myself. It must have swung open. Well,\r\nthis saves us a walk. He'll have gone.'\r\n\r\n'Better take a look round, what?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I suppose so; but he's sure not to be there. Have you a\r\nmatch?'\r\n\r\nBill struck one and held it up.\r\n\r\n'Good Lord!'\r\n\r\nThe match went out.\r\n\r\n'What is it? What has happened?'\r\n\r\nBill was fumbling for another match.\r\n\r\n'There's something on the floor. It looks like--I thought for a\r\nminute--' The small flame shot out of the gloom, flickered, then\r\nburned with a steady glow. Bill stooped, bending over something on\r\nthe ground. The match burned down.\r\n\r\nBill's voice came out of the darkness:\r\n\r\n'I say, you were right about that noise. It was a shot. The poor\r\nlittle chap's down there on the floor with a hole in him the size\r\nof my fist.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\nBoyhood, like measles, is one of those complaints which a man\r\nshould catch young and have done with, for when it comes in\r\nmiddle life it is apt to be serious. Dudley Pickering had escaped\r\nboyhood at the time when his contemporaries were contracting it.\r\nIt is true that for a few years after leaving the cradle he had\r\nexhibited a certain immatureness, but as soon as he put on\r\nknickerbockers and began to go about a little he outgrew all that.\r\nHe avoided altogether the chaotic period which usually lies\r\nbetween the years of ten and fourteen. At ten he was a thoughtful\r\nand sober-minded young man, at fourteen almost an old fogy.\r\n\r\nAnd now--thirty-odd years overdue--boyhood had come upon him. As\r\nhe examined the revolver in his bedroom, wild and unfamiliar\r\nemotions seethed within him. He did not realize it, but they were\r\nthe emotions which should have come to him thirty years before and\r\ndriven him out to hunt Indians in the garden. An imagination which\r\nmight well have become atrophied through disuse had him as\r\nthoroughly in its control as ever he had had his Pickering Giant.\r\n\r\nHe believed almost with devoutness in the plot which he had\r\ndetected for the spoliation of Lord Wetherby's summer-house, that\r\nplot of which he held Lord Dawlish to be the mainspring. And it\r\nmust be admitted that circumstances had combined to help his\r\nbelief. If the atmosphere in which he was moving was not sinister\r\nthen there was no meaning in the word.\r\n\r\nSummer homes had been burgled, there was no getting away from\r\nthat--half a dozen at least in the past two months. He was a\r\nstranger in the locality, so had no means of knowing that summer\r\nhomes were always burgled on Long Island every year, as regularly\r\nas the coming of the mosquito and the advent of the jelly-fish. It\r\nwas one of the local industries. People left summer homes lying\r\nabout loose in lonely spots, and you just naturally got in through\r\nthe cellar window. Such was the Long Islander's simple creed.\r\n\r\nThis created in Mr Pickering's mind an atmosphere of burglary, a\r\nreceptiveness, as it were, toward burglars as phenomena, and the\r\nextremely peculiar behaviour of the person whom in his thoughts he\r\nalways referred to as The Man crystallized it. He had seen The Man\r\nhanging about, peering in at windows. He had shouted 'Hi!' and The\r\nMan had run. The Man had got into the house under the pretence of\r\nbeing a friend of Claire's. At the suggestion that he should meet\r\nClaire he had dashed away in a panic. And Claire, both then and\r\nlater, had denied absolutely any knowledge of him.\r\n\r\nAs for the apparently blameless beekeeping that was going on at\r\nthe place where he lived, that was easily discounted. Mr Pickering\r\nhad heard somewhere or read somewhere--he rather thought that it\r\nwas in those interesting but disturbing chronicles of Raffles--that\r\nthe first thing an intelligent burglar did was to assume some\r\nopen and innocent occupation to avert possible inquiry into his\r\nreal mode of life. Mr Pickering did not put it so to himself, for\r\nhe was rarely slangy even in thought, but what he felt was that he\r\nhad caught The Man and his confederate with the goods.\r\n\r\nIf Mr Pickering had had his boyhood at the proper time and\r\nfinished with it, he would no doubt have acted otherwise than he\r\ndid. He would have contented himself with conducting a war of\r\ndefence. He would have notified the police, and considered that\r\nall that remained for him personally to do was to stay in his room\r\nat night with his revolver. But boys will be boys. The only course\r\nthat seemed to him in any way satisfactory in this his hour of\r\nrejuvenation was to visit the bee farm, the hotbed of crime, and\r\nkeep an eye on it. He wanted to go there and prowl.\r\n\r\nHe did not anticipate any definite outcome of his visit. In his\r\nboyish, elemental way he just wanted to take a revolver and a\r\npocketful of cartridges, and prowl.\r\n\r\nIt was a great night for prowling. A moon so little less than full\r\nthat the eye could barely detect its slight tendency to become\r\nconcave, shone serenely, creating a desirable combination of black\r\nshadows where the prowler might hide and great stretches of light\r\nin which the prowler might reveal his wickedness without disguise.\r\nMr Pickering walked briskly along the road, then less briskly as\r\nhe drew nearer the farm. An opportune belt of shrubs that ran from\r\nthe gate adjoining the road to a point not far from the house gave\r\nhim just the cover he needed. He slipped into this belt of shrubs\r\nand began to work his way through them.\r\n\r\nLike generals, authors, artists, and others who, after planning\r\nbroad effects, have to get down to the detail work, he found that\r\nthis was where his troubles began. He had conceived the journey\r\nthrough the shrubbery in rather an airy mood. He thought he would\r\njust go through the shrubbery. He had not taken into account the\r\nbranches, the thorns, the occasional unexpected holes, and he was\r\nboth warm and dishevelled when he reached the end of it and found\r\nhimself out in the open within a short distance of what he\r\nrecognized as beehives. It was not for some time that he was able\r\nto give that selfless attention to exterior objects which is the\r\nprowler's chief asset. For quite a while the only thought of which\r\nhe was conscious was that what he needed most was a cold drink and\r\na cold bath. Then, with a return to clear-headedness, he realized\r\nthat he was standing out in the open, visible from three sides to\r\nanyone who might be in the vicinity, and he withdrew into the\r\nshrubbery. He was not fond of the shrubbery, but it was a splendid\r\nplace to withdraw into. It swallowed you up.\r\n\r\nThis was the last move of the first part of Mr Pickering's active\r\ncampaign. He stayed where he was, in the middle of a bush, and\r\nwaited for the enemy to do something. What he expected him to do\r\nhe did not know. The subconscious thought that animated him was\r\nthat on a night like this something was bound to happen sooner or\r\nlater. Just such a thought on similarly stimulating nights had\r\nanimated men of his acquaintance thirty years ago, men who were\r\nas elderly and stolid and unadventurous now as Mr Pickering had\r\nbeen then. He would have resented the suggestion profoundly, but\r\nthe truth of the matter was that Dudley Pickering, after a late\r\nstart, had begun to play Indians.\r\n\r\nNothing had happened for a long time--for such a long time that,\r\nin spite of the ferment within him, Mr Pickering almost began to\r\nbelieve that nothing would happen. The moon shone with unutterable\r\ncalm. The crickets and the tree frogs performed their interminable\r\nduet, apparently unconscious that they were attacking it in\r\ndifferent keys--a fact that, after a while, began to infuriate\r\nMr Pickering. Mosquitoes added their reedy tenor to the concert.\r\nA twig on which he was standing snapped with a report like a pistol.\r\nThe moon went on shining.\r\n\r\nAway in the distance a dog began to howl. An automobile passed in\r\nthe road. For a few moments Mr Pickering was able to occupy\r\nhimself pleasantly with speculations as to its make; and then he\r\nbecame aware that something was walking down the back of his neck\r\njust beyond the point where his fingers could reach it. Discomfort\r\nenveloped Mr Pickering. At various times by day he had seen\r\nlong-winged black creatures with slim waists and unpleasant faces.\r\nCould it be one of these? Or a caterpillar? Or--and the maddening\r\nthing was that he did not dare to slap at it, for who knew what\r\ndesperate characters the sound might not attract?\r\n\r\nWell, it wasn't stinging him; that was something.\r\n\r\nA second howling dog joined the first one. A wave of sadness was\r\napparently afflicting the canine population of the district to-night.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering's vitality began to ebb. He was ageing, and\r\nimagination slackened its grip. And then, just as he had begun to\r\ncontemplate the possibility of abandoning the whole adventure and\r\nreturning home, he was jerked back to boyhood again by the sound\r\nof voices.\r\n\r\nHe shrank farther back into the bushes. A man--The Man--was\r\napproaching, accompanied by his female associate. They passed so\r\nclose to him that he could have stretched out a hand and touched\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe female associate was speaking, and her first words set all Mr\r\nPickering's suspicions dancing a dance of triumph. The girl gave\r\nherself away with her opening sentence.\r\n\r\n'You can't think how nervous I was this afternoon,' he heard her\r\nsay. She had a soft pleasant voice; but soft, pleasant voices may\r\nbe the vehicles for conveying criminal thoughts. 'I thought every\r\nmoment one of those newspaper men would look in here.'\r\n\r\nWhere was here? Ah, that outhouse! Mr Pickering had had his\r\nsuspicions of that outhouse already. It was one of those\r\nstructures that look at you furtively as if something were hiding\r\nin them.\r\n\r\n'James! James! I thought I heard James in those bushes.'\r\n\r\nThe girl was looking straight at the spot occupied by Mr\r\nPickering, and it had been the start caused by her first words and\r\nthe resultant rustle of branches that had directed her attention\r\nto him. He froze. The danger passed. She went on speaking. Mr\r\nPickering pondered on James. Who was James? Another of the gang,\r\nof course. How many of them were there?\r\n\r\n'Once I thought it was all up. One of them was about a yard from\r\nthe window, just going to look in.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering thrilled. There was something hidden in the outhouse,\r\nthen! Swag?\r\n\r\n'Thank goodness, a bee stung him at the psychological moment,\r\nand--oh!'\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and The Man spoke:\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?'\r\n\r\nIt interested Mr Pickering that The Man retained his English\r\naccent even when talking privately with his associates. For\r\npractice, no doubt.\r\n\r\n'Come and get a banana,' said the girl. And they went off together\r\nin the direction of the house, leaving Mr Pickering bewildered.\r\nWhy a banana? Was it a slang term of the underworld for a pistol?\r\nIt must be that.\r\n\r\nBut he had no time for speculation. Now was his chance, the only\r\nchance he would ever get of looking into that outhouse and finding\r\nout its mysterious contents. He had seen the girl unlock the door.\r\nA few steps would take him there. All it needed was nerve. With a\r\nstrong effort Mr Pickering succeeded in obtaining the nerve. He\r\nburst from his bush and trotted to the outhouse door, opened it,\r\nand looked in. And at that moment something touched his leg.\r\n\r\nAt the right time and in the right frame of mind man is capable of\r\nstoic endurances that excite wonder and admiration. Mr Pickering\r\nwas no weakling. He had once upset his automobile in a ditch, and\r\nhad waited for twenty minutes until help came to relieve a broken\r\narm, and he had done it without a murmur. But on the present\r\noccasion there was a difference. His mind was not adjusted for the\r\noccurrence. There are times when it is unseasonable to touch a man\r\non the leg. This was a moment when it was unseasonable in the case\r\nof Mr Pickering. He bounded silently into the air, his whole being\r\nrent asunder as by a cataclysm.\r\n\r\nHe had been holding his revolver in his hand as a protection\r\nagainst nameless terrors, and as he leaped he pulled the trigger.\r\nThen with the automatic instinct for self-preservation, he sprang\r\nback into the bushes, and began to push his way through them until\r\nhe had reached a safe distance from the danger zone.\r\n\r\nJames, the cat, meanwhile, hurt at the manner in which his\r\nfriendly move had been received, had taken refuge on the outhouse\r\nroof. He mewed complainingly, a puzzled note in his voice. Mr\r\nPickering's behaviour had been one of those things that no fellow\r\ncan understand. The whole thing seemed inexplicable to James.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish stood in the doorway of the outhouse, holding the\r\nbody of Eustace gingerly by the tail. It was a solemn moment.\r\nThere was no room for doubt as to the completeness of the\r\nextinction of Lady Wetherby's pet.\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering's bullet had done its lethal work. Eustace's\r\nadventurous career was over. He was through.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's mouth was trembling, and she looked very white in the\r\nmoonlight. Being naturally soft-hearted, she deplored the tragedy\r\nfor its own sake; and she was also, though not lacking in courage,\r\ndecidedly upset by the discovery that some person unknown had been\r\nroaming her premises with a firearm.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Bill!' she said. Then: 'Poor little chap!' And then: 'Who\r\ncould have done it?'\r\n\r\nLord Dawlish did not answer. His whole mind was occupied at the\r\nmoment with the contemplation of the fact that she had called him\r\nBill. Then he realized that she had spoken three times and\r\nexpected a reply.\r\n\r\n'Who could have done it?'\r\n\r\nBill pondered. Never a quick thinker, the question found him\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\n'Some fellow, I expect,' he said at last brightly. 'Got in, don't\r\nyou know, and then his pistol went off by accident.'\r\n\r\n'But what was he doing with a pistol?'\r\n\r\nBill looked a little puzzled at this.\r\n\r\n'Why, he would have a pistol, wouldn't he? I thought everybody\r\nhad over here.'\r\n\r\nExcept for what he had been able to observe during the brief\r\nperiod of his present visit, Lord Dawlish's knowledge of the\r\nUnited States had been derived from the American plays which he\r\nhad seen in London, and in these chappies were producing revolvers\r\nall the time. He had got the impression that a revolver was as\r\nmuch a part of the ordinary well-dressed man's equipment in the\r\nUnited States as a collar.\r\n\r\n'I think it was a burglar,' said Elizabeth. 'There have been a lot\r\nof burglaries down here this summer.'\r\n\r\n'Would a burglar burgle the outhouse? Rummy idea, rather, what?\r\nNot much sense in it. I think it must have been a tramp. I expect\r\ntramps are always popping about and nosing into all sorts of\r\nextraordinary places, you know.'\r\n\r\n'He must have been standing quite close to us while we were\r\ntalking,' said Elizabeth, with a shiver.\r\n\r\nBill looked about him. Everywhere was peace. No sinister sounds\r\ncompeted with the croaking of the tree frogs. No alien figures\r\ninfested the landscape. The only alien figure, that of Mr\r\nPickering, was wedged into a bush, invisible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\n'He's gone now, at any rate,' he said. 'What are we going to do?'\r\n\r\nElizabeth gave another shiver as she glanced hurriedly at the\r\ndeceased. After life's fitful fever Eustace slept well, but he was\r\nnot looking his best.\r\n\r\n'With--it?' she said.\r\n\r\n'I say,' advised Bill, 'I shouldn't call him \"it,\" don't you know.\r\nIt sort of rubs it in. Why not \"him\"? I suppose we had better bury\r\nhim. Have you a spade anywhere handy?'\r\n\r\n'There isn't a spade on the place.'\r\n\r\nBill looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\n'It takes weeks to make a hole with anything else, you know,' he\r\nsaid. 'When I was a kid a friend of mine bet me I wouldn't dig my\r\nway through to China with a pocket knife. It was an awful frost. I\r\ntried for a couple of days, and broke the knife and didn't get\r\nanywhere near China.' He laid the remains on the grass and\r\nsurveyed them meditatively. 'This is what fellows always run up\r\nagainst in the detective novels--What to Do With the Body. They\r\nmanage the murder part of it all right, and then stub their toes\r\non the body problem.'\r\n\r\n'I wish you wouldn't talk as if we had done a murder.'\r\n\r\n'I feel as if we had, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly.'\r\n\r\n'I read a story once where a fellow slugged somebody and melted\r\nthe corpse down in a bath tub with sulphuric--'\r\n\r\n'Stop! You're making me sick!'\r\n\r\n'Only a suggestion, don't you know,' said Bill apologetically.\r\n\r\n'Well, suggest something else, then.'\r\n\r\n'How about leaving him on Lady Wetherby's doorstep? See what I\r\nmean--let them take him in with the morning milk? Or, if you would\r\nrather ring the bell and go away, and--you don't think much of\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n'I simply haven't the nerve to do anything so risky.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I would do it. There would be no need for you to come.'\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't dream of deserting you.'\r\n\r\n'That's awfully good of you.'\r\n\r\n'Besides, I'm not going to be left alone to-night until I can jump\r\ninto my little white bed and pull the clothes over my head. I'm\r\nscared, I'm just boneless with fright. And I wouldn't go anywhere\r\nnear Lady Wetherby's doorstep with it.'\r\n\r\n'Him.'\r\n\r\n'It's no use, I can't think of it as \"him.\" It's no good asking me\r\nto.'\r\n\r\nBill frowned thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'I read a story once where two chappies wanted to get rid of a\r\nbody. They put it inside a fellow's piano.'\r\n\r\n'You do seem to have read the most horrible sort of books.'\r\n\r\n'I rather like a bit of blood with my fiction,' said Bill. 'What\r\nabout this piano scheme I read about?'\r\n\r\n'People only have talking machines in these parts.'\r\n\r\n'I read a story--'\r\n\r\n'Let's try to forget the stories you've read. Suggest something of\r\nyour own.'\r\n\r\n'Well, could we dissect the little chap?'\r\n\r\n'Dissect him?'\r\n\r\n'And bury him in the cellar, you know. Fellows do it to their\r\nwives.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth shuddered.\r\n\r\n'Try again,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Well, the only other thing I can think of is to take him into the\r\nwoods and leave him there. It's a pity we can't let Lady Wetherby\r\nknow where he is; she seems rather keen on him. But I suppose the\r\nmain point is to get rid of him.'\r\n\r\n'I know how we can do both. That's a good idea of yours about the\r\nwoods. They are part of Lady Wetherby's property. I used to wander\r\nabout there in the spring when the house was empty. There's a sort\r\nof shack in the middle of them. I shouldn't think anybody ever\r\nwent there--it's a deserted sort of place. We could leave him\r\nthere, and then--well, we might write Lady Wetherby a letter or\r\nsomething. We could think out that part afterward.'\r\n\r\n'It's the best thing we've thought of. You really want to come?'\r\n\r\n'If you attempt to leave here without me I shall scream. Let's be\r\nstarting.'\r\n\r\nBill picked Eustace up by his convenient tail.\r\n\r\n'I read a story once,' he said, 'where a fellow was lugging a\r\ncorpse through a wood, when suddenly--'\r\n\r\n'Stop right there,' said Elizabeth firmly.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation just recorded Dudley Pickering had been\r\nkeeping a watchful eye on Bill and Elizabeth from the interior of\r\na bush. His was not the ideal position for espionage, for he was\r\ntoo far off to hear what they said, and the light was too dim to\r\nenable him to see what it was that Bill was holding. It looked to\r\nMr Pickering like a sack or bag of some sort. As time went by he\r\nbecame convinced that it was a sack, limp and empty at present,\r\nbut destined later to receive and bulge with what he believed was\r\ntechnically known as the swag. When the two objects of vigilance\r\nconcluded their lengthy consultation, and moved off in the\r\ndirection of Lady Wetherby's woods, any doubts he may have had as\r\nto whether they were the criminals he had suspected them of being\r\nwere dispersed. The whole thing worked out logically.\r\n\r\nThe Man, having spied out the land in his two visits to Lady\r\nWetherby's house, was now about to break in. His accomplice would\r\nstand by with the sack. With a beating heart Mr Pickering gripped\r\nhis revolver and moved round in the shadow of the shrubbery till\r\nhe came to the gate, when he was just in time to see the guilty\r\ncouple disappear into the woods. He followed them. He was glad to\r\nget on the move again. While he had been wedged into the bush,\r\nquite a lot of the bush had been wedged into him. Something sharp\r\nhad pressed against the calf of his leg, and he had been pinched\r\nin a number of tender places. And he was convinced that one more\r\nof God's unpleasant creatures had got down the back of his neck.\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering moved through the wood as snakily as he could.\r\nNature had shaped him more for stability than for snakiness, but\r\nhe did his best. He tingled with the excitement of the chase, and\r\nendeavoured to creep through the undergrowth like one of those\r\nintelligent Indians of whom he had read so many years before in\r\nthe pages of Mr Fenimore Cooper. In those days Dudley Pickering\r\nhad not thought very highly of Fenimore Cooper, holding his work\r\ndeficient in serious and scientific interest; but now it seemed to\r\nhim that there had been something in the man after all, and he\r\nresolved to get some of his books and go over them again. He\r\nwished he had read them more carefully at the time, for they\r\ndoubtless contained much information and many hints which would\r\nhave come in handy just now. He seemed, for example, to recall\r\ncharacters in them who had the knack of going through forests\r\nwithout letting a single twig crack beneath their feet. Probably\r\nthe author had told how this was done. In his unenlightened state\r\nit was beyond Mr Pickering. The wood seemed carpeted with twigs.\r\nWhenever he stepped he trod on one, and whenever he trod on one it\r\ncracked beneath his feet. There were moments when he felt gloomily\r\nthat he might just as well be firing a machine-gun.\r\n\r\nBill, meanwhile, Elizabeth following close behind him, was\r\nploughing his way onward. From time to time he would turn to\r\nadminister some encouraging remark, for it had come home to him by\r\nnow that encouraging remarks were what she needed very much in the\r\npresent crisis of her affairs. She was showing him a new and\r\nhitherto unsuspected side of her character. The Elizabeth whom he\r\nhad known--the valiant, self-reliant Elizabeth--had gone, leaving\r\nin her stead someone softer, more appealing, more approachable. It\r\nwas this that was filling him with strange emotions as he led the\r\nway to their destination.\r\n\r\nHe was becoming more and more conscious of a sense of being drawn\r\nvery near to Elizabeth, of a desire to soothe, comfort, and protect\r\nher. It was as if to-night he had discovered the missing key to a\r\npuzzle or the missing element in some chemical combination. Like\r\nmost big men, his mind was essentially a protective mind; weakness\r\ndrew out the best that was in him. And it was only to-night that\r\nElizabeth had given any sign of having any weakness in her\r\ncomposition. That clear vision which had come to him on his long\r\nwalk came again now, that vivid conviction that she was the only\r\ngirl in the world for him.\r\n\r\nHe was debating within himself the advisability of trying to find\r\nwords to express this sentiment, when Mr Pickering, the modern\r\nChingachgook, trod on another twig in the background and Elizabeth\r\nstopped abruptly with a little cry.\r\n\r\n'What was that?' she demanded.\r\n\r\nBill had heard a noise too. It was impossible to be within a dozen\r\nyards of Mr Pickering, when on the trail, and not hear a noise.\r\nThe suspicion that someone was following them did not come to him,\r\nfor he was a man rather of common sense than of imagination, and\r\ncommon sense was asking him bluntly why the deuce anybody should\r\nwant to tramp after them through a wood at that time of night. He\r\ncaught the note of panic in Elizabeth's voice, and was soothing\r\nher.\r\n\r\n'It was just a branch breaking. You hear all sorts of rum noises\r\nin a wood.'\r\n\r\n'I believe it's the man with the pistol following us!'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense. Why should he? Silly thing to do!' He spoke almost\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\n'Look!' cried Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'I saw someone dodge behind that tree.'\r\n\r\n'You mustn't let yourself imagine things. Buck up!'\r\n\r\n'I can't buck up. I'm scared.'\r\n\r\n'Which tree did you think you saw someone dodge behind?'\r\n\r\n'That big one there.'\r\n\r\n'Well, listen: I'll go back and--'\r\n\r\n'If you leave me for an instant I shall die in agonies.' She\r\ngulped. 'I never knew I was such a coward before. I'm just a\r\nworm.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense. This sort of thing might frighten anyone. I read a\r\nstory once--'\r\n\r\n'Don't!'\r\n\r\nBill found that his heart had suddenly begun to beat with\r\nunaccustomed rapidity. The desire to soothe, comfort, and protect\r\nElizabeth became the immediate ambition of his life. It was very\r\ndark where they stood. The moonlight, which fell in little patches\r\nround them, did not penetrate the thicket which they had entered.\r\nHe could hardly see her. He was merely aware of her as a presence.\r\nAn excellent idea occurred to him.\r\n\r\n'Hold my hand,' he said.\r\n\r\nIt was what he would have said to a frightened child, and there was\r\nmuch of the frightened child about Elizabeth then. The Eustace mystery\r\nhad given her a shock which subsequent events had done nothing to\r\ndispel, and she had lost that jauntiness and self-confidence which was\r\nher natural armour against the more ordinary happenings of life.\r\n\r\nSomething small and soft slid gratefully into his palm, and there\r\nwas silence for a space. Bill said nothing. Elizabeth said\r\nnothing. And Mr Pickering had stopped treading on twigs. The\r\nfaintest of night breezes ruffled the tree-tops above them. The\r\nmoonbeams filtered through the branches. He held her hand tightly.\r\n\r\n'Better?'\r\n\r\n'Much.'\r\n\r\nThe breeze died away. Not a leaf stirred. The wood was very still.\r\nSomewhere on a bough a bird moved drowsily 'All right?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nAnd then something happened--something shattering, disintegrating.\r\nIt was only a pheasant, but it sounded like the end of the world.\r\nIt rose at their feet with a rattle that filled the universe, and\r\nfor a moment all was black confusion. And when that moment had\r\npassed it became apparent to Bill that his arm was round\r\nElizabeth, that she was sobbing helplessly, and that he was\r\nkissing her. Somebody was talking very rapidly in a low voice.\r\n\r\nHe found that it was himself.\r\n\r\n'Elizabeth!'\r\n\r\nThere was something wonderful about the name, a sort of music.\r\nThis was odd, because the name, as a name, was far from being a\r\nfavourite of his. Until that moment childish associations had\r\nprejudiced him against it. It had been inextricably involved in\r\nhis mind with an atmosphere of stuffy schoolrooms and general\r\nmisery, for it had been his misfortune that his budding mind was\r\nconstitutionally incapable of remembering who had been Queen of\r\nEngland at the time of the Spanish Armada--a fact that had caused\r\na good deal of friction with a rather sharp-tempered governess.\r\nBut now it seemed the only possible name for a girl to have, the\r\nonly label that could even remotely suggest those feminine charms\r\nwhich he found in this girl beside him. There was poetry in every\r\nsyllable of it. It was like one of those deep chords which fill\r\nthe hearer with vague yearnings for strange and beautiful things.\r\nHe asked for nothing better than to stand here repeating it.\r\n\r\n'Elizabeth!'\r\n\r\n'Bill, dear!'\r\n\r\nThat sounded good too. There was music in 'Bill' when properly\r\nspoken. The reason why all the other Bills in the world had got\r\nthe impression that it was a prosaic sort of name was that there\r\nwas only one girl in existence capable of speaking it properly,\r\nand she was not for them.\r\n\r\n'Bill, are you really fond of me?'\r\n\r\n'Fond of you!'\r\n\r\nShe gave a sigh. 'You're so splendid!'\r\n\r\nBill was staggered. These were strange words. He had never thought\r\nmuch of himself. He had always looked on himself as rather a\r\nchump--well-meaning, perhaps, but an awful ass. It seemed\r\nincredible that any one--and Elizabeth of all people--could look\r\non him as splendid.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the very fact that she had said it gave it a plausible\r\nsort of sound. It shook his convictions. Splendid! Was he? By\r\nJove, perhaps he was, what? Rum idea, but it grew on a chap.\r\nFilled with a novel feeling of exaltation, he kissed Elizabeth\r\neleven times in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nHe felt devilish fit. He would have liked to run a mile or two and\r\njump a few gates. He wished five or six starving beggars would\r\ncome along; it would be pleasant to give the poor blighters money.\r\nIt was too much to expect at that time of night, of course, but it\r\nwould be rather jolly if Jess Willard would roll up and try to\r\npick a quarrel. He would show him something. He felt grand and\r\nstrong and full of beans. What a ripping thing life was when you\r\ncame to think of it.\r\n\r\n'This,' he said, 'is perfectly extraordinary!' And time stood\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nA sense of something incongruous jarred upon Bill. Something\r\nseemed to be interfering with the supreme romance of that golden\r\nmoment. It baffled him at first. Then he realized that he was\r\nstill holding Eustace by the tail.\r\n\r\nDudley Pickering had watched these proceedings--as well as the\r\nfact that it was extremely dark and that he was endeavouring to\r\nhide a portly form behind a slender bush would permit him--with a\r\nsense of bewilderment. A comic artist drawing Mr Pickering at that\r\nmoment would no doubt have placed above his head one of those\r\nlarge marks of interrogation which lend vigour and snap to modern\r\ncomic art. Certainly such a mark of interrogation would have\r\nsummed up his feelings exactly. Of what was taking place he had\r\nnot the remotest notion. All he knew was that for some inexplicable\r\nreason his quarry had come to a halt and seemed to have settled down\r\nfor an indefinite stay. Voices came to him in an indistinguishable\r\nmurmur, intensely irritating to a conscientious tracker. One of\r\nFenimore Cooper's Indians--notably Chingachgook, if, which seemed\r\nincredible, that was really the man's name--would have crept up\r\nwithout a sound and heard what was being said and got in on the\r\nground floor of whatever plot was being hatched. But experience\r\nhad taught Mr Pickering that, superior as he was to Chingachgook\r\nand his friends in many ways, as a creeper he was not in their class.\r\nHe weighed thirty or forty pounds more than a first-class creeper\r\nshould. Besides, creeping is like golf. You can't take it up in the\r\nmiddle forties and expect to compete with those who have been at it\r\nfrom infancy.\r\n\r\nHe had resigned himself to an all-night vigil behind the bush,\r\nwhen to his great delight he perceived that things had begun to\r\nmove again. There was a rustling of feet in the undergrowth, and\r\nhe could just see two indistinct forms making their way among the\r\nbushes. He came out of his hiding place and followed stealthily,\r\nor as stealthily as the fact that he had not even taken a\r\ncorrespondence course in creeping allowed. And profiting by\r\nearlier mistakes, he did succeed in making far less noise than\r\nbefore. In place of his former somewhat elephantine method of\r\nprogression he adopted a species of shuffle which had excellent\r\nresults, for it enabled him to brush twigs away instead of\r\nstepping flatfootedly on them. The new method was slow, but it had\r\nno other disadvantages.\r\n\r\nBecause it was slow, Mr Pickering was obliged to follow his prey\r\nalmost entirely by ear. It was easy at first, for they seemed to\r\nbe hurrying on regardless of noise. Then unexpectedly the sounds\r\nof their passage ceased.\r\n\r\nHe halted. In his boyish way the first thing he thought was that\r\nit was an ambush. He had a vision of that large man suspecting his\r\npresence and lying in wait for him with a revolver. This was not a\r\ncomforting thought. Of course, if a man is going to fire a\r\nrevolver at you it makes little difference whether he is a giant\r\nor a pygmy, but Mr Pickering was in no frame of mind for nice\r\nreasoning. It was the thought of Bill's physique which kept him\r\nstanding there irresolute.\r\n\r\nWhat would Chingachgook--assuming, for purposes of argument, that\r\nany sane godfather could really have given a helpless child a name\r\nlike that--have done? He would, Mr Pickering considered, after\r\ngiving the matter his earnest attention, have made a _detour_\r\nand outflanked the enemy. An excellent solution of the difficulty.\r\nMr Pickering turned to the left and began to advance circuitously,\r\nwith the result that, before he knew what he was doing, he came\r\nout into a clearing and understood the meaning of the sudden\r\nsilence which had perplexed him. Footsteps made no sound on this\r\nmossy turf.\r\n\r\nHe knew where he was now; the clearing was familiar. This was\r\nwhere Lord Wetherby's shack-studio stood; and there it was, right\r\nin front of him, black and clear in the moonlight. And the two\r\ndark figures were going into it.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering retreated into the shelter of the bushes and mused\r\nupon this thing. It seemed to him that for centuries he had been\r\ndoing nothing but retreat into bushes for this purpose. His\r\nperplexity had returned. He could imagine no reason why burglars\r\nshould want to visit Lord Wetherby's studio. He had taken it for\r\ngranted, when he had tracked them to the clearing, that they were\r\non their way to the house, which was quite close to the shack,\r\nseparated from it only by a thin belt of trees and a lawn.\r\n\r\nThey had certainly gone in. He had seen them with his own eyes--first\r\nthe man, then very close behind him, apparently holding to his coat,\r\nthe girl. But why?\r\n\r\nCreep up and watch them? Would Chingachgook have taken a risk like\r\nthat? Hardly, unless insured with some good company. Then what? He\r\nwas still undecided when he perceived the objects of his attention\r\nemerging. He backed a little farther into the bushes.\r\n\r\nThey stood for an instant, listening apparently. The man no longer\r\ncarried the sack. They exchanged a few inaudible words. Then they\r\ncrossed the clearing and entered the wood a few yards to his\r\nright. He could hear the crackling of their footsteps diminishing\r\nin the direction of the road.\r\n\r\nA devouring curiosity seized upon Mr Pickering. He wanted, more\r\nthan he had wanted almost anything before in his life, to find out\r\nwhat the dickens they had been up to in there. He listened. The\r\nfootsteps were no longer audible. He ran across the clearing and\r\ninto the shack. It was then that he discovered that he had no\r\nmatches.\r\n\r\nThis needless infliction, coming upon him at the crisis of an\r\nadventurous night, infuriated Mr Pickering. He swore softly. He\r\ngroped round the walls for an electric-light switch, but the shack\r\nhad no electric-light switch. When there was need to illuminate it\r\nan oil lamp performed the duty. This occurred to Mr Pickering\r\nafter he had been round the place three times, and he ceased to\r\ngrope for a switch and began to seek for a match-box. He was still\r\nseeking it when he was frozen in his tracks by the sound of\r\nfootsteps, muffled but by their nearness audible, just outside the\r\ndoor. He pulled out his pistol, which he had replaced in his\r\npocket, backed against the wall, and stood there prepared to sell\r\nhis life dearly.\r\n\r\nThe door opened.\r\n\r\nOne reads of desperate experiences ageing people in a single\r\nnight. His present predicament aged Mr Pickering in a single\r\nminute. In the brief interval of time between the opening of the\r\ndoor and the moment when a voice outside began to speak he became\r\na full thirty years older. His boyish ardour slipped from him, and\r\nhe was once more the Dudley Pickering whom the world knew, the\r\nstaid and respectable middle-aged man of affairs, who would have\r\ngiven a million dollars not to have got himself mixed up in this\r\ndeplorable business.\r\n\r\nAnd then the voice spoke.\r\n\r\n'I'll light the lamp,' it said; and with an overpowering feeling\r\nof relief Mr Pickering recognized it as Lord Wetherby's. A moment\r\nlater the temperamental peer's dapper figure became visible in\r\nsilhouette against a background of pale light.\r\n\r\n'Ah-hum!' said Mr Pickering.\r\n\r\nThe effect on Lord Wetherby was remarkable. To hear some one clear\r\nhis throat at the back of a dark room, where there should\r\nrightfully be no throat to be cleared, would cause even your man\r\nof stolid habit a passing thrill. The thing got right in among\r\nLord Wetherby's highly sensitive ganglions like an earthquake. He\r\nuttered a strangled cry, then dashed out and slammed the door\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n'There's someone in there!'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby's tranquil voice made itself heard.\r\n\r\n'Nonsense; who could be in there?'\r\n\r\n'I heard him, I tell you. He growled at me!'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Mr Pickering that the time had come to relieve the\r\nmental distress which he was causing his host. He raised his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n'It's all right!' he called.\r\n\r\n'There!' said Lord Wetherby.\r\n\r\n'Who's that?' asked Lady Wetherby, through the door.\r\n\r\n'It's all right. It's me--Pickering.'\r\n\r\nThe door was opened a few inches by a cautious hand.\r\n\r\n'Is that you, Pickering?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. It's all right.'\r\n\r\n'Don't keep saying it's all right,' said Lord Wetherby, irritably.\r\n'It isn't all right. What do you mean by hiding in the dark and\r\npopping out and barking at a man? You made me bite my tongue. I've\r\nnever had such a shock in my life.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering left his lair and came out into the open. Lord\r\nWetherby was looking aggrieved, Lady Wetherby peacefully\r\ninquisitive. For the first time Mr Pickering discovered that\r\nClaire was present. She was standing behind Lady Wetherby with a\r\nfloating white something over her head, looking very beautiful.\r\n\r\n'For the love of Mike!' said Lady Wetherby.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering became aware that he was still holding the revolver.\r\n\r\n'Oh, ah!' he said, and pocketed the weapon.\r\n\r\n'Barking at people!' muttered Lord Wetherby in a querulous\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n'What on earth are you doing, Dudley?' said Claire.\r\n\r\nThere was a note in her voice which both puzzled and pained Mr\r\nPickering, a note that seemed to suggest that she found herself in\r\nimperfect sympathy with him. Her expression deepened the\r\nsuggestion. It was a cold expression, unfriendly, as if it was not\r\nso keen a pleasure to Claire to look at him as it should be for a\r\ngirl to look at the man whom she is engaged to marry. He had\r\nnoticed the same note in her voice and the same hostile look in\r\nher eye earlier in the evening. He had found her alone, reading a\r\nletter which, as the stamp on the envelope showed, had come from\r\nEngland. She had seemed so upset that he had asked her if it\r\ncontained bad news, and she had replied in the negative with so\r\nmuch irritation that he had desisted from inquiries. But his own\r\nidea was that she had had bad news from home. Mr Pickering still\r\nclung to his early impression that her little brother Percy was\r\nconsumptive, and he thought the child must have taken a turn for\r\nthe worse. It was odd that she should have looked and spoken like\r\nthat then, and it was odd that she should look and speak like that\r\nnow. He had been vaguely disturbed then and he was vaguely\r\ndisturbed now. He had the feeling that all was not well.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Lady Wetherby. 'What on earth are you doing, Dudley?'\r\n\r\n'Popping out!' grumbled Lord Wetherby.\r\n\r\n'We came here to see Algie's picture, which has got something\r\nwrong with its eyes apparently, and we find you hiding in the dark\r\nwith a gun. What's the idea?'\r\n\r\n'It's a long story,' said Mr Pickering.\r\n\r\n'We have the night before us,' said Lady Wetherby.\r\n\r\n'You remember The Man--the fellow I found looking in at the\r\nwindow, The Man who said he knew Claire?'\r\n\r\n'You've got that man on the brain, Dudley. What's he been doing to\r\nyou now?'\r\n\r\n'I tracked him here.'\r\n\r\n'Tracked him? Where from?'\r\n\r\n'From that bee-farm place where he's living. He and that girl you\r\nspoke of went into these woods. I thought they were making for the\r\nhouse, but they went into the shack.'\r\n\r\n'What did they do then?' asked Lady Wetherby.\r\n\r\n'They came out again.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'That's what I was trying to find out.'\r\n\r\nLord Wetherby uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' There was apprehension in his voice, but mingled with\r\nit a certain pleased surprise. 'Perhaps they were after my\r\npicture. I'll light the lamp. Good Lord, picture\r\nthieves--Romneys--missing Gainsboroughs--' His voice trailed off\r\nas he found the lamp and lit it. Relief and disappointment were\r\nnicely blended in his next words: 'No, it's still there.'\r\n\r\nThe soft light of the lamp filled the studio.\r\n\r\n'Well, that's a comfort,' said Lady Wetherby, sauntering in. 'We\r\ncouldn't afford to lose--Oh!'\r\n\r\nLord Wetherby spun round as her scream burst upon his already\r\ntortured nerve centres. Lady Wetherby was kneeling on the floor.\r\nClaire hurried in.\r\n\r\n'What is it, Polly?'\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby rose to her feet, and pointed. Her face had lost its\r\nlook of patient amusement. It was hard and set. She eyed Mr\r\nPickering in a menacing way.\r\n\r\n'Look!'\r\n\r\nClaire followed her finger.\r\n\r\n'Good gracious! It's Eustace!'\r\n\r\n'Shot!'\r\n\r\nShe was looking intently at Mr Pickering. 'Well, Dudley,' she\r\nsaid, coldly, 'what about it?'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering found that they were all looking at him--Lady\r\nWetherby with glittering eyes, Claire with cool scorn, Lord\r\nWetherby with a horror which he seemed to have achieved with\r\nsomething of an effort.\r\n\r\n'Well!' said Claire.\r\n\r\n'What about it, Dudley?' said Lady Wetherby.\r\n\r\n'I must say, Pickering,' said Lord Wetherby, 'much as I disliked\r\nthe animal, it's a bit thick!'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering recoiled from their accusing gaze.\r\n\r\n'Good heavens! Do you think I did it?'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his anguish there flashed across his mind the\r\nrecollection of having seen just this sort of situation in a\r\nmoving picture, and of having thought it far-fetched.\r\n\r\nLady Wetherby's good-tempered mouth, far from good-tempered now,\r\ncurled in a devastating sneer. She was looking at him as Claire,\r\nin the old days when they had toured England together in road\r\ncompanies, had sometimes seen her look at recalcitrant landladies.\r\nThe landladies, without exception, had wilted beneath that gaze,\r\nand Mr Pickering wilted now.\r\n\r\n'But--but--but--' was all he could contrive to say.\r\n\r\n'Why should we think you did it?' said Lady Wetherby, bitterly.\r\n'You had a grudge against the poor brute for biting you. We find\r\nyou hiding here with a pistol and a story about burglars which an\r\ninfant couldn't swallow. I suppose you thought that, if you\r\nplanted the poor creature's body here, it would be up to Algie to\r\nget rid of it, and that if he were found with it I should think\r\nthat it was he who had killed the animal.'\r\n\r\nThe look of horror which Lord Wetherby had managed to assume\r\nbecame genuine at these words. The gratitude which he had been\r\nfeeling towards Mr Pickering for having removed one of the chief\r\ntrials of his existence vanished.\r\n\r\n'Great Scot!' he cried. 'So that was the game, was it?'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering struggled for speech. This was a nightmare.\r\n\r\n'But I didn't! I didn't! I didn't! I tell you I hadn't the\r\nremotest notion the creature was there.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, come, Pickering!' said Lord Wetherby. 'Come, come, come!'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering found that his accusers were ebbing away. Lady\r\nWetherby had gone. Claire had gone. Only Lord Wetherby remained,\r\nlooking at him like a pained groom. He dashed from the place and\r\nfollowed his hostess, speaking incoherently of burglars,\r\nouthouses, and misunderstandings. He even mentioned Chingachgook.\r\nBut Lady Wetherby would not listen. Nobody would listen.\r\n\r\nHe found Lord Wetherby at his side, evidently prepared to go\r\ndeeper into the subject. Lord Wetherby was looking now like a\r\ngroom whose favourite horse has kicked him in the stomach.\r\n\r\n'Wouldn't have thought it of you, Pickering,' said Lord Wetherby.\r\nMr Pickering found no words. 'Wouldn't, honestly. Low trick!'\r\n\r\n'But I tell you--'\r\n\r\n'Devilish low trick!' repeated Lord Wetherby, with a shake of the\r\nhead. 'Laws of hospitality--eaten our bread and salt, what!--all\r\nthat sort of thing--kill valuable monkey--not done, you know--low,\r\nvery low!'\r\n\r\nAnd he followed his wife, now in full retreat, with scorn and\r\nrepulsion written in her very walk.\r\n\r\n'Mr Pickering!'\r\n\r\nIt was Claire. She stood there, holding something towards him,\r\nsomething that glittered in the moonlight. Her voice was hard, and\r\nthe expression on her face suggested that in her estimation he was\r\na particularly low-grade worm, one of the submerged tenth of the\r\nworm world.\r\n\r\n'Eh?' said Mr Pickering, dazedly.\r\n\r\nHe looked at what she had in her hand, but it conveyed nothing to\r\nhis overwrought mind.\r\n\r\n'Take it!'\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\nClaire stamped.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' she said.\r\n\r\nShe flung something on the ground before him--a small, sparkling\r\nobject. Then she swept away, his eyes following her, and was lost\r\nin the darkness of the trees. Mechanically Mr Pickering stooped to\r\npick up what she had let fall. He recognized it now. It was her\r\nengagement ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\r\nBill leaned his back against the gate that separated the grounds of\r\nthe bee-farm from the high road and mused pleasantly. He was alone.\r\nElizabeth was walking up the drive on her way to the house to tell\r\nthe news to Nutty. James, the cat, who had come down from the roof\r\nof the outhouse, was sharpening his claws on a neighbouring tree.\r\nAfter the whirl of excitement that had been his portion for the past\r\nfew hours, the peace of it all appealed strongly to Bill. It suited\r\nthe mood of quiet happiness which was upon him.\r\n\r\nQuietly happy, that was how he felt now that it was all over. The\r\nwhite heat of emotion had subsided to a gentle glow of contentment\r\nconducive to thought. He thought tenderly of Elizabeth. She had\r\nturned to wave her hand before going into the house, and he was\r\nstill smiling fatuously. Wonderful girl! Lucky chap he was! Rum,\r\nthe way they had come together! Talk about Fate, what?\r\n\r\nHe stooped to tickle James, who had finished stropping his claws\r\nand was now enjoying a friction massage against his leg, and began\r\nto brood on the inscrutable way of Fate.\r\n\r\nRum thing, Fate! Most extraordinary!\r\n\r\nSuppose he had never gone down to Marvis Bay that time. He had\r\nwavered between half a dozen places; it was pure chance that he\r\nhad chosen Marvis Bay. If he hadn't he would never have met old\r\nNutcombe. Probably old Nutcombe had wavered between half a dozen\r\nplaces too. If they hadn't both happened to choose Marvis Bay they\r\nwould never have met. And if they hadn't been the only visitors\r\nthere they might never have got to know each other. And if old\r\nNutcombe hadn't happened to slice his approach shots he would\r\nnever have put him under an obligation. Queer old buster, old\r\nNutcombe, leaving a fellow he hardly knew from Adam a cool million\r\nquid just because he cured him of slicing.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point in his meditations that it suddenly occurred to\r\nBill that he had not yet given a thought to what was immeasurably\r\nthe most important of any of the things that ought to be occupying\r\nhis mind just now. What was he to do about this Lord Dawlish\r\nbusiness?\r\n\r\nLife at Brookport had so accustomed him to being plain Bill\r\nChalmers that it had absolutely slipped his mind that he was\r\nreally Lord Dawlish, the one man in the world whom Elizabeth\r\nlooked on as an enemy. What on earth was he to do about that? Tell\r\nher? But if he told her, wouldn't she chuck him on the spot?\r\n\r\nThis was awful. The dreamy sense of well-being left him. He\r\nstraightened himself to face this problem, ignoring the hint of\r\nJames, who was weaving circles about his legs expectant of more\r\ntickling. A man cannot spend his time tickling cats when he has to\r\nconcentrate on a dilemma of this kind.\r\n\r\nSuppose he didn't tell her? How would that work out? Was a marriage\r\nlegal if the cove who was being married went through it under a\r\nfalse name? He seemed to remember seeing a melodrama in his boyhood\r\nthe plot of which turned on that very point. Yes, it began to come\r\nback to him. An unpleasant bargee with a black moustache had said,\r\n'This woman is not your wife!' and caused the dickens of a lot of\r\nunpleasantness; but there in its usual slipshod way memory failed.\r\nHad subsequent events proved the bargee right or wrong? It was a\r\nquestion for a lawyer to decide. Jerry Nichols would know. Well,\r\nthere was plenty of time, thank goodness, to send Jerry Nichols a\r\ncable, asking for his professional opinion, and to get the straight\r\ntip long before the wedding day arrived.\r\n\r\nLaying this part of it aside for the moment, and assuming that the\r\nthing could be worked, what about the money? Like a chump, he had\r\ntold Elizabeth on the first day of his visit that he hadn't any\r\nmoney except what he made out of his job as secretary of the club.\r\nHe couldn't suddenly spring five million dollars on her and\r\npretend that he had forgotten all about it till then.\r\n\r\nOf course, he could invent an imaginary uncle or something, and\r\nmassacre him during the honeymoon. Something in that. He pictured\r\nthe thing in his mind. Breakfast: Elizabeth doling out the\r\nscrambled eggs. 'What's the matter, Bill? Why did you exclaim like\r\nthat? Is there some bad news in the letter you are reading?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, it's nothing--only my Uncle John's died and left me five\r\nmillion dollars.'\r\n\r\nThe scene worked out so well that his mind became a little above\r\nitself. It suggested developments of serpentine craftiness. Why\r\nnot get Jerry Nichols to write him a letter about his Uncle John\r\nand the five millions? Jerry liked doing that sort of thing. He\r\nwould do it like a shot, and chuck in a lot of legal words to make\r\nit sound right. It began to be clear to Bill that any move he\r\ntook--except full confession, at which he jibbed--was going to\r\ninvolve Jerry Nichols as an ally; and this discovery had a\r\nsoothing effect on him. It made him feel that the responsibility\r\nhad been shifted. He couldn't do anything till he had consulted\r\nJerry, so there was no use in worrying. And, being one of those\r\nrare persons who can cease worrying instantly when they have\r\nconvinced themselves that it is useless, he dismissed the entire\r\nproblem from his mind and returned to the more congenial\r\noccupation of thinking of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIt was a peculiar feature of his position that he found himself\r\nunable to think of Elizabeth without thinking of Claire. He tried\r\nto, but failed. Every virtue in Elizabeth seemed to call up the\r\nrecollection of a corresponding defect in Claire. It became almost\r\nmathematical. Elizabeth was so straight on the level they called\r\nit over here. Claire was a corkscrew among women. Elizabeth was\r\nsunny and cheerful. Querulousness was Claire's besetting sin.\r\nElizabeth was such a pal. Claire had never been that. The effect\r\nthat Claire had always had on him was to deepen the conviction,\r\nwhich never really left him, that he was a bit of an ass.\r\nElizabeth, on the other hand, bucked him up and made him feel as\r\nif he really amounted to something.\r\n\r\nHow different they were! Their very voices--Elizabeth had a sort\r\nof quiet, soothing, pleasant voice, the kind of voice that somehow\r\nsuggested that she thought a lot of a chap without her having to\r\nsay it in so many words. Whereas Claire's voice--he had noticed it\r\nright from the beginning--Claire's voice--\r\n\r\nWhile he was trying to make clear to himself just what it was\r\nabout Claire's voice that he had not liked he was granted the\r\nopportunity of analysing by means of direct observation its\r\nfailure to meet his vocal ideals, for at this moment it spoke\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n'Bill!'\r\n\r\nShe was standing in the road, her head still covered with that\r\nwhite, filmy something which had commended itself to Mr Pickering's\r\neyes. She was looking at him in a way that seemed somehow to strike\r\na note of appeal. She conveyed an atmosphere of softness and\r\nrepentance, a general suggestion of prodigal daughters revisiting\r\nold homesteads.\r\n\r\n'We seem always to be meeting at gates, don't we?' she said, with\r\na faint smile.\r\n\r\nIt was a deprecating smile, wistful.\r\n\r\n'Bill!' she said again, and stopped. She laid her left hand\r\nlightly on the gate. Bill had a sort of impression that there was\r\nsome meaning behind this action; that, if he were less of a chump\r\nthan Nature had made him, he would at this point receive some sort\r\nof a revelation. But, being as Nature had made him, he did not get\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those men to whom a girl's left hand is simply a\r\ngirl's left hand, irrespective of whether it wears rings on its\r\nthird finger or not.\r\n\r\nThis having become evident to Claire after a moment of silence,\r\nshe withdrew her hand in rather a disappointed way and prepared to\r\nattack the situation from another angle.\r\n\r\n'Bill, I've come to say something to you.'\r\n\r\nBill was looking at her curiously. He could not have believed\r\nthat, even after what had happened, he could face her with such\r\ncomplete detachment; that she could so extraordinarily not matter.\r\nHe felt no resentment toward her. It was simply that she had gone\r\nout of his life.\r\n\r\n'Bill, I've been a fool.'\r\n\r\nHe made no reply to this for he could think of no reply that was\r\nsufficiently polite. 'Yes?' sounded as if he meant to say that\r\nthat was just what he had expected. 'Really?' had a sarcastic\r\nring. He fell back on facial expression, to imply that he was\r\ninterested and that she might tell all.\r\n\r\nClaire looked away down the road and began to speak in a low,\r\nquick voice:\r\n\r\n'I've been a fool all along. I lost you through being a fool. When\r\nI saw you dancing with that girl in the restaurant I didn't stop\r\nto think. I was angry. I was jealous. I ought to have trusted you,\r\nbut--Oh, well, I was a fool.'\r\n\r\n'My dear girl, you had a perfect right--'\r\n\r\n'I hadn't. I was an idiot. Bill, I've come to ask you if you can't\r\nforgive me.'\r\n\r\n'I wish you wouldn't talk like that--there's nothing to forgive.'\r\n\r\nThe look which Claire gave him in answer to this was meek and\r\naffectionate, but inwardly she was wishing that she could bang his\r\nhead against the gate. His slowness was maddening. Long before\r\nthis he should have leaped into the road in order to fold her in\r\nhis arms. Her voice shook with the effort she had to make to keep\r\nit from sharpness.\r\n\r\n'I mean, is it too late? I mean, can you really forgive me? Oh,\r\nBill'--she stopped herself by the fraction of a second from adding\r\n'you idiot'--'can't we be the same again to each other? Can't\r\nwe--pretend all this has never happened?'\r\n\r\nExasperating as Bill's wooden failure to play the scene in the\r\nspirit in which her imagination had conceived it was to Claire,\r\nseveral excuses may be offered for him: He had opened the evening\r\nwith a shattering blow at his faith in woman. He had walked twenty\r\nmiles at a rapid pace. He had heard shots and found a corpse, and\r\ncarried the latter by the tail across country. Finally, he had had\r\nthe stunning shock of discovering that Elizabeth Boyd loved him.\r\nHe was not himself. He found a difficulty in concentrating. With\r\nthe result that, in answer to this appeal from a beautiful girl\r\nwhom he had once imagined that he loved, all he could find to say\r\nwas: 'How do you mean?'\r\n\r\nClaire, never an adept at patience, just succeeded in swallowing\r\nthe remark that sprang into her mind. It was incredible to her\r\nthat a man could exist who had so little intuition. She had not\r\nanticipated the necessity of being compelled to put the substance\r\nof her meaning in so many blunt words, but it seemed that only so\r\ncould she make him understand.\r\n\r\n'I mean, can't we be engaged again, Bill?'\r\n\r\nBill's overtaxed brain turned one convulsive hand-spring, and came\r\nto rest with a sense of having dislocated itself. This was too\r\nmuch. This was not right. No fellow at the end of a hard evening\r\nought to have to grapple with this sort of thing. What on earth\r\ndid she mean, springing questions like that on him? How could they\r\nbe engaged? She was going to marry someone else, and so was he.\r\nSomething of these thoughts he managed to put into words:\r\n\r\n'But you're engaged to--'\r\n\r\n'I've broken my engagement with Mr Pickering.'\r\n\r\n'Great Scot! When?'\r\n\r\n'To-night. I found out his true character. He is cruel and\r\ntreacherous. Something happened--it may sound nothing to you, but\r\nit gave me an insight into what he really was. Polly Wetherby had\r\na little monkey, and just because it bit Mr Pickering he shot it.'\r\n\r\n'Pickering!'\r\n\r\n'Yes. He wasn't the sort of man I should have expected to do a\r\nmean, cruel thing like that. It sickened me. I gave him back his\r\nring then and there. Oh, what a relief it was! What a fool I was\r\never to have got engaged to such a man.'\r\n\r\nBill was puzzled. He was one of those simple men who take their\r\nfellows on trust, but who, if once that trust is shattered, can\r\nnever recover it. Like most simple men, he was tenacious of ideas\r\nwhen he got them, and the belief that Claire was playing fast and\r\nloose was not lightly to be removed from his mind. He had found\r\nher out during his self-communion that night, and he could never\r\nbelieve her again. He had the feeling that there was something\r\nbehind what she was saying. He could not put his finger on the\r\nclue, but that there was a clue he was certain.\r\n\r\n'I only got engaged to him out of pique. I was angry with you,\r\nand--Well, that's how it happened.'\r\n\r\nStill Bill could not believe. It was plausible. It sounded true.\r\nAnd yet some instinct told him that it was not true. And while he\r\nwaited, perplexed, Claire made a false step.\r\n\r\nThe thing had been so close to the top of her mind ever since she\r\nhad come to the knowledge of it that it had been hard for her to\r\nkeep it down. Now she could keep it down no longer.\r\n\r\n'How wonderful about old Mr Nutcombe, Bill!' she said.\r\n\r\nA vast relief rolled over Bill. Despite his instinct, he had been\r\nwavering. But now he understood. He had found the clue.\r\n\r\n'You got my letter, then?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; it was forwarded on from the theatre. I got it to-night.'\r\n\r\nToo late she realized what she had said and the construction that\r\nan intelligent man would put on it. Then she reflected that Bill\r\nwas not an intelligent man. She shot a swift glance at him. To all\r\nappearances he had suspected nothing.\r\n\r\n'It went all over the place,' she hurried on. 'The people at the\r\nPortsmouth theatre sent it to the London office, who sent it home,\r\nand mother mailed it on to me.'\r\n\r\n'I see.'\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Claire drew a step nearer.\r\n\r\n'Bill!' she said softly.\r\n\r\nBill shut his eyes. The moment had come which he had dreaded. Not\r\neven the thought that she was crooked, that she had been playing\r\nwith him, could make it any better. She was a woman and he was a\r\nman. That was all that mattered, and nothing could alter it.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' he said. 'It's impossible.'\r\n\r\nClaire stared at him in amazement. She had not been prepared for\r\nthis. He met her eyes, but every nerve in his body was protesting.\r\n\r\n'Bill!'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n'But, Bill!'\r\n\r\nHe set his teeth. It was just as bad as he had thought it would\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n'But, Bill, I've explained. I've told you how--'\r\n\r\n'I know.'\r\n\r\nClaire's eyes opened wide.\r\n\r\n'I thought you loved me.' She came closer. She pulled at his\r\nsleeve. Her voice took on a note of soft raillery. 'Don't be\r\nabsurd, Bill! You mustn't behave like a sulky schoolboy. It isn't\r\nlike you, this. You surely don't want me to humble myself more\r\nthan I have done.' She gave a little laugh. 'Why, Bill, I'm\r\nproposing to you! I know I've treated you badly, but I've\r\nexplained why. You must be just enough to see that it wasn't\r\naltogether my fault. I'm only human. And if I made a mistake I've\r\ndone all I can do to undo it. I--'\r\n\r\n'Claire, listen: I'm engaged!'\r\n\r\nShe fell back. For the first time the sense of defeat came to her.\r\nShe had anticipated many things. She had looked for difficulties.\r\nBut she had not expected this. A feeling of cold fury surged over\r\nher at the way fate had tricked her. She had gambled recklessly on\r\nher power of fascination, and she had lost.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering, at that moment brooding in solitude in the smoking-room\r\nof Lady Wetherby's house, would have been relieved could he have\r\nknown how wistfully she was thinking of him.\r\n\r\n'You're engaged?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Well!' She forced another laugh. 'How very--rapid of you! To\r\nwhom?'\r\n\r\n'To Elizabeth Boyd.'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid I'm very ignorant, but who is Elizabeth Boyd? The\r\nornate lady you were dancing with at the restaurant?'\r\n\r\n'No!'\r\n\r\n'Who then?'\r\n\r\n'She is old Ira Nutcombe's niece. The money ought to have been\r\nleft to her. That was why I came over to America, to see if I\r\ncould do anything for her.'\r\n\r\n'And you're going to marry her? How very romantic--and convenient!\r\nWhat an excellent arrangement for her. Which of you suggested it?'\r\n\r\nBill drew in a deep breath. All this was, he supposed,\r\nunavoidable, but it was not pleasant.\r\n\r\nClaire suddenly abandoned her pose of cool amusement. The fire\r\nbehind it blazed through.\r\n\r\n'You fool!' she cried passionately. 'Are you blind? Can't you see\r\nthat this girl is simply after your money? A child could see it.'\r\n\r\nBill looked at her steadily.\r\n\r\n'You're quite wrong. She doesn't know who I am.'\r\n\r\n'Doesn't know who you are? What do you mean? She must know by this\r\ntime that her uncle left his money to you.'\r\n\r\n'But she doesn't know that I am Lord Dawlish. I came to America\r\nunder another name. She knows me as Chalmers.'\r\n\r\nClaire was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n'How did you get to know her?' she asked, more quietly.\r\n\r\n'I met her brother by chance in New York.'\r\n\r\n'By chance!'\r\n\r\n'Quite by chance. A man I knew in England lent me his rooms in New\r\nYork. He happened to be a friend of Boyd's. Boyd came to call on\r\nhim one night, and found me.'\r\n\r\n'Odd! Had your mutual friend been away from New York long?'\r\n\r\n'Some months.'\r\n\r\n'And in all that time Mr Boyd had not discovered that he had left.\r\nThey must have been great friends! What happened then?'\r\n\r\n'Boyd invited me down here.'\r\n\r\n'Down here?'\r\n\r\n'They live in this house.'\r\n\r\n'Is Miss Boyd the girl who keeps the bee-farm?'\r\n\r\n'She is.'\r\n\r\nClaire's eyes suddenly lit up. She began to speak in a louder\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n'Bill, you're an infant, a perfect infant! Of course, she's after\r\nyour money. Do you really imagine for one instant that this\r\nElizabeth Boyd of yours and her brother don't know as well as I do\r\nthat you are really Lord Dawlish? I always thought you had a\r\ntrustful nature! You tell me the brother met you by chance.\r\nChance! And invited you down here. I bet he did! He knew his\r\nbusiness! And now you're going to marry the girl so that they will\r\nget the money after all! Splendid! Oh, Bill, you're a wonderful,\r\nwonderful creature! Your innocence is touching.'\r\n\r\nShe swung round.\r\n\r\n'Good night,' she called over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe could hear her laughing as she went down the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the smoking-room of Lady Wetherby's house, chewing the dead\r\nstump of a once imposing cigar, Dudley Pickering sat alone with\r\nhis thoughts. He had been alone for half an hour now. Once Lord\r\nWetherby had looked in, to withdraw at once coldly, with the\r\nexpression of a groom who has found loathsome things in the\r\nharness-room. Roscoe Sherriff, good, easy man, who could never\r\ndislike people, no matter what they had done, had come for a while\r\nto bear him company; but Mr Pickering's society was not for the\r\ntime being entertaining. He had answered with grunts the\r\nPress-agent's kindly attempts at conversation, and the latter\r\nhad withdrawn to seek a more congenial audience. And now Mr\r\nPickering was alone, talking things over with his subconscious\r\nself.\r\n\r\nA man's subconscious self is not the ideal companion. It lurks for\r\nthe greater part of his life in some dark den of its own, hidden\r\naway, and emerges only to taunt and deride and increase the misery\r\nof a miserable hour. Mr Pickering's rare interviews with his\r\nsubconscious self had happened until now almost entirely in the\r\nsmall hours of the night, when it had popped out to remind him, as\r\nhe lay sleepless, that all flesh was grass and that he was not\r\ngetting any younger. To-night, such had been the shock of the\r\nevening's events, it came to him at a time which was usually his\r\nhappiest--the time that lay between dinner and bed. Mr Pickering\r\nat that point of the day was generally feeling his best. But to-night\r\nwas different from the other nights of his life.\r\n\r\nOne may picture Subconscious Self as a withered, cynical,\r\nmalicious person standing before Mr Pickering and regarding him\r\nwith an evil smile. There has been a pause, and now Subconscious\r\nSelf speaks again:\r\n\r\n'You will have to leave to-morrow. Couldn't possibly stop on after\r\nwhat's happened. Now you see what comes of behaving like a boy.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering writhed.\r\n\r\n'Made a pretty considerable fool of yourself, didn't you, with\r\nyour revolvers and your hidings and your trailings? Too old for\r\nthat sort of thing, you know. You're getting on. Probably have a\r\ntouch of lumbago to-morrow. You must remember you aren't a\r\nyoungster. Got to take care of yourself. Next time you feel an\r\nimpulse to hide in shrubberies and take moonlight walks through\r\ndamp woods, perhaps you will listen to me.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering relit the stump of his cigar defiantly and smoked in\r\nlong gulps for a while. He was trying to persuade himself that all\r\nthis was untrue, but it was not easy. The cigar became uncomfortably\r\nhot, and he threw it away. He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and\r\nproduced a diamond ring, at which he looked pensively.\r\n\r\n'A pretty thing, is it not?' said Subconscious Self.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering sighed. That moment when Claire had thrown the ring\r\nat his feet and swept out of his life like an offended queen had\r\nbeen the culminating blow of a night of blows, the knock-out\r\nfollowing on a series of minor punches. Subconscious Self seized\r\nthe opportunity to become offensive again.\r\n\r\n'You've lost her, all through your own silly fault,' it said. 'How\r\non earth you can have been such a perfect fool beats me. Running\r\nround with a gun like a boy of fourteen! Well, it's done now and\r\nit can't be mended. Countermand the order for cake, send a wire\r\nputting off the wedding, dismiss the bridesmaids, tell the\r\norganist he can stop practising \"The Voice that Breathed O'er\r\nEden\"--no wedding-bells for you! For Dudley Damfool Pickering,\r\nEsquire, the lonely hearth for evermore! Little feet pattering\r\nabout the house? Not on your life! Childish voices sticking up the\r\nold man for half a dollar to buy candy? No, sir! Not for D.\r\nBonehead Pickering, the amateur trailing arbutus!'\r\n\r\nSubconscious Self may have had an undesirable way of expressing\r\nitself, but there was no denying the truth of what it said. Its\r\nwords carried conviction. Mr Pickering replaced the ring in his\r\npocket, and, burying his head in his hands, groaned in bitterness\r\nof spirit.\r\n\r\nHe had lost her. He must face the fact. She had thrown him over.\r\nNever now would she sit at his table, the brightest jewel of\r\nDetroit's glittering social life. She would have made a stir in\r\nDetroit. Now that city would never know her. Not that he was\r\nworrying much about Detroit. He was worrying about himself. How\r\ncould he ever live without her?\r\n\r\nThis mood of black depression endured for a while, and then Mr\r\nPickering suddenly became aware that Subconscious Self was\r\nsneering at him. 'You're a wonder!' said Subconscious Self.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Why, trying to make yourself think that at the bottom of your\r\nheart you aren't tickled to death that this has happened. You know\r\nperfectly well that you're tremendously relieved that you haven't\r\ngot to marry the girl after all. You can fool everybody else, but\r\nyou can't fool me. You're delighted, man, delighted!' The mere\r\nsuggestion revolted Mr Pickering. He was on the point of indignant\r\ndenial, when quite abruptly there came home to him the suspicion\r\nthat the statement was not so preposterous after all. It seemed\r\nincredible and indecent that such a thing should be, but he could\r\nnot deny, now that it was put to him point-blank in this way, that\r\na certain sense of relief was beginning to mingle itself with his\r\ngloom. It was shocking to realize, but--yes, he actually was\r\nfeeling as if he had escaped from something which he had dreaded.\r\nHalf an hour ago there had been no suspicion of such an emotion\r\namong the many which had occupied his attention, but now he\r\nperceived it clearly. Half an hour ago he had felt like Lucifer\r\nhurled from heaven. Now, though how that train of thought had\r\nstarted he could not have said, he was distinctly conscious of the\r\nsilver lining. Subconscious Self began to drive the thing home.\r\n\r\n'Be honest with yourself,' it said. 'You aren't often. No man is.\r\nLook at the matter absolutely fairly. You know perfectly well that\r\nthe mere idea of marriage has always scared you. You hate making\r\nyourself conspicuous in public. Think what it would be like,\r\nstanding up there in front of all the world and getting married.\r\nAnd then--afterwards! Why on earth do you think that you would\r\nhave been happy with this girl? What do you know about her except\r\nthat she is a beauty? I grant you she's that, but are you aware of\r\nthe infinitesimal part looks play in married life? My dear chap,\r\nbetter is it for a man that he marry a sympathetic gargoyle than a\r\nVenus with a streak of hardness in her. You know--and you would\r\nadmit it if you were honest with yourself--that this girl is hard.\r\nShe's got a chilled-steel soul.\r\n\r\n'If you wanted to marry some one--and there's no earthly reason\r\nwhy you should, for your life's perfectly full and happy with your\r\nwork--this is the last girl you ought to marry. You're a middle-aged\r\nman. You're set. You like life to jog along at a peaceful walk.\r\nThis girl wants it to be a fox-trot. You've got habits which\r\nyou have had for a dozen years. I ask you, is she the sort of girl\r\nto be content to be a stepmother to a middle-aged man's habits? Of\r\ncourse, if you were really in love with her, if she were your\r\nmate, and all that sort of thing, you would take a pleasure in\r\nmaking yourself over to suit her requirements. But you aren't in\r\nlove with her. You are simply caught by her looks. I tell you, you\r\nought to look on that moment when she gave you back your ring as\r\nthe luckiest moment of your life. You ought to make a sort of\r\nanniversary of it. You ought to endow a hospital or something out\r\nof pure gratitude. I don't know how long you're going to live--if\r\nyou act like a grown-up man instead of a boy and keep out of woods\r\nand shrubberies at night you may live for ever--but you will never\r\nhave a greater bit of luck than the one that happened to you\r\nto-night.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering was convinced. His spirits soared. Marriage! What was\r\nmarriage? Slavery, not to be endured by your man of spirit. Look\r\nat all the unhappy marriages you saw everywhere. Besides, you had\r\nonly to recall some of the novels and plays of recent years to get\r\nthe right angle on marriage. According to the novelists and\r\nplaywrights, shrewd fellows who knew what was what, if you talked\r\nto your wife about your business she said you had no soul; if you\r\ndidn't, she said you didn't think enough of her to let her share\r\nyour life. If you gave her expensive presents and an unlimited\r\ncredit account, she complained that you looked on her as a mere\r\ndoll; and if you didn't, she called you a screw. That was\r\nmarriage. If it didn't get you with the left jab, it landed on you\r\nwith the right upper-cut. None of that sort of thing for Dudley\r\nPickering.\r\n\r\n'You're absolutely right,' he said, enthusiastically. 'Funny I\r\nnever looked at it that way before.'\r\n\r\nSomebody was turning the door-handle. He hoped it was Roscoe\r\nSherriff. He had been rather dull the last time Sherriff had\r\nlooked in. He would be quite different now. He would be gay and\r\nsparkling. He remembered two good stories he would like to tell\r\nSherriff.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Claire came in. There was a silence. She stood\r\nlooking at him in a way that puzzled Mr Pickering. If it had not\r\nbeen for her attitude at their last meeting and the manner in\r\nwhich she had broken that last meeting up, he would have said that\r\nher look seemed somehow to strike a note of appeal. There was\r\nsomething soft and repentant about her. She suggested, it seemed\r\nto Mr Pickering, the prodigal daughter revisiting the old\r\nhomestead.\r\n\r\n'Dudley!'\r\n\r\nShe smiled a faint smile, a wistful, deprecating smile. She was\r\nlooking lovelier than ever. Her face glowed with a wonderful\r\ncolour and her eyes were very bright. Mr Pickering met her gaze,\r\nand strange things began to happen to his mind, that mind which a\r\nmoment before had thought so clearly and established so definite a\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nWhat a gelatine-backboned thing is man, who prides himself on his\r\nclear reason and becomes as wet blotting-paper at one glance from\r\nbright eyes! A moment before Mr Pickering had thought out the\r\nwhole subject of woman and marriage in a few bold flashes of his\r\ncapable brain, and thanked Providence that he was not as those men\r\nwho take unto themselves wives to their undoing. Now in an instant\r\nhe had lost that iron outlook. Reason was temporarily out of\r\nbusiness. He was slipping.\r\n\r\n'Dudley!'\r\n\r\nFor a space Subconscious Self thrust itself forward.\r\n\r\n'Look out! Be careful!' it warned.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering ignored it. He was watching, fascinated, the glow on\r\nClaire's face, her shining eyes.\r\n\r\n'Dudley, I want to speak to you.'\r\n\r\n'Tell her you can only be seen by appointment! Escape! Bolt!'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering did not bolt. Claire came towards him, still smiling\r\nthat pathetic smile. A thrill permeated Mr Pickering's entire one\r\nhundred and ninety-seven pounds, trickling down his spine like hot\r\nwater and coming out at the soles of his feet. He had forgotten\r\nnow that he had ever sneered at marriage. It seemed to him now\r\nthat there was nothing in life to be compared with that beatific\r\nstate, and that bachelors were mere wild asses of the desert.\r\n\r\nClaire came and sat down on the arm of his chair. He moved\r\nconvulsively, but he stayed where he was.\r\n\r\n'Fool!' said Subconscious Self.\r\n\r\nClaire took hold of his hand and patted it. He quivered, but\r\nremained.\r\n\r\n'Ass!' hissed Subconscious Self.\r\n\r\nClaire stopped patting his hand and began to stroke it. Mr\r\nPickering breathed heavily.\r\n\r\n'Dudley, dear,' said Claire, softly, 'I've been an awful fool, and\r\nI'm dreadful, dreadful sorry, and you're going to be the nicest,\r\nkindest, sweetest man on earth and tell me you've forgiven me.\r\nAren't you?'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering's lips moved silently. Claire kissed the thinning\r\nsummit of his head. There was a pause.\r\n\r\n'Where is it?' she asked.\r\n\r\nMr Pickering started.\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'Where is it? Where did you put it? The ring, silly!'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering became aware that Subconscious Self was addressing\r\nhim. The occasion was tense, and Subconscious Self did not mince\r\nits words.\r\n\r\n'You poor, maudlin, sentimental, doddering chunk of imbecility,'\r\nit said; 'are there no limits to your insanity? After all I said\r\nto you just now, are you deliberately going to start the old\r\nidiocy all over again?'\r\n\r\n'She's so beautiful!' pleaded Mr Pickering. 'Look at her eyes!'\r\n\r\n'Ass! Don't you remember what I said about beauty?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know, but--'\r\n\r\n'She's as hard as nails.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sure you're wrong.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not wrong.'\r\n\r\n'But she loves me.'\r\n\r\n'Forget it!'\r\n\r\nClaire jogged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n'Dudley, dear, what are you sitting there dreaming for? Where did\r\nyou put the ring?'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering fumbled for it, located it, produced it. Claire\r\nexamined it fondly.\r\n\r\n'Did she throw it at him and nearly break his heart!' she said.\r\n\r\n'Bolt!' urged Subconscious Self. 'Fly! Go to Japan!'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering did not go to Japan. He was staring worshippingly at\r\nClaire. With rapturous gaze he noted the grey glory of her eyes,\r\nthe delicate curve of her cheek, the grace of her neck. He had no\r\ntime to listen to pessimistic warnings from any Gloomy Gus of a\r\nSubconscious Self. He was ashamed that he had ever even for a\r\nmoment allowed himself to be persuaded that Claire was not all\r\nthat was perfect. No more doubts and hesitations for Dudley\r\nPickering. He was under the influence.\r\n\r\n'There!' said Claire, and slipped the ring on her finger.\r\n\r\nShe kissed the top of his head once more.\r\n\r\n'So there we are!' she said.\r\n\r\n'There we are!' gurgled the infatuated Dudley.\r\n\r\n'Happy now?'\r\n\r\n'Ur-r!'\r\n\r\n'Then kiss me.'\r\n\r\nMr Pickering kissed her.\r\n\r\n'Dudley, darling,' said Claire, 'we're going to be awfully,\r\nawfully happy, aren't we?'\r\n\r\n'You bet we are!' said Mr Pickering.\r\n\r\nSubconscious Self said nothing, being beyond speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some minutes after Claire had left him Bill remained where he\r\nwas, motionless. He felt physically incapable of moving. All the\r\nstrength that was in him he was using to throw off the insidious\r\npoison of her parting speech, and it became plainer to him with\r\neach succeeding moment that he would have need of strength.\r\n\r\nIt is part of the general irony of things that in life's crises a\r\nman's good qualities are often the ones that help him least, if\r\nindeed they do not actually turn treacherously and fight against\r\nhim. It was so with Bill. Modesty, if one may trust to the verdict\r\nof the mass of mankind, is a good quality. It sweetens the soul\r\nand makes for a kindly understanding of one's fellows. But\r\narrogance would have served Bill better now. It was his fatal\r\nhabit of self-depreciation that was making Claire's words so\r\nspecious as he stood there trying to cast them from his mind. Who\r\nwas he, after all, that he should imagine that he had won on his\r\npersonal merits a girl like Elizabeth Boyd?\r\n\r\nHe had the not very common type of mind that perceives the merit\r\nin others more readily than their faults, and in himself the\r\nfaults more readily than the merit. Time and the society of a\r\ngreat number of men of different ranks and natures had rid him of\r\nthe outer symbol of this type of mind, which is shyness, but it\r\nhad left him still unconvinced that he amounted to anything very\r\nmuch as an individual.\r\n\r\nThis was the thought that met him every time he tried to persuade\r\nhimself that what Claire had said was ridiculous, the mere parting\r\nshaft of an angry woman. With this thought as an ally her words\r\ntook on a plausibility hard to withstand. Plausible! That was the\r\ndevil of it. By no effort could he blind himself to the fact that\r\nthey were that. In the light of Claire's insinuations what had\r\nseemed coincidences took on a more sinister character. It had\r\nseemed to him an odd and lucky chance that Nutty Boyd should have\r\ncome to the rooms which he was occupying that night, seeking a\r\ncompanion. Had it been chance? Even at the time he had thought it\r\nstrange that, on the strength of a single evening spent together,\r\nNutty should have invited a total stranger to make an indefinite\r\nvisit to his home. Had there been design behind the invitation?\r\n\r\nBill began to walk slowly to the house. He felt tired and unhappy.\r\nHe meant to go to bed and try to sleep away these wretched doubts\r\nand questionings. Daylight would bring relief.\r\n\r\nAs he reached the open front door he caught the sound of voices,\r\nand paused for an instant, almost unconsciously, to place them.\r\nThey came from one of the rooms upstairs. It was Nutty speaking\r\nnow, and it was impossible for Bill not to hear what he said, for\r\nNutty had abandoned his customary drawl in favour of a high,\r\nexcited tone.\r\n\r\n'Of course, you hate him and all that,' said Nutty; 'but after all\r\nyou will be getting five million dollars that ought to have come\r\nto--'\r\n\r\nThat was all that Bill heard, for he had stumbled across the hall\r\nand was in his room, sitting on the bed and staring into the\r\ndarkness with burning eyes. The door banged behind him.\r\n\r\nSo it was true!\r\n\r\nThere came a knock at the door. It was repeated. The handle\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n'Is that you, Bill?'\r\n\r\nIt was Elizabeth's voice. He could just see her, framed in the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n'Bill!'\r\n\r\nHis throat was dry. He swallowed, and found that he could speak.\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'Did you just come in?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Then--you heard?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Then the door closed gently and he heard\r\nher go upstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Bill woke next morning it was ten o'clock; and his first\r\nemotion, on a day that was to be crowded with emotions of various\r\nkinds, was one of shame. The desire to do the fitting thing is\r\ninnate in man, and it struck Bill, as he hurried through his\r\ntoilet, that he must be a shallow, coarse-fibred sort of person,\r\nlacking in the finer feelings, not to have passed a sleepless\r\nnight. There was something revolting in the thought that, in\r\ncircumstances which would have made sleep an impossibility for\r\nmost men, he had slept like a log. He did not do himself the\r\njustice to recollect that he had had a singularly strenuous day,\r\nand that it is Nature's business, which she performs quietly and\r\nunromantically, to send sleep to tired men regardless of their\r\nprivate feelings; and it was in a mood of dissatisfaction with the\r\nquality of his soul that he left his room.\r\n\r\nHe had a general feeling that he was not much of a chap and that\r\nwhen he died--which he trusted would be shortly--the world would\r\nbe well rid of him. He felt humble and depressed and hopeless.\r\n\r\nElizabeth met him in the passage. At the age of eleven or\r\nthereabouts women acquire a poise and an ability to handle\r\ndifficult situations which a man, if he is lucky, manages to\r\nachieve somewhere in the later seventies. Except for a pallor\r\nstrange to her face and a drawn look about her eyes, there was\r\nnothing to show that all was not for the best with Elizabeth in a\r\nbest of all possible worlds. If she did not look jaunty, she at\r\nleast looked composed. She greeted Bill with a smile.\r\n\r\n'I didn't wake you. I thought I would let you sleep on.'\r\n\r\nThe words had the effect of lending an additional clarity and\r\nfirmness of outline to the picture of himself which Bill had\r\nalready drawn in his mind--of a soulless creature sunk in hoggish\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n'We've had breakfast. Nutty has gone for a walk. Isn't he\r\nwonderful nowadays? I've kept your breakfast warm for you.'\r\n\r\nBill protested. He might be capable of sleep, but he was not going\r\nto sink to food.\r\n\r\n'Not for me, thanks,' he said, hollowly.\r\n\r\n'Come along.'\r\n\r\n'Honestly--'\r\n\r\n'Come along.'\r\n\r\nHe followed her meekly. How grimly practical women were! They let\r\nnothing interfere with the essentials of life. It seemed all\r\nwrong. Nevertheless, he breakfasted well and gratefully, Elizabeth\r\nwatching him in silence across the table.\r\n\r\n'Finished?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, thanks.'\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n'Well, Bill, I've slept on it. Things are in rather a muddle,\r\naren't they? I think I had better begin by explaining what led up\r\nto those words you heard Nutty say last night. Won't you smoke?'\r\n\r\n'No, thanks.'\r\n\r\n'You'll feel better if you do.'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't.'\r\n\r\nA bee had flown in through the open window. She followed it with\r\nher eye as it blundered about the room. It flew out again into the\r\nsunshine. She turned to Bill again.\r\n\r\n'They were supposed to be words of consolation,' she said.\r\n\r\nBill said nothing.\r\n\r\n'Nutty, you see, has his own peculiar way of looking at things,\r\nand it didn't occur to him that I might have promised to marry you\r\nbecause I loved you. He took it for granted that I had done it to\r\nsave the Boyd home. He has been very anxious from the first that I\r\nshould marry you. I think that that must have been why he asked\r\nyou down here. He found out in New York, you know, who you were.\r\nSomeone you met at supper recognized you, and told Nutty. So, as\r\nfar as that is concerned, the girl you were speaking to at the\r\ngate last night was right.'\r\n\r\nHe started. 'You heard her?'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't help it. She meant me to hear. She was raising her\r\nvoice quite unnecessarily if she did not mean to include me in the\r\nconversation. I had gone in to find Nutty, and he was out, and I\r\nwas coming back to you. That's how I was there. You didn't see me\r\nbecause your back was turned. She saw me.'\r\n\r\nBill met her eyes. 'You don't ask who she was?'\r\n\r\n'It doesn't matter who she was. It's what she said that matters.\r\nShe said that we knew you were Lord Dawlish.'\r\n\r\n'Did you know?'\r\n\r\n'Nutty told me two or three days ago.' Her voice shook and a flush\r\ncame into her face. 'You probably won't believe it, but the news\r\nmade absolutely no difference to me one way or the other. I had\r\nalways imagined Lord Dawlish as a treacherous, adventurer sort of\r\nman, because I couldn't see how a man who was not like that could\r\nhave persuaded Uncle Ira to leave him his money. But after knowing\r\nyou even for this short time, I knew you were quite the opposite of\r\nthat, and I remembered that the first thing you had done on coming\r\ninto the money had been to offer me half, so the information that\r\nyou were the Lord Dawlish whom I had been hating did not affect me.\r\nAnd the fact that you were rich and I was poor did not affect me\r\neither. I loved you, and that was all I cared about. If all this had\r\nnot happened everything would have been all right. But, you see,\r\nnine-tenths of what that girl said to you was so perfectly true that\r\nit is humanly impossible for you not to believe the other tenth,\r\nwhich wasn't. And then, to clinch it, you hear Nutty consoling me.\r\nThat brings me back to Nutty.'\r\n\r\n'I--'\r\n\r\n'Let me tell you about Nutty first. I said that he had always been\r\nanxious that I should marry you. Something happened last night to\r\nincrease his anxiety. I have often wondered how he managed to get\r\nenough money to enable him to spend three days in New York, and\r\nlast night he told me. He came in just after I had got back to the\r\nhouse after leaving you and that girl, and he was very scared. It\r\nseems that when the letter from the London lawyer came telling him\r\nthat he had been left a hundred dollars, he got the idea of\r\nraising money on the strength of it. You know Nutty by this time,\r\nso you won't be surprised at the way he went about it. He borrowed\r\na hundred dollars from the man at the chemist's on the security of\r\nthat letter, and then--I suppose it seemed so easy that it struck\r\nhim as a pity to let the opportunity slip--he did the same thing\r\nwith four other tradesmen. Nutty's so odd that I don't know even\r\nnow whether it ever occurred to him that he was obtaining money\r\nunder false pretences; but the poor tradesmen hadn't any doubt\r\nabout it at all. They compared notes and found what had happened,\r\nand last night, while we were in the woods, one of them came here\r\nand called Nutty a good many names and threatened him with\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n'You can imagine how delighted Nutty was when I came in and told\r\nhim that I was engaged to you. In his curious way, he took it for\r\ngranted that I had heard about his financial operations, and was\r\ndoing it entirely for his sake, to get him out of his fix. And\r\nwhile I was trying to put him right on that point he began to\r\nconsole me. You see, Nutty looks on you as the enemy of the\r\nfamily, and it didn't strike him that it was possible that I\r\ndidn't look on you in that light too. So, after being delighted\r\nfor a while, he very sweetly thought that he ought to cheer me up\r\nand point out some of the compensations of marriage with you.\r\nAnd--Well, that was what you heard. There you have the full\r\nexplanation. You can't possibly believe it.'\r\n\r\nShe broke off and began to drum her fingers on the table. And as\r\nshe did so there came to Bill a sudden relief from all the doubts\r\nand black thoughts that had tortured him. Elizabeth was straight.\r\nWhatever appearances might seem to suggest, nothing could convince\r\nhim that she was playing an underhand game. It was as if something\r\nevil had gone out of him. He felt lighter, cleaner. He could\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\n'I do believe it,' he said. 'I believe every word you say.'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n'You can't in the face of the evidence.'\r\n\r\n'I believe it.'\r\n\r\n'No. You may persuade yourself for the moment that you do, but\r\nafter a while you will have to go by the evidence. You won't be\r\nable to help yourself. You haven't realized what a crushing thing\r\nevidence is. You have to go by it against your will. You see,\r\nevidence is the only guide. You don't know that I am speaking the\r\ntruth; you just feel it. You're trusting your heart and not your\r\nhead. The head must win in the end. You might go on believing for\r\na time, but sooner or later you would be bound to begin to doubt\r\nand worry and torment yourself. You couldn't fight against the\r\nevidence, when once your instinct--or whatever it is that tells\r\nyou that I am speaking the truth--had begun to weaken. And it\r\nwould weaken. Think what it would have to be fighting all the\r\ntime. Think of the case your intelligence would be making out, day\r\nafter day, till it crushed you. It's impossible that you could\r\nkeep yourself from docketing the evidence and arranging it and\r\nabsorbing it. Think! Consider what you know are actual facts!\r\nNutty invites you down here, knowing that you are Lord Dawlish.\r\nAll you know about my attitude towards Lord Dawlish is what I told\r\nyou on the first morning of your visit. I told you I hated him.\r\nYet, knowing you are Lord Dawlish, I become engaged to you.\r\nDirectly afterwards you hear Nutty consoling me as if I were\r\nmarrying you against my will. Isn't that an absolutely fair\r\nstatement of what has happened? How could you go on believing me\r\nwith all that against you?'\r\n\r\n'I know you're straight. You couldn't do anything crooked.'\r\n\r\n'The evidence proves that I did.'\r\n\r\n'I don't care.'\r\n\r\n'Not now.'\r\n\r\n'Never.'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n'It's dear of you, Bill, but you're promising an impossibility.\r\nAnd just because it's impossible, and because I love you too much\r\nto face what would be bound to happen, I'm going to send you\r\naway.'\r\n\r\n'Send me away!'\r\n\r\n'Yes. It's going to hurt. You don't know how it's going to hurt,\r\nBill; but it's the only thing to do. I love you too much to live\r\nwith you for the rest of my life wondering all the time whether\r\nyou still believed or whether the weight of the evidence had\r\ncrushed out that tiny little spark of intuition which is all that\r\nmakes you believe me now. You could never know the truth for\r\ncertain, you see--that's the horror of it; and sometimes you would\r\nbe able to make yourself believe, but more often, in spite of all\r\nyou could do, you would doubt. It would poison both our lives.\r\nLittle things would happen, insignificant in themselves, which\r\nwould become tremendously important just because they added a\r\nlittle bit more to the doubt which you would never be able to get\r\nrid of.\r\n\r\n'When we had quarrels--which we should, as we are both human--they\r\nwouldn't be over and done with in an hour. They would stick in\r\nyour mind and rankle, because, you see, they might be proofs that\r\nI didn't really love you. And then when I seemed happy with you,\r\nyou would wonder if I was acting. I know all this sounds morbid\r\nand exaggerated, but it isn't. What have you got to go on, as\r\nregards me? What do you really know of me? If something like this\r\nhad happened after we had been married half a dozen years and\r\nreally knew each other, we could laugh at it. But we are\r\nstrangers. We came together and loved each other because there was\r\nsomething in each of us which attracted the other. We took that\r\nlittle something as a foundation and built on it. But what has\r\nhappened has knocked away our poor little foundation. That's all.\r\nWe don't really know anything at all about each other for certain.\r\nIt's just guesswork.'\r\n\r\nShe broke off and looked at the clock.\r\n\r\n'I had better be packing if you're to catch the train.'\r\n\r\nHe gave a rueful laugh.\r\n\r\n'You're throwing me out!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I am. I want you to go while I am strong enough to let you\r\ngo.'\r\n\r\n'If you really feel like that, why send me away?'\r\n\r\n'How do you know I really feel like that? How do you know that I\r\nam not pretending to feel like that as part of a carefully-prepared\r\nplan?'\r\n\r\nHe made an impatient gesture.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know,' she said. 'You think I am going out of my way to\r\nmanufacture unnecessary complications. I'm not; I'm simply looking\r\nahead. If I were trying to trap you for the sake of your money,\r\ncould I play a stronger card than by seeming anxious to give you\r\nup? If I were to give in now, sooner or later that suspicion would\r\ncome to you. You would drive it away. You might drive it away a\r\nhundred times. But you couldn't kill it. In the end it would beat\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders helplessly.\r\n\r\n'I can't argue.'\r\n\r\n'Nor can I. I can only put very badly things which I know are\r\ntrue. Come and pack.'\r\n\r\n'I'll do it. Don't you bother.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense! No man knows how to pack properly.'\r\n\r\nHe followed her to his room, pulled out his suitcase, the symbol\r\nof the end of all things, watched her as she flitted about, the\r\nsun shining on her hair as she passed and repassed the window. She\r\nwas picking things up, folding them, packing them. Bill looked on\r\nwith an aching sense of desolation. It was all so friendly, so\r\nintimate, so exactly as it would have been if she were his wife.\r\nIt seemed to him needlessly cruel that she should be playing on\r\nthis note of domesticity at the moment when she was barring for\r\never the door between him and happiness. He rebelled helplessly\r\nagainst the attitude she had taken. He had not thought it all out,\r\nas she had done. It was folly, insanity, ruining their two lives\r\nlike this for a scruple.\r\n\r\nOnce again he was to encounter that practical strain in the\r\nfeminine mind which jars upon a man in trouble. She was holding\r\nsomething in her hand and looking at it with concern.\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you tell me?' she said. 'Your socks are in an awful\r\nstate, poor boy!'\r\n\r\nHe had the feeling of having been hit by something. A man has not\r\na woman's gift of being able to transfer his mind at will from\r\nsorrow to socks.\r\n\r\n'Like sieves!' She sighed. A troubled frown wrinkled her forehead.\r\n'Men are so helpless! Oh, dear, I'm sure you don't pay any\r\nattention to anything important. I don't believe you ever bother\r\nyour head about keeping warm in winter and not getting your feet\r\nwet. And now I shan't be able to look after you!'\r\n\r\nBill's voice broke. He felt himself trembling.\r\n\r\n'Elizabeth!'\r\n\r\nShe was kneeling on the floor, her head bent over the suitcase.\r\nShe looked up and met his eyes.\r\n\r\n'It's no use, Bill, dear. I must. It's the only way.'\r\n\r\nThe sense of the nearness of the end broke down the numbness\r\nwhich held him.\r\n\r\n'Elizabeth! It's so utterly absurd. It's just--chucking everything\r\naway!'\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n'Bill, dear, I haven't said anything about it before but don't you\r\nsee that there's my side to be considered too? I only showed you\r\nthat you could never possibly know that I loved you. How am I to\r\nknow that you really love me?'\r\n\r\nHe had moved a step towards her. He drew back, chilled.\r\n\r\n'I can't do more than tell you,' he said.\r\n\r\n'You can't. And there you have put in two words just what I've\r\nbeen trying to make clear all the time. Don't you see that that's\r\nthe terrible thing about life, that nobody can do more than tell\r\nanybody anything? Life's nothing but words, words, words; and how\r\nare we to know when words are true? How am I to know that you\r\ndidn't ask me to marry you out of sheer pity and an exaggerated\r\nsense of justice?'\r\n\r\nHe stared at her.\r\n\r\n'That,' he said, 'is absolutely ridiculous!'\r\n\r\n'Why? Look at it as I should look at it later on, when whatever it\r\nis inside me that tell me it's ridiculous now had died. Just at\r\nthis moment, while we're talking here, there's something stronger\r\nthan reason which tells me you really do love me. But can't you\r\nunderstand that that won't last? It's like a candle burning on a\r\nrock with the tide coming up all round it. It's burning brightly\r\nenough now, and we can see the truth by the light of it. But the\r\ntide will put it out, and then we shall have nothing left to see\r\nby. There's a great black sea of suspicion and doubt creeping up\r\nto swamp the little spark of intuition inside us.\r\n\r\n'I will tell you what would happen to me if I didn't send you\r\naway. Remember I heard what that girl was saying last night.\r\nRemember that you hated the thought of depriving me of Uncle Ira's\r\nmoney so much that your first act was to try to get me to accept\r\nhalf of it. The quixotic thing is the first that it occurs to you\r\nto do, because you're like that, because you're the straightest,\r\nwhitest man I've ever known or shall know. Could anything be more\r\nlikely, looking at it as I should later on, than that you should\r\nhave hit on the idea of marrying me as the only way of undoing the\r\nwrong you thought you had done me? I've been foolish about\r\nobligations all my life. I've a sort of morbid pride that hates\r\nthe thought of owing anything to anybody, of getting anything that\r\nI have not earned. By and by, if I were to marry you, a little\r\nrotten speck of doubt would begin to eat its way farther and\r\nfarther into me. It would be the same with you. We should react on\r\neach other. We should be watching each other, testing each other,\r\ntrying each other out all the time. It would be horrible,\r\nhorrible!'\r\n\r\nHe started to speak; then, borne down by the hopelessness of it,\r\nstopped. Elizabeth stood up. They did not look at each other. He\r\nstrapped the suitcase and picked it up. The end of all things was\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\n'Better to end it all cleanly, Bill,' she said, in a low voice.\r\n'It will hurt less.'\r\n\r\nHe did not speak.\r\n\r\n'I'll come down to the gate with you.'\r\n\r\nThey walked in silence down the drive. The air was heavy with the torpor\r\nof late summer. The sun beat down on them, turning her hair to burnished\r\ngold.  They reached the gate.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, Bill, dear.'\r\n\r\nHe took her hand dully.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye,' he said.\r\n\r\nElizabeth stood at the gate, watching. He swung down the road with\r\nlong strides. At the bend he turned and for a moment stood there,\r\nas if waiting for her to make some sign. Then he fell into his\r\nstride again and was gone. Elizabeth leaned on the gate. Her face\r\nwas twisted, and she clutched the warm wood as if it gave her\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe grounds were very empty. The spirit of loneliness brooded on\r\nthem. Elizabeth walked slowly back to the house. Nutty was coming\r\ntowards her from the orchard.\r\n\r\n'Halloa!' said Nutty.\r\n\r\nHe was cheerful and debonair. His little eyes were alight with\r\ncontentment. He hummed a tune.\r\n\r\n'Where's Dawlish?' he said.\r\n\r\n'He has gone.'\r\n\r\nNutty's tune failed in the middle of a bar. Something in his\r\nsister's voice startled him. The glow of contentment gave way to a\r\nlook of alarm.\r\n\r\n'Gone? How do you mean--gone? You don't mean--gone?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Gone away?'\r\n\r\n'Gone away.'\r\n\r\nThey had reached the house before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n'You don't mean--gone away?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Do you mean--gone away?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'You aren't going to marry him?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\nThe world stood still. The noise of the crickets and all the\r\nlittle sounds of summer smote on Nutty's ear in one discordant\r\nshriek.\r\n\r\n'Oh, gosh!' he exclaimed, faintly, and collapsed on the front\r\nsteps like a jelly-fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of Nutty in his anguish did not touch Elizabeth.\r\nNormally a kind-hearted girl, she was not in the least sorry for\r\nhim. She had even taken a bitter pleasure and found a momentary\r\nrelief in loosing the thunderbolt which had smitten him down. Even\r\nif it has to manufacture it, misery loves company. She watched\r\nNutty with a cold and uninterested eye as he opened his mouth\r\nfeebly, shut it again and reopened it; and then when it became\r\napparent that these manoeuvres were about to result in speech, she\r\nleft him and walked quickly down the drive again. She had the\r\nfeeling that if Nutty were to begin to ask her questions--and he\r\nhad the aspect of one who is about to ask a thousand--she would\r\nbreak down. She wanted solitude and movement, so she left Nutty\r\nsitting and started for the gate. Presently she would go and do\r\nthings among the beehives; and after that, if that brought no\r\nsolace, she would go in and turn the house upside down and get\r\ndusty and tired. Anything to occupy herself.\r\n\r\nReaction had set in. She had known it would come, and had made\r\nready to fight against it, but she had underestimated the strength\r\nof the enemy. It seemed to her, in those first minutes, that she\r\nhad done a mad thing; that all those arguments which she had used\r\nwere far-fetched and ridiculous. It was useless to tell herself\r\nthat she had thought the whole thing out clearly and had taken the\r\nonly course that could have been taken. With Bill's departure the\r\npower to face the situation steadily had left her. All she could\r\nthink of was that she loved him and that she had sent him away.\r\n\r\nWhy had he listened to her? Why hadn't he taken her in his arms\r\nand told her not to be a little fool? Why did men ever listen to\r\nwomen? If he had really loved her, would he have gone away? She\r\ntormented herself with this last question for a while. She was\r\nstill tormenting herself with it when a melancholy voice broke in\r\non her meditations.\r\n\r\n'I can't believe it,' said the voice. She turned, to perceive\r\nNutty drooping beside her. 'I simply can't believe it!'\r\n\r\nElizabeth clenched her teeth. She was not in the mood for Nutty.\r\n\r\n'It will gradually sink in,' she said, unsympathetically.\r\n\r\n'Did you really send him away?'\r\n\r\n'I did.'\r\n\r\n'But what on earth for?'\r\n\r\n'Because it was the only thing to do.'\r\n\r\nA light shone on Nutty's darkness.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say, did he hear what I said last night?'\r\n\r\n'He did hear what you said last night.'\r\n\r\nNutty's mouth opened slowly.\r\n\r\n'Oh!'\r\n\r\nElizabeth said nothing.\r\n\r\n'But you could have explained that.'\r\n\r\n'How?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know--somehow or other.' He appeared to think. 'But\r\nyou said it was you who sent him away.'\r\n\r\n'I did.'\r\n\r\n'Well, this beats me!'\r\n\r\nElizabeth's strained patience reached the limit.\r\n\r\n'Nutty, please!' she said. 'Don't let's talk about it. It's all\r\nover now.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but--'\r\n\r\n'Nutty, don't! I can't stand it. I'm raw all over. I'm hating\r\nmyself. Please don't make it worse.'\r\n\r\nNutty looked at her face, and decided not to make it worse. But\r\nhis anguish demanded some outlet. He found it in soliloquy.\r\n\r\n'Just like this for the rest of our lives!' he murmured, taking in\r\nthe farm-grounds and all that in them stood with one glassy stare\r\nof misery. 'Nothing but ghastly bees and sweeping floors and\r\nfetching water till we die of old age! That is, if those blighters\r\ndon't put me in jail for getting that money out of them. How was I\r\nto know that it was obtaining money under false pretences? It\r\nsimply seemed to me a darned good way of collecting a few dollars.\r\nI don't see how I'm ever going to pay them back, so I suppose it's\r\nprison for me all right.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth had been trying not to listen to him, but without\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n'I'll look after that, Nutty. I have a little money saved up,\r\nenough to pay off what you owe. I was saving it for something\r\nelse, but never mind.'\r\n\r\n'Awfully good of you,' said Nutty, but his voice sounded almost\r\ndisappointed. He was in the frame of mind which resents alleviation\r\nof its gloom. He would have preferred at that moment to be allowed to\r\nround off the picture of the future which he was constructing in his\r\nmind with a reel or two showing himself brooding in a cell. After\r\nall, what difference did it make to a man of spacious tastes whether\r\nhe languished for the rest of his life in a jail or on a farm in the\r\ncountry? Jail, indeed, was almost preferable. You knew where you were\r\nwhen you were in prison. They didn't spring things on you. Whereas\r\nlife on a farm was nothing but one long succession of things sprung\r\non you. Now that Lord Dawlish had gone, he supposed that Elizabeth\r\nwould make him help her with the bees again. At this thought he\r\ngroaned aloud. When he contemplated a lifetime at Flack's, a lifetime\r\nof bee-dodging and carpet-beating and water-lugging, and reflected\r\nthat, but for a few innocent words--words spoken, mark you, in a pure\r\nspirit of kindliness and brotherly love with the object of putting a\r\nbit of optimistic pep into sister!--he might have been in a position\r\nto touch a millionaire brother-in-law for the needful whenever he\r\nfelt disposed, the iron entered into Nutty's soul. A rotten, rotten\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nNutty had the sort of mind that moves in circles. After contemplating\r\nfor a time the rottenness of the world, he came back to the point\r\nfrom which he had started.\r\n\r\n'I can't understand it,' he said. 'I can't believe it.'\r\n\r\nHe kicked a small pebble that lay convenient to his foot.\r\n\r\n'You say you sent him away. If he had legged it on his own\r\naccount, because of what he heard me say, I could understand that.\r\nBut why should you--'\r\n\r\nIt became evident to Elizabeth that, until some explanation of\r\nthis point was offered to him, Nutty would drift about in her\r\nvicinity, moaning and shuffling his feet indefinitely.\r\n\r\n'I sent him away because I loved him,' she said, 'and because,\r\nafter what had happened, he could never be certain that I loved\r\nhim. Can you understand that?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Nutty, frankly, 'I'm darned if I can! It sounds loony\r\nto me.'\r\n\r\n'You can't see that it wouldn't have been fair to him to marry\r\nhim?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\nThe doubts which she was trying to crush increased the violence of\r\ntheir attack. It was not that she respected Nutty's judgement in\r\nitself. It was that his view of what she had done chimed in so\r\nneatly with her own. She longed for someone to tell her that she\r\nhad done right: someone who would bring back that feeling of\r\ncertainty which she had had during her talk with Bill. And in\r\nthese circumstances Nutty's attitude had more weight than on its\r\nmerits it deserved. She wished she could cry. She had a feeling\r\nthat if she once did that the right outlook would come back to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNutty, meanwhile, had found another pebble and was kicking it\r\nsombrely. He was beginning to perceive something of the intricate\r\nand unfathomable workings of the feminine mind. He had always\r\nlooked on Elizabeth as an ordinary good fellow, a girl whose mind\r\nworked in a more or less understandable way. She was not one of\r\nthose hysterical women you read about in the works of the\r\nnovelists; she was just a regular girl. And yet now, at the one\r\nmoment of her life when everything depended on her acting\r\nsensibly, she had behaved in a way that made his head swim when he\r\nthought of it. What it amounted to was that you simply couldn't\r\nunderstand women.\r\n\r\nInto this tangle of silent sorrow came a hooting automobile. It\r\ndrew up at the gate and a man jumped out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who had alighted from the automobile was young and\r\ncheerful. He wore a flannel suit of a gay blue and a straw hat\r\nwith a coloured ribbon, and he looked upon a world which, his\r\nmanner seemed to indicate, had been constructed according to his\r\nown specifications through a single eyeglass. When he spoke it\r\nbecame plain that his nationality was English.\r\n\r\nNutty regarded his beaming countenance with a lowering hostility.\r\nThe indecency of anyone being cheerful at such a time struck him\r\nforcibly. He would have liked mankind to have preserved till\r\nfurther notice a hushed gloom. He glared at the young man.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, such was her absorption in her thoughts, was not even\r\naware of his presence till he spoke to her.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon, is this Flack's?'\r\n\r\nShe looked up and met that sunny eyeglass.\r\n\r\n'This is Flack's,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said the young man.\r\n\r\nThe automobile, a stout, silent man at the helm, throbbed in the\r\nnervous way automobiles have when standing still, suggesting\r\nsomehow that it were best to talk quick, as they can give you only\r\na few minutes before dashing on to keep some other appointment.\r\nEither this or a natural volatility lent a breezy rapidity to the\r\nvisitor's speech. He looked at Elizabeth across the gate, which it\r\nhad not occurred to her to open, as if she were just what he had\r\nexpected her to be and a delight to his eyes, and burst into\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n'My name's Nichols--J. Nichols. I expect you remember getting a\r\nletter from me a week or two ago?'\r\n\r\nThe name struck Elizabeth as familiar. But he had gone on to\r\nidentify himself before she could place it in her mind.\r\n\r\n'Lawyer, don't you know. Wrote you a letter telling you that your\r\nUncle Ira Nutcombe had left all his money to Lord Dawlish.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes,' said Elizabeth, and was about to invite him to pass the\r\nbarrier, when he began to speak again.\r\n\r\n'You know, I want to explain that letter. Wrote it on a sudden\r\nimpulse, don't you know. The more I have to do with the law, the\r\nmore it seems to hit me that a lawyer oughtn't to act on impulse.\r\nAt the moment, you see, it seemed to me the decent thing to do--put\r\nyou out of your misery, and so forth--stop your entertaining\r\nhopes never to be realized, what? and all that sort of thing. You\r\nsee, it was like this: Bill--I mean Lord Dawlish--is a great pal\r\nof mine, a dear old chap. You ought to know him. Well, being in\r\nthe know, you understand, through your uncle having deposited the\r\nwill with us, I gave Bill the tip directly I heard of Mr\r\nNutcombe's death. I sent him a telephone message to come to the\r\noffice, and I said: \"Bill, old man, this old buster\"--I beg your\r\npardon, this old gentleman--\"has left you all his money.\" Quite\r\ninformal, don't you know, and at the same time, in the same\r\ninformal spirit, I wrote you the letter.' He dammed the torrent\r\nfor a moment. 'By the way, of course you are Miss Elizabeth Boyd,\r\nwhat?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nThe young man seemed relieved.\r\n\r\n'I'm glad of that,' he said. 'Funny if you hadn't been. You'd have\r\nwondered what on earth I was talking about.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of her identity, this was precisely what Elizabeth was\r\ndoing. Her mind, still under a cloud, had been unable to\r\nunderstand one word of Mr Nichols's discourse. Judging from his\r\nappearance, which was that of a bewildered hosepipe or a snake\r\nwhose brain is being momentarily overtaxed, Nutty was in the same\r\ndifficulty. He had joined the group at the gate, abandoning the\r\npebble which he had been kicking in the background, and was now\r\nleaning on the top bar, a picture of silent perplexity.\r\n\r\n'You see, the trouble is,' resumed the young man, 'my governor,\r\nwho's the head of the firm, is all for doing things according to\r\nprecedent. He loves red tape--wears it wrapped round him in winter\r\ninstead of flannel. He's all for doing things in the proper legal\r\nway, which, as I dare say you know, takes months. And, meanwhile,\r\neverybody's wondering what's happening and who has got the money,\r\nand so on and so forth. I thought I would skip all that and let\r\nyou know right away exactly where you stood, so I wrote you that\r\nletter. I don't think my temperament's quite suited to the law,\r\ndon't you know, and if he ever hears that I wrote you that letter\r\nI have a notion that the governor will think so too. So I came\r\nover here to ask you, if you don't mind, not to mention it when\r\nyou get in touch with the governor. I frankly admit that that\r\nletter, written with the best intentions, was a bloomer.'\r\n\r\nWith which manly admission the young man paused, and allowed the\r\nrays of his eyeglass to play upon Elizabeth in silence. Elizabeth\r\ntried to piece together what little she understood of his\r\nmonologue.\r\n\r\n'You mean that you want me not to tell your father that I got a\r\nletter from you?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly that. And thanks very much for not saying \"without\r\nprejudice,\" or anything of that kind. The governor would have.'\r\n\r\n'But I don't understand. Why should you think that I should ever\r\nmention anything to your father?'\r\n\r\n'Might slip out, you know, without your meaning it.'\r\n\r\n'But when? I shall never meet your father.'\r\n\r\n'You might quite easily. He might want to see you about the\r\nmoney.'\r\n\r\n'The money?'\r\n\r\nThe eyebrow above the eyeglass rose, surprised.\r\n\r\n'Haven't you had a letter from the governor?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\nThe young man made a despairing gesture.\r\n\r\n'I took it for granted that it had come on the same boat that I\r\ndid. There you have the governor's methods! Couldn't want a better\r\nexample. I suppose some legal formality or other has cropped up\r\nand laid him a stymie, and he's waiting to get round it. You\r\nreally mean he hasn't written?\r\n\r\n'Why, dash it,' said the young man, as one to whom all is\r\nrevealed, 'then you can't have understood a word of what I've been\r\nsaying!'\r\n\r\nFor the first time Elizabeth found herself capable of smiling. She\r\nliked this incoherent young man.\r\n\r\n'I haven't,' she said.\r\n\r\n'You don't know about the will?'\r\n\r\n'Only what you told me in your letter.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm hanged! Tell me--I hadn't the honour of knowing him\r\npersonally--was the late Mr Nutcombe's whole life as eccentric as\r\nhis will-making? It seems to me--'\r\n\r\nNutty spoke.\r\n\r\n'Uncle Ira's middle name,' he said, 'was Bloomingdale. That,' he\r\nproceeded, bitterly, 'is the frightful injustice of it all. I had\r\nto suffer from it right along, and all I get, when it comes to a\r\nfinish, is a miserable hundred dollars. Uncle Ira insisted on\r\nfather and mother calling me Nutcombe; and whenever he got a new\r\ncraze I was always the one he worked it off on. You remember the\r\ntime he became a vegetarian, Elizabeth? Gosh!' Nutty brooded\r\ncoldly on the past. 'You remember the time he had it all worked\r\nout that the end of the world was to come at five in the morning\r\none February? Made me stop up all night with him, reading Marcus\r\nAurelius! And the steam-heat turned off at twelve-thirty! I could\r\ntell you a dozen things just as bad as that. He always picked on\r\nme. And now I've gone through it all he leaves me a hundred\r\ndollars!'\r\n\r\nMr Nichols nodded sympathetically.\r\n\r\n'I should have imagined that he was rather like that. You know, of\r\ncourse, why he made that will I wrote to you about, leaving all\r\nhis money to Bill Dawlish? Simply because Bill, who met him\r\ngolfing at a place in Cornwall in the off season, cured him of\r\nslicing his approach-shots! I give you my word that was the only\r\nreason. I'm sorry for old Bill, poor old chap. Such a good sort!'\r\n\r\n'He's all right,' said Nutty. 'But why you should be sorry for him\r\ngets past me. A fellow who gets five million--'\r\n\r\n'But he doesn't, don't you see?'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Why, this other will puts him out of the running.'\r\n\r\n'Which other will?'\r\n\r\n'Why, the one I'm telling you about.'\r\n\r\nHe looked from one to the other, apparently astonished at their\r\nslowness of understanding. Then an idea occurred to him.\r\n\r\n'Why, now that I think of it, I never told you, did I? Yes, your\r\nuncle made another will at the very last moment, leaving all he\r\npossessed to Miss Boyd.'\r\n\r\nThe dead silence in which his words were received stimulated him\r\nto further speech. It occurred to him that, after that letter of\r\nhis, perhaps these people were wary about believing anything he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n'It's absolutely true. It's the real, stable information this\r\ntime. I had it direct from the governor, who was there when he\r\nmade the will. He and the governor had had a row about something,\r\nyou know, and they made it up during those last days, and--Well,\r\napparently your uncle thought he had better celebrate it somehow,\r\nso he made a new will. From what little I know of him, that was\r\nthe way he celebrated most things. I took it for granted the\r\ngovernor would have written to you by this time. I expect you'll\r\nhear by the next mail. You see, what brought me over was the idea\r\nthat when he wrote you might possibly take it into your heads to\r\nmention having heard from me. You don't know my governor. If he\r\nfound out I had done that I should never hear the last of it. So I\r\nsaid to him: \"Gov'nor, I'm feeling a bit jaded. Been working too\r\nhard, or something. I'll take a week or so off, if you can spare\r\nme.\" He didn't object, so I whizzed over. Well, of course, I'm\r\nawfully sorry for old Bill, but I congratulate you, Miss Boyd.'\r\n\r\n'What's the time?' said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMr Nichols was surprised. He could not detect the connexion of\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n'It's about five to eleven,' he said, consulting his watch.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he was even more surprised, for Elizabeth, making\r\nnothing of the barrier of the gate, had rushed past him and was\r\neven now climbing into his automobile.\r\n\r\n'Take me to the station, at once,' she was crying to the stout,\r\nsilent man, whom not even these surprising happenings had shaken\r\nfrom his attitude of well-fed detachment.\r\n\r\nThe stout man, ceasing to be silent, became interrogative.\r\n\r\n'Uh?'\r\n\r\n'Take me to the station. I must catch the eleven o'clock train.'\r\n\r\nThe stout man was not a rapid thinker. He enveloped her in a\r\nstodgy gaze. It was only too plain to Elizabeth that he was a man\r\nwho liked to digest one idea slowly before going on to absorb the\r\nnext. Jerry Nichols had told him to drive to Flack's. He had\r\ndriven to Flack's. Here he was at Flack's. Now this young woman\r\nwas telling him to drive to the station. It was a new idea, and he\r\nbent himself to the Fletcherizing of it.\r\n\r\n'I'll give you ten dollars if you get me there by eleven,' shouted\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe car started as if it were some living thing that had had a\r\nsharp instrument jabbed into it. Once or twice in his life it had\r\nhappened to the stout man to encounter an idea which he could\r\nswallow at a gulp. This was one of them.\r\n\r\nMr Nichols, following the car with a wondering eye, found that\r\nNutty was addressing him.\r\n\r\n'Is this really true?' said Nutty.\r\n\r\n'Absolute gospel.'\r\n\r\nA wild cry, a piercing whoop of pure joy, broke the summer\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\n'Come and have a drink, old man!' babbled Nutty. 'This wants\r\ncelebrating!' His face fell. 'Oh, I was forgetting! I'm on the\r\nwagon.'\r\n\r\n'On the wagon?'\r\n\r\n'Sworn off, you know. I'm never going to touch another drop as\r\nlong as I live. I began to see things--monkeys!'\r\n\r\n'I had a pal,' said Mr Nichols, sympathetically, 'who used to see\r\nkangaroos.'\r\n\r\nNutty seized him by the arm, hospitable though handicapped.\r\n\r\n'Come and have a bit of bread and butter, or a slice of cake or\r\nsomething, and a glass of water. I want to tell you a lot more\r\nabout Uncle Ira, and I want to hear all about your end of it. Gee,\r\nwhat a day!'\r\n\r\n'\"The maddest, merriest of all the glad New Year,\"' assented Mr\r\nNichols. 'A slice of that old 'eighty-seven cake. Just the thing!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n\r\nBill made his way along the swaying train to the smoking-car,\r\nwhich was almost empty. It had come upon him overwhelmingly that\r\nhe needed tobacco. He was in the mood when a man must either smoke\r\nor give up altogether the struggle with Fate. He lit his pipe, and\r\nlooked out of the window at Long Island racing past him. It was\r\nonly a blur to him.\r\n\r\nThe conductor was asking for tickets. Bill showed his mechanically,\r\nand the conductor passed on. Then he settled down once more to his\r\nthoughts. He could not think coherently yet. His walk to the station\r\nhad been like a walk in a dream. He was conscious of a great, dull\r\npain that weighed on his mind, smothering it. The trees and houses\r\nstill moved past him in the same indistinguishable blur.\r\n\r\nHe became aware that the conductor was standing beside him, saying\r\nsomething about a ticket. He produced his once more, but this did\r\nnot seem to satisfy the conductor. To get rid of the man, who was\r\nbecoming a nuisance, he gave him his whole attention, as far as\r\nthat smothering weight would allow him to give his whole attention\r\nto anything, and found that the man was saying strange things. He\r\nthought that he could not have heard him correctly.\r\n\r\n'What?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Lady back there told me to collect her fare from you,' repeated\r\nthe conductor. 'Said you would pay.'\r\n\r\nBill blinked. Either there was some mistake or trouble had turned\r\nhis brain. He pushed himself together with a supreme effort.\r\n\r\n'A lady said I would pay her fare?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'But--but why?' demanded Bill, feebly.\r\n\r\nThe conductor seemed unwilling to go into first causes.\r\n\r\n'Search me!' he replied.\r\n\r\n'Pay her fare!'\r\n\r\n'Told me to collect it off the gentleman in the grey suit in the\r\nsmoking-car. You're the only one that's got a grey suit.'\r\n\r\n'There's some mistake.'\r\n\r\n'Not mine.'\r\n\r\n'What does she look like?'\r\n\r\nThe conductor delved in his mind for adjectives.\r\n\r\n'Small,' he said, collecting them slowly. 'Brown eyes--'\r\n\r\nHe desisted from his cataloguing at this point, for, with a loud\r\nexclamation, Bill had dashed away.\r\n\r\nTwo cars farther back he had dropped into the seat by Elizabeth\r\nand was gurgling wordlessly. A massive lady, who had entered the\r\ntrain at East Moriches in company with three children and a cat in\r\na basket, eyed him with a curiosity that she made no attempt to\r\nconceal. Two girls in a neighbouring seat leaned forward eagerly\r\nto hear all. This was because one of them had told the other that\r\nElizabeth was Mary Pickford. Her companion was sceptical, but\r\nnevertheless obviously impressed.\r\n\r\n'My God!' said Bill.\r\n\r\nThe massive lady told the three children sharply to look at their\r\npicture-book.\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm hanged!'\r\n\r\nThe mother of three said that if her offspring did not go right\r\nalong to the end of the car and look at the pretty trees trouble\r\nmust infallibly ensue.\r\n\r\n'Elizabeth!' At the sound of the name the two girls leaned back,\r\ntaking no further interest in the proceedings.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing here?'\r\n\r\nElizabeth smiled, a shaky but encouraging smile.\r\n\r\n'I came after you, Bill.'\r\n\r\n'You've got no hat!'\r\n\r\n'I was in too much of a hurry to get one, and I gave all my money\r\nto the man who drove the car. That's why I had to ask you to pay\r\nmy fare. You see, I'm not too proud to use your money after all.'\r\n\r\n'Then--'\r\n\r\n'Tickets please. One seventy-nine.'\r\n\r\nIt was the indefatigable conductor, sensible of his duty to the\r\ncompany and resolved that nothing should stand in the way of its\r\nperformance. Bill gave him five dollars and told him to keep the\r\nchange. The conductor saw eye to eye with him in this.\r\n\r\n'Bill! You gave him--' She gave a little shrug of her shoulders.\r\n'Well, it's lucky you're going to marry a rich girl.'\r\n\r\nA look of the utmost determination overspread Bill's face.\r\n\r\n'I don't know what you're talking about. I'm going to marry you.\r\nNow that I've got you again I'm not going to let you go. You can\r\nuse all the arguments you like, but it won't matter. I was a fool\r\never to listen. If you try the same sort of thing again I'm just\r\ngoing to pick you up and carry you off. I've been thinking it over\r\nsince I left you. My mind has been working absolutely clearly.\r\nI've gone into the whole thing. It's perfect rot to take the\r\nattitude you did. We know we love each other, and I'm not going to\r\nlisten to any talk about time making us doubt it. Time will only\r\nmake us love each other all the more.'\r\n\r\n'Why, Bill, this is eloquence.'\r\n\r\n'I feel eloquent.'\r\n\r\nThe stout lady ceased to listen. They had lowered their voices and\r\nshe was hard of hearing. She consoled herself by taking up her\r\ncopy of Gingery Stories and burying herself in the hectic\r\nadventures of a young millionaire and an artist's model.\r\n\r\nElizabeth caught a fleeting glimpse of the cover.\r\n\r\n'I bet there's a story in there of a man named Harold who was too\r\nproud to marry a girl, though he loved her, because she was rich\r\nand he wasn't. You wouldn't be so silly as that, Bill, would you?'\r\n\r\n'It's the other way about with me.'\r\n\r\n'No, it's not. Bill, do you know a man named Nichols?'\r\n\r\n'Nichols?'\r\n\r\n'J. Nichols. He said he knew you. He said he had told you about\r\nUncle Ira leaving you his money.'\r\n\r\n'Jerry Nichols! How on earth--Oh, I remember. He wrote to you,\r\ndidn't he?'\r\n\r\n'He did. And this morning, just after you had left, he called.'\r\n\r\n'Jerry Nichols called?'\r\n\r\n'To tell me that Uncle Ira had made another will before he died,\r\nleaving the money to me.'\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met.\r\n\r\n'So I stole his car and caught the train,' said Elizabeth, simply.\r\n\r\nBill was recovering slowly from the news.\r\n\r\n'But--this makes rather a difference, you know,' he said.\r\n\r\n'In what way?'\r\n\r\n'Well, what I mean to say is, you've got five million dollars and\r\nI've got two thousand a year, don't you know, and so--'\r\n\r\nElizabeth tapped him on the knee.\r\n\r\n'Bill, do you see what this is in my hand?'\r\n\r\n'Eh? What?'\r\n\r\n'It's a pin. And I'm going to dig it right into you wherever I\r\nthink it will hurt most, unless you stop being Harold at once.\r\nI'll tell you exactly what you've got to do, and you needn't think\r\nyou're going to do anything else. When we get to New York, I first\r\nborrow the money from you to buy a hat, and then we walk to the\r\nCity Hall, where you go to the window marked \"Marriage Licences\",\r\nand buy one. It will cost you one dollar. You will give your\r\ncorrect name and age and you will hear mine. It will come as a\r\nshock to you to know that my second name is something awful! I've\r\nkept it concealed all my life. After we've done that we shall go\r\nto the only church that anybody could possibly be married in. It's\r\non Twenty-ninth Street, just round the corner from Fifth Avenue.\r\nIt's got a fountain playing in front of it, and it's a little bit\r\nof heaven dumped right down in the middle of New York. And after\r\nthat--well, we might start looking about for that farm we've\r\ntalked of. We can get a good farm for five million dollars, and\r\nleave something over to be doled out--cautiously--to Nutty.\r\n\r\n'And then all we have to do is to live happily ever after.'\r\n\r\nSomething small and soft slipped itself into his hand, just as it\r\nhad done ages and ages ago in Lady Wetherby's wood.\r\n\r\nIt stimulated Bill's conscience to one last remonstrance.\r\n\r\n'But, I say, you know--'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'This business of the money, you know. What I mean to say is--Ow!'\r\n\r\nHe broke off, as a sharp pain manifested itself in the fleshy part\r\nof his leg. Elizabeth was looking at him reprovingly, her weapon\r\npoised for another onslaught.\r\n\r\n'I told you!' she said.\r\n\r\n'All right, I won't do it again.'\r\n\r\n'That's a good child. Bill, listen. Come closer and tell me all\r\nsorts of nice things about myself till we get to Jamaica, and then\r\nI'll tell you what I think of you. We've just passed Islip, so\r\nyou've plenty of time.'"
