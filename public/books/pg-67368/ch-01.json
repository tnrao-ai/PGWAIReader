Pynsent Import and Export Company,\r\nbeing in the act of contesting the final of the Office Boys’\r\nHigh-Kicking Championship against a willowy youth from the Consolidated\r\nEyebrow Tweezer and Nail File Corporation. The affair was taking place\r\non the premises of a few stenographers, chewing gum; some male wage\r\nslaves in shirt sleeves; and Mr. John B. Pynsent’s nephew, Samuel\r\nShotter, a young man of agreeable features, who was acting as referee.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being referee, Sam Shotter was also the patron and\r\npromoter of the tourney; the man but for whose vision and enterprise a\r\nwealth of young talent would have lain undeveloped, thereby jeopardising\r\nAmerica’s chances should an event of this kind ever be added to the\r\nprogram of the Olympic Games. It was he who, wandering about the office\r\nin a restless search for methods of sweetening an uncongenial round of\r\ntoil, had come upon Master Murphy practicing kicks against the wall of a\r\nremote corridor and had encouraged him to kick higher. It was he who had\r\narranged matches with representatives of other firms throughout the\r\nbuilding. And it was he who out of his own pocket had provided the purse\r\nwhich, as the lad’s foot crashed against the plaster a full inch above\r\nhis rival’s best effort, he now handed to Spike together with a few\r\nwell-chosen words.\r\n\r\n“Murphy,” said Sam, “is the winner. After a contest conducted throughout\r\nin accordance with the best traditions of American high kicking, he has\r\nupheld the honour of the John B. Pynsent Ex and Imp and retained his\r\ntitle. In the absence of the boss, therefore, who has unfortunately been\r\ncalled away to Philadelphia and so is unable to preside at this meeting,\r\nI take much pleasure in presenting him with the guerdon of victory, this\r\nhandsome dollar bill. Take it, Spike, and in after years, when you are a\r\ngrey-haired alderman or something, look back to this moment and say to\r\nyourself----”\r\n\r\nSam stopped, a little hurt. He thought he had been speaking rather well,\r\nyet already his audience was walking out on him. Spike Murphy, indeed,\r\nwas running.\r\n\r\n“Say to yourself----”\r\n\r\n“When you are at leisure, Samuel,” observed a voice behind him, “I\r\nshould be glad of a word with you in my office.”\r\n\r\nSam turned.\r\n\r\n“Oh, hullo, uncle,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe coughed; Mr. Pynsent coughed.\r\n\r\n“I thought you had gone to Philadelphia,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Mr. Pynsent.\r\n\r\nHe made no further remark, but proceeded sedately to his room, from\r\nwhich he emerged again a moment later with a patient look of inquiry on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“Come here, Sam,” he said. “Who,” he asked, pointing, “is this?”\r\n\r\nSam peeped through the doorway and perceived, tilted back in a swivel\r\nchair, a long, lean man of repellent aspect. His large feet rested\r\ncomfortably on the desk, his head hung sideways and his mouth was open.\r\nFrom his mouth, which was of generous proportions, there came a gurgling\r\nsnore.\r\n\r\n“Who,” repeated Mr. Pynsent, “is this gentleman?”\r\n\r\nSam could not help admiring his uncle’s unerring instinct--that amazing\r\nintuition which had led him straight to the realisation that if an\r\nuninvited stranger was slumbering in his pet chair, the responsibility\r\nmust of necessity be his nephew Samuel’s.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” he exclaimed. “I didn’t know he was there.”\r\n\r\n“A friend of yours?”\r\n\r\n“It’s Hash.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“Hash Todhunter, you know, the cook of the _Araminta_. You remember I\r\ntook a trip a year ago on a tramp steamer? This fellow was the cook. I\r\nmet him on Broadway this afternoon and gave him lunch. I brought him\r\nback here because he wanted to see the place where I work.”\r\n\r\n“Work?” said Mr. Pynsent, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“I had no notion he had strayed into your room.”\r\n\r\nSam spoke apologetically, but he would have liked to point out that the\r\nblame for all these embarrassing occurrences was really Mr. Pynsent’s.\r\nIf a man creates the impression that he is going to Philadelphia and\r\nthen does not go, he has only himself to thank for any complications\r\nthat may ensue. However, this was a technicality with which he did not\r\nbother his uncle.\r\n\r\n“Shall I wake him?”\r\n\r\n“If you would be so good. And having done so, take him away and store\r\nhim somewhere and then come back. I have much to say to you.”\r\n\r\nShaken by a vigorous hand, the sleeper opened his eyes. Hauled to his\r\nfeet, he permitted himself to be led, still in a trancelike condition,\r\nout of the room and down the passage to the cubbyhole where Sam\r\nperformed his daily duties. Here, sinking into a chair, he fell asleep\r\nagain; and Sam left him and went back to his uncle. Mr. Pynsent was\r\nstaring thoughtfully out of the window as he entered.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Sam,” he said.\r\n\r\nSam sat down.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry about all that, uncle.”\r\n\r\n“All what?”\r\n\r\n“All that business that was going on when you came in.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes. What was it, by the way?”\r\n\r\n“Spike Murphy was seeing if he could kick higher than a kid from a firm\r\ndownstairs.”\r\n\r\n“And did he?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Good boy,” said Mr. Pynsent approvingly. “You arranged the competition,\r\nno doubt?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.”\r\n\r\n“You would. You have been in my employment,” proceeded Mr. Pynsent\r\nevenly, “three months. In that time you have succeeded in thoroughly\r\ndemoralising the finest office force in New York.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, uncle!” said Sam reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“Thoroughly,” repeated Mr. Pynsent. “The office boys call you by your\r\nChristian name.”\r\n\r\n“They will do it,” sighed Sam. “I clump their heads, but the habit\r\npersists.”\r\n\r\n“Last Wednesday I observed you kissing my stenographer.”\r\n\r\n“The poor little thing had toothache.”\r\n\r\n“Also, Mr. Ellaby informs me that your work is a disgrace to the firm.”\r\nThere was a pause. “The English public school is the curse of the age,”\r\nsaid Mr. Pynsent dreamily.\r\n\r\nTo a stranger the remark might have sounded irrelevant, but Sam\r\nunderstood the import. He appreciated it for what it was--a nasty crack.\r\n\r\n“Did they teach you anything at Wrykyn, Sam, except football?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, lots of things.”\r\n\r\n“I have seen no evidence of it. Why your mother sent you to that place,\r\ninstead of to some good business college, I cannot imagine.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, father had been there----”\r\n\r\nSam broke off. Mr. Pynsent, he was aware, had not been fond of the late\r\nAnthony Shotter--considering, and possibly correctly, that his dead\r\nsister had, in marrying that amiable but erratic person, been guilty of\r\nthe crowning folly of a frivolous and fluffy-headed life.\r\n\r\n“A strong recommendation,” said Mr. Pynsent dryly.\r\n\r\nSam had nothing to say to this.\r\n\r\n“You are very like your father in a great many ways,” said Mr. Pynsent.\r\n\r\nSam let this one go by too. They were coming off the bat a bit fast this\r\nmorning, but there was nothing to be done about it.\r\n\r\n“And yet I am fond of you, Sam,” resumed Mr. Pynsent after a brief\r\npause.\r\n\r\nThis was more the stuff.\r\n\r\n“And I am fond of you, uncle,” said Sam in a hearty voice. “When I think\r\nof all you have done for me----”\r\n\r\n“But,” went on Mr. Pynsent, “I feel that I shall like you even better\r\nthree thousand miles away from the offices of the Pynsent Export and\r\nImport Company. We are parting, Sam--and immediately.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\n“I, on the other hand,” said Mr. Pynsent, “am glad.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Sam, feeling that the interview, having reached\r\nthis point, might be considered over, got up.\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment,” said Mr. Pynsent. “I want to tell you what plans I have\r\nmade for your future.”\r\n\r\nSam was agreeably surprised. He had not supposed that his future would\r\nbe of interest to Mr. Pynsent.\r\n\r\n“Have you made plans?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; everything is settled.”\r\n\r\n“This is fine, uncle,” said Sam cordially. “I thought you were going to\r\ndrive me out into the snow.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember meeting an Englishman named Lord Tilbury at dinner at\r\nmy house?”\r\n\r\nSam did indeed. His Lordship had got him wedged into a corner after the\r\nmeal and had talked without a pause for more than half an hour.\r\n\r\n“He is the proprietor of the Mammoth Publishing Company, a concern which\r\nproduces a great many daily and weekly papers in London.”\r\n\r\nSam was aware of this. Lord Tilbury’s conversation had been almost\r\nentirely autobiographical.\r\n\r\n“Well, he is returning to England on Saturday on the _Mauretania_, and\r\nyou are going with him.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“He has offered to employ you in his business.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know anything about newspaper work.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know anything about anything,” Mr. Pynsent pointed out\r\ngently. “It is the effect of your English public-school education.\r\nHowever, you certainly cannot be a greater failure with Lord Tilbury\r\nthan you have been with me. That wastepaper basket over there has been\r\nin my office only four days, and already it knows more about the export\r\nand import business than you would learn if you stayed here fifty\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\nSam made plaintive noises. Fifty years, he considered, was an\r\noverstatement.\r\n\r\n“I concealed nothing of this from Lord Tilbury, but nevertheless he\r\ninsists on engaging you.”\r\n\r\n“Odd,” said Sam. He could not help feeling a little flattered at this\r\nintense desire for his services on the part of a man who had met him\r\nonly once. Lord Tilbury might be a bore, but there was no getting away\r\nfrom the fact that he had that gift without which no one can amass a\r\nlarge fortune--that strange, almost uncanny gift for spotting the good\r\nman when he saw him.\r\n\r\n“Not at all odd,” said Mr. Pynsent. “He and I are in the middle of a\r\nbusiness deal. He is trying to persuade me to do something which at\r\npresent I have not made up my mind to do. He thinks that by taking you\r\noff my hands he will put me under an obligation. So he will.”\r\n\r\n“Uncle,” said Sam impressively, “I will make good.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better,” returned Mr. Pynsent, unmelted. “It is your last\r\nchance. There is no earthly reason why I should go on supporting you for\r\nthe rest of your life, and I do not intend to do it. If you make a mess\r\nof things at Tilbury House, don’t think that you can come running back\r\nto me. There will be no fatted calf. Remember that.”\r\n\r\n“I will, uncle, I will. But don’t worry. Something tells me I am going\r\nto be good. I shall like going to England.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear that. Well, that is all. Good afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“You know, it’s rather strange that you should be sending me over\r\nthere,” said Sam meditatively.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so. I am glad to have the chance.”\r\n\r\n“What I mean is--do you believe in palmists?”\r\n\r\n“I do not. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Because a palmist told me----”\r\n\r\n“The door,” said Mr. Pynsent, “is one of those which close automatically\r\nwhen the handle is released.”\r\n\r\nHaving tested this statement and proved it correct, Sam went back to his\r\nown quarters, where he found Mr. Clarence (Hash) Todhunter, the popular\r\nand energetic chef of the tramp steamer _Araminta_, awake and smoking a\r\nshort pipe.\r\n\r\n“Who was the old boy?” inquired Mr. Todhunter.\r\n\r\n“That was my uncle, the head of the firm.”\r\n\r\n“Did I go to sleep in his room?”\r\n\r\n“You did.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry about that, Sam,” said Hash, with manly regret. “I had a late\r\nnight last night.”\r\n\r\nHe yawned spaciously. Hash Todhunter was a lean, stringy man in the\r\nearly thirties, with a high forehead and a ruminative eye. Irritated\r\nmessmates who had played poker with him had sometimes compared this eye\r\nto that of a perishing fish; but to the critic whose judgment was not\r\nbiased and inflamed by recent pecuniary losses it would have been more\r\nsuggestive of a parrot which has looked on life and found it full of\r\ndisillusionment. There was a strong pessimistic streak in Hash, and in\r\nhis cups he was accustomed to hint darkly that if everyone had their\r\nrights he would have been in the direct line of succession to an\r\nearldom. It was a long and involved story, casting great discredit on\r\nall the parties concerned; but as he never told it twice in the same\r\nway, little credence was accorded to it by a discriminating fo’c’sle.\r\nFor the rest, he cooked the best dry hash on the Western Ocean, but was\r\nnot proud.\r\n\r\n“Hash,” said Sam, “I’m going over to England.”\r\n\r\n“Me too. We sail Monday.”\r\n\r\n“Do you, by Jove!” said Sam thoughtfully. “I’m supposed to be going on\r\nthe _Mauretania_ on Saturday, but I’ve half a mind to come with you\r\ninstead. I don’t like the idea of six days _tête-à-tête_ with Lord\r\nTilbury.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s he?”\r\n\r\n“The proprietor of the Mammoth Publishing Company, where I am going to\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“Have you got the push here then?”\r\n\r\nIt piqued Sam a little that this untutored man should so readily have\r\ndivined the facts. He also considered that Hash had failed in tact. He\r\nmight at least have pretended that he supposed it to be a case of\r\nhanding in a resignation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you might perhaps put it that way.”\r\n\r\n“Not because of me sittin’ in his chair?”\r\n\r\n“No. There are, apparently, a number of reasons. Hash, it’s a curious\r\nthing, my uncle taking it into his head to shoot me over to England like\r\nthis. The other day a palmist told me that I was shortly going to take a\r\nlong journey, at the end of which I should meet a fair girl.... Hash!”\r\n\r\n“Ur?”\r\n\r\n“I want to show you something.”\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his pocket and produced a note-case. Having done this, he\r\npaused. Then, seeming to overcome a momentary hesitation, he opened the\r\ncase and from it, with the delicacy of an Indian priest at a shrine\r\nhandling a precious relic, extracted a folded piece of paper.\r\n\r\nA casual observer, deceived by a certain cheery irresponsibility that\r\nmarked his behaviour, might have set Sam Shotter down as one of those\r\nessentially material young men in whose armour romance does not easily\r\nfind a chink. He would have erred in this assumption. For all that he\r\nweighed a hundred and seventy pounds of bone and sinew and had when\r\namused--which was often--a laugh like that of the hyena in its native\r\njungle, there was sentiment in Sam. Otherwise this paper would scarcely\r\nhave been in his possession.\r\n\r\n“But before showing it to you,” he said, eying Hash intently, “I would\r\nlike to ask you a question. Do you see anything funny, anything\r\nlaughable, anything at all ludicrous, in a fellow going for a fishing\r\ntrip to Canada and being stuck in a hut miles from anywhere with nothing\r\nto read and nothing to listen to except the wild duck calling to its\r\nmate and the nifties of a French-Canadian guide who couldn’t speak more\r\nthan three words of English----”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Hash.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t finished. Do you--to proceed--see anything absurd in the fact\r\nthat such a fellow, in such a situation, finding the photograph of a\r\nbeautiful girl tacked up on the wall of the hut by some previous visitor\r\nand having nothing else to look at for five weeks, should have fallen in\r\nlove with this photograph? Think before you answer.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Hash, after consideration. He was not a man who readily\r\ndetected the humorous aspect of anything.\r\n\r\n“That’s good,” said Sam. “And lucky for you. Because had you let one\r\nsnicker out of yourself--just one--I would have smitten you rather\r\nforcibly on the beezer. Well, I did.”\r\n\r\n“Did what?”\r\n\r\n“Found this picture tacked up on the wall and fell in love with it.\r\nLook!”\r\n\r\nHe unfolded the paper reverently. It now revealed itself as a portion of\r\na page torn from one of those illustrated journals which brighten the\r\nmiddle of the Englishman’s week. Its sojourn on the wall of the fishing\r\nhut had not improved it. It was faded and yellow, and over one corner a\r\ndark stain had spread itself, seeming to indicate that some occupant of\r\nthe hut had at one time or another done a piece of careless carving.\r\nNevertheless, he gazed at it as a young knight might have gazed upon the\r\nHoly Grail.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\nHash surveyed the paper closely.\r\n\r\n“That’s mutton gravy,” he said, pointing at the stain and forming a\r\nprofessional man’s swift diagnosis. “Beef wouldn’t be so dark.”\r\n\r\nSam regarded him with a glance of concentrated loathing which would have\r\nembarrassed a more sensitive man.\r\n\r\n“I show you this lovely face, all aglow with youth and the joy of life,”\r\nhe cried, “and all that seems to interest you is that some foul vandal,\r\nwhose neck I should like to wring, has splashed his beastly dinner over\r\nit. Heavens, man, look at that girl! Have you ever seen such a girl?”\r\n\r\n“She’s not bad.”\r\n\r\n“Not bad! Can’t you see she’s simply marvellous?”\r\n\r\nThe photograph did, indeed, to a great extent justify Sam’s enthusiasm.\r\nIt represented a girl in hunting costume, standing beside her horse. She\r\nwas a trim, boyish-looking girl of about eighteen, slightly above the\r\nmedium height; and she gazed out of the picture with clear, grave,\r\nsteady eyes. At the corner of her mouth there was a little thoughtful\r\ndroop. It was a pretty mouth; but Sam, who had made a study of the\r\npicture and considered himself the world’s leading authority upon it,\r\nwas of opinion that it would look even prettier when smiling.\r\n\r\nUnder the photograph, in leaded capitals, ran the words:\r\n\r\n                      A FAIR DAUGHTER OF NIMROD.\r\n\r\nBeneath this poetical caption, it is to be presumed, there had\r\noriginally been more definite information as to the subject’s identity,\r\nbut the coarse hand which had wrenched the page from its setting had\r\nunfortunately happened to tear off the remainder of the letterpress.\r\n\r\n“Simply marvellous,” said Sam emotionally. “What’s that thing of\r\nTennyson’s about a little English rosebud, she?”\r\n\r\n“Tennyson? There was a feller when I was on the _Sea Bird_, called\r\nPennyman----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, shut up! Isn’t she a wonder, Hash! And what is more--fair, wouldn’t\r\nyou say?”\r\n\r\nHash scratched his chin. He was a man who liked to think things over.\r\n\r\n“Or dark,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Idiot! Don’t tell me those eyes aren’t blue.”\r\n\r\n“Might be,” admitted Hash grudgingly.\r\n\r\n“And that hair would be golden, or possibly a very light brown.”\r\n\r\n“How’m I to know?”\r\n\r\n“Hash,” said Sam, “the very first thing I do when I get to England is to\r\nfind out who that girl is.”\r\n\r\n“Easy enough.” Hash pointed the stem of his pipe at the caption.\r\n“Daughter of Nimrod. All you got to do is get a telephone directory and\r\nlook him up. It’ll give the address as well.”\r\n\r\n“How do you think of these things?” said Sam admiringly. “The only\r\ntrouble is, suppose old man Nimrod lives in the country. He sounds like\r\na hunting man.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Hash. “There’s that, o’ course.”\r\n\r\n“No, my best scheme will be to find out what paper this is torn out of,\r\nand then search back through the files for the picture.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe,” said Hash. He had plainly lost interest in the subject.\r\n\r\nSam was gazing dreamily at the picture.\r\n\r\n“Do you see that little dimple just by the chin, Hash? My goodness, I’d\r\ngive something to see that girl smile!” He replaced the paper in his\r\nnote-case and sighed. “Love is a wonderful thing, Hash.”\r\n\r\nMr. Todhunter’s ample mouth curled sardonically.\r\n\r\n“When you’ve seen as much of life as I have,” he replied, “you’d rather\r\nhave a cup of tea.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nKAY OF VALLEY FIELDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nameless individual who had torn from its setting the photograph\r\nwhich had so excited the admiration of Sam Shotter had, as has been\r\nalready indicated, torn untidily. Had he exercised a little more care,\r\nthat lovelorn young man would have seen beneath the picture the\r\nfollowing legend:\r\n\r\n              MISS KAY DERRICK, DAUGHTER OF COL. EUSTACE\r\n                   DERRICK, OF MIDWAYS HALL, WILTS.\r\n\r\nAnd if he had happened to be in Piccadilly Circus on a certain afternoon\r\nsome three weeks after his conversation with Hash Todhunter, he might\r\nhave observed Miss Derrick in person. For she was standing on the island\r\nthere waiting for a Number Three omnibus.\r\n\r\nHis first impression, had he so beheld her, would certainly have been\r\nthat the photograph, attractive though it was, did not do her justice.\r\nFour years had passed since it had been taken, and between the ages of\r\neighteen and twenty-two many girls gain appreciably in looks. Kay\r\nDerrick was one of them. He would then have observed that his views on\r\nher appearance had been sound. Her eyes, as he had predicted, were\r\nblue--a very dark, warm blue like the sky on a summer night--and her\r\nhair, such of it as was visible beneath a becoming little hat, was of a\r\nsoft golden brown. The third thing he would have noticed about her was\r\nthat she looked tired. And, indeed, she was. It was her daily task to\r\npresent herself at the house of a certain Mrs. Winnington-Bates in\r\nThurloe Square, South Kensington, to read to that lady and to attend to\r\nher voluminous correspondence. And nobody who knew Mrs. Winnington-Bates\r\nat all intimately would have disputed the right of any girl who did this\r\nto look as tired as she pleased.\r\n\r\nThe omnibus arrived and Kay climbed the steps to the roof. The conductor\r\npresented himself, punch in hand.\r\n\r\n“Fez, pliz.”\r\n\r\n“Valley Fields,” said Kay.\r\n\r\n“Q,” said the conductor.\r\n\r\nHe displayed no excitement as he handed her the ticket, none of that\r\nanxious concern exhibited by those who met the young man with the banner\r\nmarked Excelsior; for the days are long past when it was considered\r\nrather a dashing adventure to journey to Valley Fields. Two hundred\r\nyears ago, when highwaymen roved West Kensington and snipe were shot in\r\nRegent Street, this pleasant suburb in the Postal Division S. E. 21 was\r\na remote spot to which jaded bucks and beaux would ride when they wanted\r\nto get really close to Nature. But now that vast lake of brick and\r\nasphalt which is London has flooded its banks and engulfed it. The\r\nValley Fields of to-day is a mass of houses, and you may reach it not\r\nonly by omnibus but by train, and even by tram.\r\n\r\nIt was a place very familiar to Kay now, so that at times she seemed to\r\nhave been there all her life; and yet actually only a few months had\r\nelapsed since she had been washed up on its shores like a piece of\r\nflotsam; or, to put the facts with less imagery, since Mr. Wrenn, of San\r\nRafael, Burberry Road, had come forward on the death of her parents and\r\noffered her a home there. This Mr. Wrenn being the bad Uncle Matthew who\r\nin the dim past--somewhere around the year 1905--splashed a hideous blot\r\non the Derrick escutcheon by eloping with Kay’s Aunt Enid.\r\n\r\nKay had been a child of two at the time, and it was not till she was\r\neight that she heard the story, her informant being young Willoughby\r\nBraddock, the stout boy who, with the aid of a trustee, owned the great\r\nhouse and estates adjoining Midways. It was a romantic story--of a young\r\nman who had come down to do Midways for the Stately-Homes-of-England\r\nseries appearing in the then newly established Pyke’s _Home Companion_;\r\nwho in the process of doing it had made the acquaintance of the sister\r\nof its owner; and who only a few weeks later had induced her to run away\r\nand marry him, thereby--according to the viewpoint of the\r\nfamily--ruining her chances in this world and her prospects in the next.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Matthew Wrenn had been the family outcast, and now time\r\nhad accomplished one more of its celebrated revenges. The death of\r\nColonel Derrick, which had followed that of his wife by a few months,\r\nhad revealed the fact that in addition to Norman blood he had also had\r\nthe simple faith which the poet ranks so much more highly--it taking the\r\nform of trusting prospectuses which should not have deceived a child\r\nand endeavouring to make up losses caused by the diminishing value of\r\nland with a series of speculations, each of them more futile and\r\ndisastrous than the last. His capital had gone to the four winds,\r\nMidways had gone to the mortgagees, and Kay, apprised of these facts by\r\na sympathetic family lawyer, had gone to Mr. Matthew Wrenn, now for many\r\nyears the editor of that same Pyke’s _Home Companion_ of which he had\r\nonce been the mere representative.\r\n\r\nThe omnibus stopped at the corner of Burberry Road, and Kay, alighting,\r\nwalked toward San Rafael. Burberry Road is not one of the more\r\nfashionable and wealthy districts of Valley Fields, and most of the\r\nhouses in it are semi-detached. San Rafael belonged to this class, being\r\njoined, like a stucco Siamese Twin, in indissoluble union to its\r\nnext-door neighbour, Mon Repos. It had in front of it a strip of gravel,\r\ntwo apologetic-looking flower beds with evergreens in them, a fence, and\r\nin the fence a gate, modelled on the five-barred gates of the country.\r\n\r\nOut of this gate, as Kay drew near, there came an elderly gentleman,\r\ntall, with grey hair and a scholarly stoop.\r\n\r\n“Why, hullo, darling,” said Kay. “Where are you off to?”\r\n\r\nShe kissed her uncle affectionately, for she had grown very fond of him\r\nin the months of their companionship.\r\n\r\n“Just popping round to have a chat with Cornelius,” said Mr. Wrenn. “I\r\nthought I might get a game of chess.”\r\n\r\nIn actual years Matthew Wrenn was on the right side of fifty; but as\r\neditors of papers like Pyke’s _Home Companion_ are apt to do, he looked\r\nolder than he really was. He was a man of mild and dreamy aspect, and it\r\nbeing difficult to imagine him in any dashing rôle, Kay rather supposed\r\nthat the energy and fire which had produced the famous elopement must\r\nhave come from the lady’s side.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t be late for dinner,” she said. “Is Willoughby in?”\r\n\r\n“I left him in the garden.” Mr. Wrenn hesitated. “That’s a curious young\r\nman, Kay.”\r\n\r\n“It’s an awful shame that he should be inflicted on you, darling,” said\r\nKay. “His housekeeper shooed him out of his house, you know. She wanted\r\nto give it a thorough cleaning. And he hates staying at clubs and\r\nhotels, and I’ve known him all my life, and he asked me if we could put\r\nhim up, and--well, there you are. But cheer up, it’s only for to-night.”\r\n\r\n“My dear, you know I’m only too glad to put up any friend of yours. But\r\nhe’s such a peculiar young fellow. I have been trying to talk to him for\r\nan hour, and all he does is to look at me like a goldfish.”\r\n\r\n“Like a goldfish?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, with his eyes staring and his lips moving without any sound coming\r\nfrom them.”\r\n\r\nKay laughed.\r\n\r\n“It’s his speech. I forgot to tell you. The poor lamb has got to make a\r\nspeech to-night at the annual dinner of the Old Boys of his school. He’s\r\nnever made one before, and it’s weighing on his mind terribly.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn looked relieved.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I didn’t know. Honestly, my dear, I thought that he must be\r\nmentally deficient.” He looked at his watch. “Well, if you think you can\r\nentertain him, I will be going along.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn went on his way; and Kay, passing through the five-barred\r\ngate, followed the little gravel path which skirted the house and came\r\ninto the garden.\r\n\r\nLike all the gardens in the neighbourhood, it was a credit to its\r\nowner--on the small side, but very green and neat and soothing. The fact\r\nthat, though so widely built over, Valley Fields has not altogether lost\r\nits ancient air of rusticity is due entirely to the zeal and devotion of\r\nits amateur horticulturists. More seeds are sold each spring in Valley\r\nFields, more lawn mowers pushed, more garden rollers borrowed, more\r\nsnails destroyed, more green fly squirted with patent mixtures, than in\r\nany other suburb on the Surrey side of the river. Brixton may have its\r\nBon Marché and Sydenham its Crystal Palace; but when it comes to\r\npansies, roses, tulips, hollyhocks and nasturtiums, Valley Fields points\r\nwith pride.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its other attractive features, the garden of San Rafael\r\ncontained at this moment a pinkish, stoutish, solemn young man in a\r\nbrown suit, who was striding up and down the lawn with a glassy stare in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Willoughby,” said Kay.\r\n\r\nThe young man came out of his trance with a strong physical convulsion.\r\n\r\n“Oh, hullo, Kay.”\r\n\r\nHe followed her across the lawn to the tea table which stood in the\r\nshade of a fine tree. For there are trees in this favoured spot as well\r\nas flowers.\r\n\r\n“Tea, Willoughby?” said Kay, sinking gratefully into a deck chair. “Or\r\nhave you had yours?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I had some.... I think----” Mr. Braddock weighed the question\r\nthoughtfully. “Yes.... Yes, I’ve had some.”\r\n\r\nKay filled her cup and sipped luxuriously.\r\n\r\n“Golly, I’m tired!” she said.\r\n\r\n“Had a bad day?”\r\n\r\n“Much the same as usual.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. B. not too cordial?”\r\n\r\n“Not very. And, unfortunately, the son and heir was cordiality itself.”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock nodded.\r\n\r\n“A bit of a trial, that lad.”\r\n\r\n“A bit.”\r\n\r\n“Wants kicking.”\r\n\r\n“Very badly.”\r\n\r\nKay gave a little wriggle of distaste. Technically, her duties at\r\nThurloe Square consisted of reading and writing Mrs. Winnington-Bates’\r\nletters; but what she was engaged for principally, she sometimes\r\nthought, was to act as a sort of spiritual punching bag for her\r\nemployer. To-day that lady had been exceptionally trying. Her son, on\r\nthe other hand, who had recently returned to his home after an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to learn poultry farming in Sussex and was lounging\r\nabout it, with little to occupy him, had shown himself, in his few\r\nmoments of opportunity, more than usually gallant. What life needed to\r\nmake it a trifle easier, Kay felt, was for Mrs. Bates to admire her a\r\nlittle more and for Claude Bates to admire her a little less.\r\n\r\n“I remember him at school,” said Mr. Braddock. “A worm.”\r\n\r\n“Was he at school with you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Younger than me. A beastly little kid who stuffed himself with\r\nfood and frousted over fires and shirked games. I remember Sam Shotter\r\nlicking him once for stealing jam sandwiches at the school shop. By the\r\nway, Sam’s coming over here. I had a letter from him.”\r\n\r\n“Is he? And who is he? You’ve never mentioned his name before.”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t I told you about old Sam Shotter?” asked Mr. Braddock,\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n“Never. But he sounds wonderfully attractive. Anyone who licked Claude\r\nBates must have a lot of good in him.”\r\n\r\n“He was at school with me.”\r\n\r\n“What a lot of people seem to have been at school with you!”\r\n\r\n“Well, there were about six hundred fellows at Wrykyn, you know. Sam and\r\nI shared a study. Now there is a chap I envy. He’s knocked about all\r\nover the world, having all sorts of fun. America one day, Australia the\r\nnext, Africa the day after.”\r\n\r\n“Quick mover,” said Kay.\r\n\r\n“The last I heard from him he was in his uncle’s office in New York, but\r\nin this letter he says he’s coming over to work at Tilbury House.”\r\n\r\n“Tilbury House? Really? I wonder if uncle will meet him.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think it would be a sound move if I gave him a dinner or\r\nsomething where he could meet a few of the lads? You and your uncle, of\r\ncourse--and if I could get hold of old Tilbury.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know Lord Tilbury?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; I play bridge with him sometimes at the club. And he took my\r\nshooting last year.”\r\n\r\n“When does Mr. Shotter arrive?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. He says it’s uncertain. You see, he’s coming over on a\r\ntramp steamer.”\r\n\r\n“A tramp steamer? Why?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s the sort of thing he does. Sort of thing I’d like to do\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“You?” said Kay, amazed. Willoughby Braddock had always seemed to her a\r\nman to whose well-being the refinements--and even the luxuries--of\r\ncivilisation were essential. One of her earliest recollections was of\r\nsitting in a tree and hurling juvenile insults at him, it having come to\r\nher ears through reliable channels that he habitually wore bed socks.\r\n“What nonsense, Willoughby! You would hate roughing it.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t,” said Mr. Braddock stoutly. “I’d love a bit of adventure.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why don’t you have it? You’ve got plenty of money. You could be a\r\npirate of the Spanish Main if you wanted.”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock shook his head wistfully.\r\n\r\n“I can’t get away from Mrs. Lippett.”\r\n\r\nWilloughby Braddock was one of those unfortunate bachelors who are\r\ndoomed to live under the thrall of either a housekeeper or a valet. His\r\nparticular cross in life was his housekeeper, his servitude being\r\nrendered all the more unescapable by the fact that Mrs. Lippett had been\r\nhis nurse in the days of his childhood. There are men who can defy a\r\nwoman. There are men who can cope with a faithful old retainer. But if\r\nthere are men who can tackle a faithful old female retainer who has\r\nfrequently smacked them with the back of a hairbrush, Willoughby\r\nBraddock was not one of them.\r\n\r\n“She would have a fit or go into a decline or something if I tried to\r\nbreak loose.”\r\n\r\n“Poor old Willoughby! Life can be very hard, can’t it? By the way, I met\r\nmy uncle outside. He was complaining that you were not very chummy.”\r\n\r\n“No, was he?”\r\n\r\n“He said you just sat there looking at him like a goldfish.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say!” said Mr. Braddock remorsefully. “I’m awfully sorry. I mean,\r\nafter he’s been so decent, putting me up and everything. I hope you\r\nexplained to him that I was frightfully worried about this speech.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did. But I don’t see why you should be. It’s perfectly simple\r\nmaking a speech. Especially at an Old Boys’ dinner, where they won’t\r\nexpect anything very much. If I were you, I should just get up and tell\r\nthem one or two funny stories and sit down again.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got one story,” said Mr. Braddock more hopefully. “It’s about an\r\nIrishman.”\r\n\r\n“Pat or Mike?”\r\n\r\n“I thought of calling him Pat. He’s in New York and he goes down to the\r\ndock and he sees a diver coming up out of the water--in a diving suit,\r\nyou know--and he thinks the fellow--the diver, you understand--has\r\nwalked across the Atlantic and wishes he had thought of doing the same\r\nhimself, so as to have saved the fare, don’t you know.”\r\n\r\n“I see. One of those weak-minded Irishmen.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think it will amuse them?” asked Mr. Braddock anxiously.\r\n\r\n“I should think they would roll off their seats.”\r\n\r\n“No, really?” He broke off and stretched out a hand in alarm. “I say,\r\nyou weren’t thinking of having one of those rock cakes, were you?”\r\n\r\n“I was. But I won’t if you don’t want me to. Aren’t they good?”\r\n\r\n“Good? My dear old soul,” said Mr. Braddock earnestly, “they are Clara’s\r\nworst effort--absolutely her very worst. I had to eat one because she\r\ncame and stood over me and watched me do it. It beats me why you don’t\r\nsack that girl. She’s a rotten cook.”\r\n\r\n“Sack Claire?” Kay laughed. “You might just as well try to sack her\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’re right.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t sack a Lippett.”\r\n\r\n“No, I see what you mean. I wish she wasn’t so dashed familiar with a\r\nfellow, though.”\r\n\r\n“Well, she has known you almost as long as I have. Mrs. Lippett has\r\nalways been a sort of mother to you, so I suppose Claire regards herself\r\nas a sort of sister.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose it can’t be helped,” said Mr. Braddock bravely. He\r\nglanced at his watch. “Ought to be going and dressing. I’ll find you out\r\nhere before I leave?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be pushing along. I say, you do think that story about the\r\nIrishman is all right?”\r\n\r\n“Best thing I ever heard,” said Kay loyally.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes after he had left her she sat back in her chair with\r\nher eyes closed, relaxing in the evening stillness of this pleasant\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n“Finished with the tea, Miss Kay?”\r\n\r\nKay opened her eyes. A solid little figure in a print dress was standing\r\nat her side. A jaunty maid’s cap surmounted this person’s tow-coloured\r\nhair. She had a perky nose and a wide, friendly mouth, and she beamed\r\nupon Kay devotedly.\r\n\r\n“Brought you these,” she said, dropping a rug, two cushions and a\r\nfootstool, beneath the burden of which she had been staggering across\r\nthe lawn like a small pack mule. “Make you nice and comfortable, and\r\nthen you can get a nice nap. I can see you’re all tired out.”\r\n\r\n“That’s awfully good of you, Claire. But you shouldn’t have bothered.”\r\n\r\nClaire Lippett, daughter of Willoughby Braddock’s autocratic housekeeper\r\nand cook and maid-of-all-work at San Rafael, was a survivor of the\r\nMidways epoch. She had entered the Derrick household at the age of\r\ntwelve, her duties at that time being vague and leaving her plenty of\r\nleisure for surreptitious bird’s-nesting with Kay, then thirteen. On her\r\neighteenth birthday she had been promoted to the post of Kay’s personal\r\nmaid, and from that moment may be said formally to have taken charge.\r\nThe Lippett motto was Fidelity, and not even the famous financial crash\r\nhad been able to dislodge this worthy daughter of the clan. Resolutely\r\nfollowing Kay into exile, she had become, as stated, Mr. Wrenn’s cook.\r\nAnd, as Mr. Braddock had justly remarked, a very bad cook too.\r\n\r\n“You oughtn’t to go getting yourself all tired, Miss Kay. You ought to\r\nbe sitting at your ease.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so I am,” said Kay.\r\n\r\nThere were times when, like Mr. Braddock, she found the Lippett\r\nprotectiveness a little cloying. She was a high-spirited girl and wanted\r\nto face the world with a defiant “Who cares?” and it was not easy to do\r\nthis with Claire coddling her all the time as if she were a fragile and\r\nsensitive plant. Resistance, however, was useless. Nobody had ever yet\r\nsucceeded in curbing the motherly spirit of the Lippetts, and probably\r\nnobody ever would.\r\n\r\n“Meantersay,” explained Claire, adjusting the footstool, “you ought not\r\nto be soiling your hands with work, that’s what I mean. It’s a shame you\r\nshould be having to----”\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly. She had picked up the tea tray and made a wounding\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t touched my rock cakes,” she said in a voice in which\r\nreproach and disappointment were nicely blended. “And I made them for\r\nyou special.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want to spoil my dinner,” said Kay hastily. Claire was a\r\ntemperamental girl, quick to resent slurs on her handiwork. “I’m sure\r\nyou’ve got something nice.”\r\n\r\nClaire considered the point.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes and no,” she said. “If you’re thinking of the pudding, I’m\r\nafraid that’s off. The kitten fell into the custard.”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“She did. And when I’d fished her out there wasn’t hardly any left.\r\nSeemed to have soaked it into her like as if she was a sponge. Still,\r\nthere ’ud be enough for you if Mr. Wrenn didn’t want any.”\r\n\r\n“No, it doesn’t matter, thanks,” said Kay earnestly.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m trying a new soup, which’ll sort of make up for it. It’s one\r\nI read in a book. It’s called pottage ar lar princess. You’re sure you\r\nwon’t have one of these rock cakes, Miss Kay? Put strength into you.”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks, really.”\r\n\r\n“Right-ho; just as you say.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lippett crossed the lawn and disappeared, and a soothing peace fell\r\nupon the garden. A few minutes later, however, just as Kay’s head was\r\nbeginning to nod, from an upper window there suddenly blared forth on\r\nthe still air a loud and raucous voice, suggestive of costermongers\r\nadvertising their Brussels sprouts or those who call the cattle home\r\nacross the Sands of Dee.\r\n\r\n“I am reminded by a remark of our worthy president,” roared the voice,\r\n“of a little story which may be new to some of you present here\r\nto-night. It seems that a certain Irishman had gone down to New York--I\r\nmean, he was in New York and had gone down to the docks--and while\r\nthere--while there----”\r\n\r\nThe voice trailed off. Apparently the lungs were willing but the memory\r\nwas weak. Presently it broke out in another place.\r\n\r\n“For the school, gentlemen, our dear old school, occupies a place in\r\nour hearts--a place in our hearts--in the hearts of all of us--in\r\nall our hearts--in our hearts, gentlemen--which nothing else can\r\nfill. It forms, if I may put it that way, Mr. President and\r\ngentlemen--forms--forms--forms a link that links the generations.\r\nWhether we are fifty years old or forty or thirty or twenty, we are none\r\nthe less all of us contemporaries. And why? Because, gentlemen, we are\r\nall--er--linked by that link.”\r\n\r\n“Jolly good!” murmured Kay, impressed.\r\n\r\n“That is why, Mr. President and gentlemen, though I am glad, delighted,\r\npleased, happy and--er--overjoyed to see so many of you responding to\r\nthe annual call of our dear old school, I am not surprised.”\r\n\r\nFrom the kitchen door, a small knife in one hand and a half-peeled onion\r\nin the other, there emerged the stocky figure of Claire Lippett. She\r\ngazed up at the window wrathfully.\r\n\r\n“Hi!”\r\n\r\n“No, not surprised.”\r\n\r\n“Hi!”\r\n\r\n“And talking of being surprised, I am reminded of a little story which\r\nmay be new to some of you present here to-night. It seems that a certain\r\nIrishman----”\r\n\r\nFrom the days when their ancestresses had helped the menfolk of the\r\ntribe to make marauding Danes wish they had stayed in Denmark, the\r\nfemale members of Claire Lippett’s family had always been women of\r\naction. Having said “Hi!” twice, their twentieth-century descendant\r\nseemed to consider that she had done all that could reasonably be\r\nexpected of her in the way of words. With a graceful swing of her right\r\narm, she sent the onion shooting upward. And such was the never-failing\r\nefficiency of this masterly girl that it whizzed through the open\r\nwindow, from which, after a brief interval, there appeared, leaning\r\nout, the dress-shirted and white-tied upper portion of Mr. Willoughby\r\nBraddock. He was rubbing his ear.\r\n\r\n“Be quiet, can’t you?” said Miss Lippett.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock gazed austerely into the depths. Except that the positions\r\nof the characters were inverted and the tone of the dialogue somewhat\r\ndifferent, it might have been the big scene out of _Romeo and Juliet_.\r\n\r\n“What did you say?”\r\n\r\n“I said be quiet. Miss Kay wants to get a bit of sleep. How can she get\r\na bit of sleep with that row going on?”\r\n\r\n“Clara!” said Mr. Braddock portentously.\r\n\r\n“Claire,” corrected the girl coldly, insisting on a point for which she\r\nhad had to fight all her life.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock gulped.\r\n\r\n“I shall--er--I shall speak to your mother,” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was a futile threat, and Claire signified as much by jerking her\r\nshoulder in a scornful and derogatory manner before stumping back to the\r\nhouse with all the honours of war. She knew--and Mr. Braddock knew that\r\nshe knew--that complaints respecting her favourite daughter would be\r\ncoldly received by Mrs. Lippett.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock withdrew from the window, and presently appeared in the\r\ngarden, beautifully arrayed.\r\n\r\n“Why, Willoughby,” said Kay admiringly, “you look wonderful!”\r\n\r\nThe kindly compliment did much to soothe Mr. Braddock’s wounded\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n“No, really?” he said; and felt, as he had so often felt before, that\r\nKay was a girl in a million, and that if only the very idea of\r\nmatrimony did not scare a fellow so confoundedly, a fellow might very\r\nwell take a chance and see what would happen if he asked her to marry\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“And the speech sounded fine.”\r\n\r\n“Really? You know, I got a sudden fear that my voice might not carry.”\r\n\r\n“It carries,” Kay assured him.\r\n\r\nThe clouds which her compliments had chased from Mr. Braddock’s brow\r\ngathered again.\r\n\r\n“I say, Kay, you know, you really ought to do something about that girl\r\nClara. She’s impossible. I mean, throwing onions at a fellow.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t mind. Don’t worry about her; it’ll make you forget your\r\nspeech. How long are you supposed to talk?”\r\n\r\n“About ten minutes, I imagine. You know, this is going to just about\r\nkill me.”\r\n\r\n“What you must do is drink lots and lots of champagne.”\r\n\r\n“But it makes me spotty.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be spotty. I shan’t mind.”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock considered.\r\n\r\n“I will,” he said. “It’s a very good idea. Well, I suppose I ought to be\r\ngoing.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got your key? That’s right. You won’t be back till pretty late,\r\nof course. I’ll go and tell Claire not to bolt the door.”\r\n\r\nWhen Kay reached the kitchen she found that her faithful follower had\r\nstepped out of the pages of _Romeo and Juliet_ into those of _Macbeth_.\r\nShe was bending over a cauldron, dropping things into it. The kitten,\r\nnow comparatively dry and decustarded, eyed her with bright interest\r\nfrom a shelf on the dresser.\r\n\r\n“This is the new soup, Miss Kay,” she announced with modest pride.\r\n\r\n“It smells fine,” said Kay, wincing slightly as a painful aroma of\r\nburning smote her nostrils. “I say, Claire, I wish you wouldn’t throw\r\nonions at Mr. Braddock.”\r\n\r\n“I went up and got it back,” Claire reassured her. “It’s in the soup\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be in the soup if you do that sort of thing. What,” asked Kay\r\nvirtuously, “will the neighbours say?”\r\n\r\n“There aren’t any neighbours,” Claire pointed out. A wistful look came\r\ninto her perky face. “I wish someone would hurry up and move into Mon\r\nRee-poss,” she said. “I don’t like not having next-doors. Gets lonely\r\nfor a girl all day with no one to talk to.”\r\n\r\n“Well, when you talk to Mr. Braddock, don’t do it at the top of your\r\nvoice. Please understand that I don’t like it.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Claire simply, “you’re cross with me.” And without further\r\npreamble she burst into a passionate flood of tears.\r\n\r\nIt was this sensitiveness of hers that made it so difficult for the\r\nyoung chatelaine of San Rafael to deal with the domestic staff. Kay was\r\na warm-hearted girl, and a warm-hearted girl can never be completely at\r\nher ease when she is making cooks cry. It took ten minutes of sedulous\r\npetting to restore the emotional Miss Lippett to her usual cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n“I’ll never raise my voice so much as above a whisper to the man,” she\r\nannounced remorsefully at the end of that period. “All the same----”\r\n\r\nKay had no desire to reopen the Braddock argument.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, Claire. What I really came to say was--don’t put the\r\nchain up on the front door to-night, because Mr. Braddock is sure to be\r\nlate. But he will come in quite quietly and won’t disturb you.”\r\n\r\n“He’d better not,” said Miss Lippett grimly. “I’ve got a revolver.”\r\n\r\n“A revolver!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Claire bent darkly over her cauldron. “You never know when there\r\nwon’t be burglars in these low parts. The girl at Pontresina down the\r\nroad was telling me they’d had a couple of milk cans sneaked off their\r\ndoorstep only yesterday. And I’ll tell you another thing, Miss Kay. It’s\r\nmy belief there’s been people breaking into Mon Ree-poss.”\r\n\r\n“What would they do that for? It’s empty.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t empty last night. I was looking out of the window with one of\r\nmy noo-ralgic headaches--must have been between two and three in the\r\nmorning--and there was mysterious lights going up and down the\r\nstaircase.”\r\n\r\n“You imagined it.”\r\n\r\n“Begging your pardon, Miss Kay, I did not imagine it. There they were,\r\nas plain as plain. Might have been one of these electric torches the\r\ncriminal classes use. If you want to know what I think, Miss Kay, that\r\nMon Ree-poss is what I call a house of mystery, and I shan’t be sorry\r\nwhen somebody respectable comes and takes it. The way it is now, we’re\r\njust as likely as not to wake up and find ourselves all murdered in our\r\nbeds.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t be so nervous.”\r\n\r\n“Nervous?” replied Claire indignantly. “Nervous? Take more than a\r\nburglar to make me nervous. All I’m saying is, I’m prepared.”\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t go shooting Mr. Braddock.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Miss Lippett, declining to commit herself, “is as may be.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nSAILORS DON’T CARE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome five hours after Willoughby Braddock’s departure from San Rafael, a\r\nyoung man came up Villiers Street, and turning into the Strand, began to\r\nstroll slowly eastward. The Strand, it being the hour when the theatres\r\nhad begun to empty themselves, was a roaring torrent of humanity and\r\nvehicles; and he looked upon the bustling scene with the affectionate\r\neye of one who finds the turmoil of London novel and attractive. He was\r\na nice-looking young man, but what was most immediately noticeable about\r\nhim was his extraordinary shabbiness. Both his shoes were split across\r\nthe toe; his hands were in the pockets of a stained and weather-beaten\r\npair of blue trousers; and he gazed about him from under the brim of a\r\nsoft hat which could have been worn without exciting comment by any\r\nscarecrow.\r\n\r\nSo striking was his appearance that two exquisites, emerging from the\r\nSavoy Hotel and pausing on the pavement to wait for a vacant taxi, eyed\r\nhim with pained disapproval as he approached, and then, starting, stared\r\nin amazement.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” said the first exquisite.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” said the second.\r\n\r\n“See who that is?”\r\n\r\n“S. P. Shotter! Used to be in the School House.”\r\n\r\n“Captain of football my last year.”\r\n\r\n“But, I say, it can’t be! Dressed like that, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“It is.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!”\r\n\r\nThese two were men who had, in the matter of costume, a high standard.\r\nThemselves snappy and conscientious dressers, they judged their fellows\r\nhardly. Yet even an indulgent critic would have found it difficult not\r\nto shake his head over the spectacle presented by Sam Shotter as he\r\nwalked the Strand that night.\r\n\r\nThe fact is it is not easy for a young man of adventurous and\r\ninquisitive disposition to remain dapper throughout a voyage on a tramp\r\nsteamer. The _Araminta_, which had arrived at Millwall Dock that\r\nafternoon, had taken fourteen days to cross the Atlantic, and during\r\nthose fourteen days Sam had entered rather fully into the many-sided\r\nlife of the ship. He had spent much time in an oily engine room; he had\r\nhelped the bos’n with a job of painting; he had accompanied the chief\r\nengineer on his rambles through the coal bunkers; and on more than one\r\noccasion had endeared himself to languid firemen by taking their shovels\r\nand doing a little amateur stoking. One cannot do these things and be\r\nfoppish.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it would have surprised him greatly had he known that his\r\nappearance was being adversely criticised, for he was in that happy\r\nframe of mind when men forget they have an appearance. He had dined\r\nwell, having as his guest his old friend Hash Todhunter. He had seen a\r\nmotion picture of squashy sex appeal. And now, having put Hash on an\r\neastbound tram, he was filled with that pleasant sense of well-being and\r\ncontent which comes on those rare occasions when the world is just about\r\nright. So far from being abashed by the shabbiness of his exterior Sam\r\nfound himself experiencing, as he strolled along the Strand, a\r\ngratifying illusion of having bought the place. He felt like the young\r\nsquire returned from his travels and revisiting the old village.\r\n\r\nNor, though he was by nature a gregarious young man and fond of human\r\nsociety, did the fact that he was alone depress him. Much as he liked\r\nHash Todhunter, he had not been sorry to part from him. Usually an\r\nentertaining companion, Hash had been a little tedious to-night, owing\r\nto a tendency to confine the conversation to the subject of a dog\r\nbelonging to a publican friend of his which was running in a whippet\r\nrace at Hackney Marshes next morning. Hash had, it seemed, betted his\r\nentire savings on this animal, and not content with this, had pestered\r\nSam to lend him all his remaining cash to add to the investment. And\r\nthough Sam had found no difficulty in remaining firm, it is always a\r\nbore to have to keep saying no.\r\n\r\nThe two exquisites looked at each other apprehensively.\r\n\r\n“Shift ho, before he touches us, what?” said the first.\r\n\r\n“Shift absolutely ho,” assented the second.\r\n\r\nIt was too late. The companion of their boyhood had come up, and after\r\nstarting to pass had paused, peering at them from under that dreadful\r\nhat, which seemed to cut them like a knife, in the manner of one trying\r\nto identify half-remembered faces.\r\n\r\n“Bates and Tresidder!” he exclaimed at length. “By Jove!”\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” said the first exquisite.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said the second.\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” said Sam.\r\n\r\nThere followed one of those awkward silences which so often occur at\r\nthese meetings of old schoolmates. The two exquisites were wondering\r\ndismally when the inevitable touch would come, and Sam had just\r\nrecollected that these were two blighters whom, when _in statu\r\npupillari_, he had particularly disliked. Nevertheless, etiquette\r\ndemanded that a certain modicum of conversation be made.\r\n\r\n“What have you been doing with yourselves?” asked Sam. “You look very\r\nfestive.”\r\n\r\n“Been dining,” said the first exquisite.\r\n\r\n“Old Wrykynian dinner,” said the second.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, of course. It always was at this time of year, wasn’t it? Lots\r\nof the lads there, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Good dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Goodish,” said the first exquisite.\r\n\r\n“Not baddish,” said the second.\r\n\r\n“Rotten speeches, though.”\r\n\r\n“Awful!”\r\n\r\n“Can’t think where they dig these blokes up.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“That man Braddock.”\r\n\r\n“Frightful.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me the old Bradder actually made a speech!” said Sam,\r\npleased. “Was he very bad?”\r\n\r\n“Worst of the lot.”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely!”\r\n\r\n“That story about the Irishman.”\r\n\r\n“Foul!”\r\n\r\n“And all that rot about the dear old school.”\r\n\r\n“Ghastly!”\r\n\r\n“If you ask me,” said the first exquisite severely, “my opinion is that\r\nhe was as tight as an owl.”\r\n\r\n“Stewed to the eyebrows,” said the second.\r\n\r\n“I watched him during dinner and he was mopping up the stuff like a\r\nvacuum cleaner.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the first exquisite uncomfortably, “we must be pushing on.”\r\n\r\n“Dashing off,” said the second exquisite.\r\n\r\n“Got to go to supper at the Angry Cheese.”\r\n\r\n“The where?” asked Sam.\r\n\r\n“Angry Cheese. New night-club in Panton Street. See you sometime, what?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nAnother silence was about to congeal, when a taxi crawled up and the two\r\nexquisites leaped joyously in.\r\n\r\n“Awful, a fellow going right under like that,” said the first.\r\n\r\n“Ghastly,” said the second.\r\n\r\n“Lucky we got away.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“He was shaping for a touch,” said the first exquisite.\r\n\r\n“Trembling on his lips,” said the second.\r\n\r\nSam walked on. Although the Messrs. Bates and Tresidder had never been\r\nfavourites of his, they belonged to what Mr. Braddock would have\r\ncalled--and, indeed, had called no fewer than eleven times in his speech\r\nthat night--the dear old school; and the meeting with them had left him\r\npleasantly stimulated. The feeling of being a _seigneur_ revisiting his\r\nestates after long absence grew as he threaded his way through the\r\ncrowd. He eyed the passers-by in a jolly, Laughing Cavalier sort of way,\r\nwishing he knew them well enough to slap them on the back. And when he\r\nreached the corner of Wellington Street and came upon a disheveled\r\nvocalist singing mournfully in the gutter, he could not but feel it a\r\npersonal affront that this sort of thing should be going on in his\r\ndomain. He was conscious of a sensation of being individually\r\nresponsible for this poor fellow’s reduced condition, and the situation\r\nseemed to him to call for largess.\r\n\r\nOn setting out that night Sam had divided his money into two portions.\r\nHis baggage, together with his letter of credit, had preceded him across\r\nthe ocean on the _Mauretania_; and as it might be a day or so before he\r\ncould establish connection with it, he had prudently placed the bulk of\r\nhis ready money in his note-case, earmarking it for the purchase of new\r\nclothes and other necessaries on the morrow so that he might be enabled\r\nto pay his first visit to Tilbury House in becoming state. The\r\nremainder, sufficient for the evening’s festivities, he had put in his\r\ntrousers pockets.\r\n\r\nIt was into his right trousers pocket therefore that he now groped. His\r\nfingers closed on a half-crown. He promptly dropped it. He was feeling\r\n_seigneurial_, but not so _seigneurial_ as that. Something more in the\r\nnature of a couple of coppers was what he was looking for, and it\r\nsurprised him to find that except for the half-crown the pocket appeared\r\nto be empty. He explored the other pocket. That was empty too.\r\n\r\nThe explanation was, of course, that the life of pleasure comes high.\r\nYou cannot go stuffing yourself and a voracious sea cook at restaurants,\r\ntaking buses and Underground trains all over the place, and finally\r\nwinding up at a cinema palace, without cutting into your capital. Sam\r\nwas reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the half-crown was his\r\nonly remaining spare coin. He was, accordingly, about to abandon the\r\nidea of largess and move on, when the vocalist, having worked his way\r\nthrough You’re the Sort of a Girl That Men Forget, began to sing that\r\nother popular ballad entitled Sailors Don’t Care. And it was no doubt\r\nthe desire to refute the slur implied in these words on the great\r\nbrotherhood of which he was an amateur member that decided Sam to be\r\nlavish.\r\n\r\nThe half-crown changed hands.\r\n\r\nSam resumed his walk. At a quarter past eleven at night there is little\r\nto amuse and interest the stroller east of Wellington Street, so he now\r\ncrossed the road and turned westward. And he had not been walking more\r\nthan a few paces when he found himself looking into the brightly lighted\r\nwindow of a small restaurant that appeared to specialise in shellfish.\r\nThe slab beyond the glass was paved with the most insinuating oysters.\r\nOvercome with emotion, Sam stopped in his tracks.\r\n\r\nThere is something about the oyster, nestling in its shell, which in the\r\nhours that come when the theatres are closed and London is beginning to\r\ngive itself up to nocturnal revelry stirs right-thinking men like a\r\nbugle. There swept over Sam a sudden gnawing desire for nourishment.\r\nOysters with brown bread and a little stout were, he perceived, just\r\nwhat this delightful evening demanded by way of a fitting climax. He\r\npulled out his note-case. Even if it meant an inferior suit next\r\nmorning, one of those Treasury notes which lay there must be broken into\r\nhere and now.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Sam, looking back later at this moment, that at the very\r\nfirst touch the note-case had struck him as being remarkably thin. It\r\nappeared to have lost its old jolly plumpness, as if some wasting fever\r\nhad struck it. Indeed, it gave the impression, when he opened it, of\r\nbeing absolutely empty.\r\n\r\nIt was not absolutely empty. It is true that none of the Treasury notes\r\nremained, but there was something inside--a dirty piece of paper on\r\nwhich were words written in pencil. He read them by the light that\r\npoured from the restaurant window:\r\n\r\n     “DEAR SAM,--You will doubtless be surprised, Sam, to learn that I\r\n     have borowed your money. Dear Sam, I will send it back tomorow A.M.\r\n     prompt. Nothing can beat that wipet, Sam, so I have borowed your\r\n     money.\r\n\r\n     “Trusting this finds you in the pink,\r\n\r\n                            “Yrs. Obedtly,\r\n\r\n                            “C. TODHUNTER.”\r\n\r\nSam stood staring at this polished communication with sagging jaw. For\r\nan instant it had a certain obscurity, the word “wipet” puzzling him\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\nThen, unlike the missing money, it all came back to him.\r\n\r\nThe rush of traffic was diminishing now, and the roar of a few minutes\r\nback had become a mere rumble. It was almost as if London, sympathising\r\nwith his sorrow, had delicately hushed its giant voice. To such an\r\nextent, in fact, was its voice hushed that that of the Wellington Street\r\nvocalist was once more plainly audible, and there was in what he was\r\nsinging a poignant truth which had not impressed itself upon Sam when he\r\nhad first heard it.\r\n\r\n“Sailors don’t care,” chanted the vocalist. “Sailors don’t care. It’s\r\nsomething to do with the salt in the blood. Sailors don’t care.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nSCENE OUTSIDE FASHIONABLE NIGHT-CLUB\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mental condition of a man who at half past eleven at night suddenly\r\nfinds himself penniless and without shelter in the heart of the great\r\ncity must necessarily be for a while somewhat confused. Sam’s first\r\ncoherent thought was to go back and try to recover that half-crown from\r\nthe wandering minstrel. After a very brief reflection, however, he\r\ndismissed this scheme as too visionary for practical consideration. His\r\nacquaintance with the other had been slight, but he had seen enough of\r\nhim to gather that he was not one of those rare spiritual fellows who\r\ngive half-crowns back. The minstrel was infirm and old, but many years\r\nwould have to elapse before he became senile enough for that. No, some\r\nsolution on quite different lines was required; and, thinking deeply,\r\nSam began to move slowly in the direction of Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nHe was as yet far from being hopeless. Indeed, his mood at this point\r\nmight have been called optimistic; for he realised that, if this\r\ndisaster had been decreed by fate from the beginning of time--and he\r\nsupposed it had been, though that palmist had made no mention of it--it\r\ncould hardly have happened at a more convenient spot. The Old Wrykynian\r\ndinner had only just broken up, which meant that this portion of London\r\nmust be full of men who had been at school with him and would doubtless\r\nbe delighted to help him out with a temporary loan. At any moment now he\r\nmight run into some kindly old schoolfellow.\r\n\r\nAnd almost immediately he did. Or, rather, the old schoolfellow ran into\r\nhim. He had reached the Vaudeville Theatre and had paused, debating\r\nwithin himself the advisability of crossing the street and seeing how\r\nthe hunting was on the other side, when a solid body rammed him in the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sorry! Frightfully sorry! I say, awfully sorry!”\r\n\r\nIt was a voice which had been absent from Sam’s life for some years, but\r\nhe recognised it almost before he had recovered his balance. He wheeled\r\njoyfully round on the stout and red-faced young man who was with some\r\ndifficulty retrieving his hat from the gutter.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but you are extraordinarily like a man I used to\r\nknow named J. W. Braddock.”\r\n\r\n“I am J. W. Braddock.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Sam, “that accounts for the resemblance.”\r\n\r\nHe contemplated his erstwhile study companion with affection. He would\r\nhave been glad at any time to meet the old Bradder, but he was\r\nparticularly glad to meet him now. As Mr. Braddock himself might have\r\nput it, he was glad, delighted, pleased, happy and overjoyed. Willoughby\r\nBraddock, bearing out the words of the two exquisites, was obviously in\r\na somewhat vinous condition, but Sam was no Puritan and was not offended\r\nby this. The thing about Mr. Braddock that impressed itself upon him to\r\nthe exclusion of all else was the fact that he looked remarkably rich.\r\nHe had that air, than which there is none more delightful, of being the\r\nsort of man who would lend a fellow a fiver without a moment’s\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nWilloughby Braddock had secured his hat, and he now replaced it in a\r\nsketchy fashion on his head. His face was flushed, and his eyes, always\r\nslightly prominent, seemed to protrude like those of a snail--and an\r\nextremely inebriated snail, at that.\r\n\r\n“Imarraspeesh,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“I made a speesh.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, so I heard.”\r\n\r\n“You heard my speesh?”\r\n\r\n“I heard that you had made one.”\r\n\r\n“How did you hear my speesh?” said Mr. Braddock, plainly mystified. “You\r\nweren’t at the dinner.”\r\n\r\n“No, but----”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t have been at the dinner,” proceeded Mr. Braddock,\r\nreasoning closely, “because evening dress was obliggery and you aren’t\r\nobliggery. I’ll tell you what--between you and me, I don’t know who the\r\ndeuce you are.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know me?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t know you.”\r\n\r\n“Pull yourself together, Bradder. I’m Sam Shotter.”\r\n\r\n“Sham Sotter?”\r\n\r\n“If you prefer it that way certainly. I’ve always pronounced it Sam\r\nShotter myself.”\r\n\r\n“Sam Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock eyed him narrowly.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” he said, “I’ll tell you something--something that’ll\r\ninterest you--something that’ll interest you very much. You’re Sam\r\nShotter.”\r\n\r\n“That’s it.”\r\n\r\n“We were at school together.”\r\n\r\n“We were.”\r\n\r\n“The dear old school.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\nIntense delight manifested itself in Mr. Braddock’s face. He seized\r\nSam’s hand and wrung it warmly.\r\n\r\n“How are you, my dear old chap, how are you?” he cried. “Old Sham\r\nSpotter, by gad! By Jove! By George! My goodness! Fancy that! Well,\r\ngood-bye.”\r\n\r\nAnd with a beaming smile he suddenly swooped across the road and was\r\nlost to sight.\r\n\r\nThe stoutest heart may have its black moments. Depression claimed Sam\r\nfor its own. There is no agony like that of the man who has intended to\r\nborrow money and finds that he has postponed the request till too late.\r\nWith bowed shoulders, he made his way eastward. He turned up Charing\r\nCross Road, and thence by way of Green Street into Leicester Square. He\r\nmoved listlessly along the lower end of the square, and presently,\r\nglancing up, perceived graven upon the wall the words, “Panton Street.”\r\n\r\nHe halted. The name seemed somehow familiar. Then he remembered. The\r\nAngry Cheese, that haunt of wealth and fashion to which those fellows,\r\nBates and Tresidder, had been going, was in Panton Street.\r\n\r\nHope revived in Sam. An instant before, the iron had seemed to have\r\nentered his soul, but now he squared his shoulder and quickened his\r\nsteps. Good old Bates! Splendid old Tresidder! They were the men to help\r\nhim out of this mess.\r\n\r\nHe saw clearly now how mistaken can be the callow judgments which we\r\nform when young. As an immature lad at school, he had looked upon Bates\r\nand Tresidder with a jaundiced eye. He had summed them up in his mind,\r\nafter the hasty fashion of youth, as ticks and blisters. Aye, and even\r\nwhen he had encountered them half an hour ago after the lapse of years,\r\ntheir true nobility had not been made plain to him. It was only now, as\r\nhe padded along Panton Street like a leopard on the trail, that he\r\nrealised what excellent fellows they were and how fond he was of them.\r\nThey were great chaps--corkers, both of them. And when he remembered\r\nthat with a boy’s blindness to his sterling qualities he had once given\r\nBates six of the juiciest with a walking stick, he burned with remorse\r\nand shame.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to find the Angry Cheese. About this newest of\r\nLondon’s night-clubs there was nothing coy or reticent. Its doorway\r\nstood open to the street, and cabs were drawing up in a constant stream\r\nand discharging fair women and well-tailored men. Furthermore, to render\r\nidentification easy for the very dullest, there stood on the pavement\r\noutside a vast commissionaire, brilliantly attired in the full-dress\r\nuniform of a Czecho-Slovakian field-marshal and wearing on his head a\r\npeaked cap circled by a red band, which bore in large letters of gold\r\nthe words “Angry Cheese.”\r\n\r\n“Good evening,” said Sam, curvetting buoyantly up to this spectacular\r\nperson. “I want to speak to Mr. Bates.”\r\n\r\nThe field-marshal eyed him distantly. The man, one would have said, was\r\nnot in sympathy with him. Sam could not imagine why. With the prospect\r\nof a loan in sight, he himself was liking everybody.\r\n\r\n“Misteroo?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bates.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Yates?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bates. Mr. Bates. You know Mr. Bates?” said Sam. And such was the\r\nstimulating rhythm of the melody into which the unseen orchestra had\r\njust burst that he very nearly added, “He’s a bear, he’s a bear, he’s a\r\nbear.”\r\n\r\n“Bates?”\r\n\r\n“Or Tresidder.”\r\n\r\n“Make up your mind,” said the field-marshal petulantly.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, on the opposite side of the street, there appeared the\r\nfigure of Mr. Willoughby Braddock, walking with extraordinary swiftness.\r\nHis eyes were staring straight in front of him. He had lost his hat.\r\n\r\n“Bradder!” cried Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock looked over his shoulder, waved his hand, smiled a smile of\r\npiercing sweetness and passed rapidly into the night.\r\n\r\nSam was in a state of indecision similar to that of the dog in the\r\ncelebrated substance-and-shadow fable. Should he pursue this\r\nwill-o’-the-wisp, or should he stick to the sound Conservative policy of\r\ntouching the man on the spot? What would Napoleon have done?\r\n\r\nHe decided to remain.\r\n\r\n“Fellow who was at school with me,” he remarked explanatorily.\r\n\r\n“Ho!” said the field-marshal, looking like a stuffed sergeant-major.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Sam, “can I see Mr. Bates?”\r\n\r\n“You cannot.”\r\n\r\n“But he’s in there.”\r\n\r\n“And you’re out ’ere,” said the field-marshal.\r\n\r\nHe moved away to assist a young lady of gay exterior to alight from a\r\ntaxicab. And as he did so, someone spoke from the steps.\r\n\r\n“Ah, there you are!”\r\n\r\nSam looked up, relieved. Dear old Bates was standing in the lighted\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nOf the four persons who made up the little group collected about the\r\nthreshold of the Angry Cheese, three now spoke simultaneously.\r\n\r\nDear old Bates said, “This is topping! Thought you weren’t coming.”\r\n\r\nThe lady said, “Awfully sorry I’m late, old cork.”\r\n\r\nSam said, “Oh, Bates.”\r\n\r\nHe was standing some little space removed from the main body when he\r\nspoke, and the words did not register. The lady passed on into the\r\nbuilding. Bates was preparing to follow her, when Sam spoke again. And\r\nthis time nobody within any reasonable radius could have failed to hear\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Hi, Bates!”\r\n\r\n“Hey!” said the field-marshal, massaging his ear with a look of reproach\r\nand dislike.\r\n\r\nBates turned, and as he saw Sam, there spread itself over his face the\r\nstartled look of one who, wandering gayly along some primrose path, sees\r\ngaping before him a frightful chasm or a fearful serpent or some\r\nmenacing lion in the undergrowth. In this crisis, Claude Bates did not\r\nhesitate. With a single backward spring--which, if he could have\r\nremembered it and reproduced it later on the dancing floor, would have\r\nmade him the admired of all--he disappeared, leaving Sam staring blankly\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nA large fat hand, placed in no cordial spirit on his shoulder, awoke Sam\r\nfrom his reverie. The field-marshal was gazing at him with a loathing\r\nwhich he now made no attempt to conceal.\r\n\r\n“You ’op it,” said the field-marshal. “We don’t want none of your sort\r\n’ere.”\r\n\r\n“But I was at school with him,” stammered Sam. The thing had been so\r\nsudden that even now he could not completely realise that what\r\npractically amounted to his own flesh and blood had thrown him down\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n“At school with ’im too, was you?” said the field-marshal. “The only\r\nschool you was ever at was Borstal. You ’op it, and quick. That’s what\r\nyou do, before I call a policeman.”\r\n\r\nInside the night-club, Claude Bates, restoring his nervous system with a\r\nwhisky and soda, was relating to his friend Tresidder the tale of his\r\nnarrow escape.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely lurking on the steps!” said Bates.\r\n\r\n“Ghastly!” said Tresidder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\nPAINFUL AFFAIR AT A COFFEE-STALL\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon was very quiet. A stillness had fallen upon it, broken only by\r\nthe rattle of an occasional cab and the footsteps of some home-seeking\r\nwayfarer. The lamplight shone on glistening streets, on pensive\r\npolicemen, on smoothly prowling cats, and on a young man in a shocking\r\nsuit of clothes whose faith in human nature was at zero.\r\n\r\nSam had now no definite objective. He was merely walking aimlessly with\r\nthe idea of killing time. He wandered on, and presently found that he\r\nhad passed out of the haunts of fashion into a meaner neighbourhood. The\r\nbuildings had become dingier, the aspect of the perambulating cats more\r\nsinister and blackguardly. He had in fact reached the district which, in\r\nspite of the efforts of its inhabitants to get it called Lower\r\nBelgravia, is still known as Pimlico. And it was near the beginning of\r\nLupus Street that he was roused from his meditations by the sight of a\r\ncoffee-stall.\r\n\r\nIt brought him up standing. Once more he had suddenly become aware of\r\nthat gnawing hunger which had afflicted him outside the oyster\r\nrestaurant. Why he should be hungry, seeing that not so many hours ago\r\nhe had consumed an ample dinner, he could not have said. A\r\npsychologist, had one been present, would have told him that the pangs\r\nof starvation from which he supposed himself to suffer were purely a\r\nfigment of the mind, and that it was merely his subconscious self\r\nreacting to the suggestion of food. Sam, however, had positive inside\r\ninformation to the contrary; and he halted before the coffee-stall,\r\nstaring wolfishly.\r\n\r\nThere was not a large attendance of patrons. Three only were present.\r\nOne was a man in a sort of uniform who seemed to have been cleaning\r\nstreets, the two others had the appearance of being gentlemen of\r\nleisure. They were leaning restfully on the counter, eating hard-boiled\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nSam eyed them resentfully. It was just this selfish sort of\r\nepicureanism, he felt, that was the canker which destroyed empires. And\r\nwhen the man in uniform, wearying of eggs, actually went on to\r\nsupplement them with a slice of seedcake, it was as if he were watching\r\nthe orgies that preceded the fall of Babylon. With gleaming eyes he drew\r\na step closer, and was thus enabled to overhear the conversation of\r\nthese sybarites.\r\n\r\nLike all patrons of coffee-stalls, they were talking about the Royal\r\nfamily, and for a brief space it seemed that a perfect harmony was to\r\nprevail. Then the man in uniform committed himself to the statement that\r\nthe Duke of York wore a moustache, and the gentlemen of leisure united\r\nto form a solid opposition.\r\n\r\n“’E ain’t got no moustache,” said one.\r\n\r\n“Cert’n’ly ’e ain’t got no moustache,” said the other.\r\n\r\n“Wot,” inquired the first gentleman of leisure, “made you get that\r\nsilly idea into your ’ead that ’e’s got a moustache?”\r\n\r\n“’E’s got a smorl clipped moustache,” said the man in uniform stoutly.\r\n\r\n“A smorl clipped moustache?”\r\n\r\n“A smorl clipped moustache.”\r\n\r\n“You say he’s got a smorl clipped moustache?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! A smorl clipped moustache.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said the leader of the opposition, with the air of a\r\ncross-examining counsel who has dexterously trapped a reluctant witness\r\ninto a damaging admission, “that’s where you make your ruddy error.\r\nBecause ’e ain’t got no smorl clipped moustache.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Sam that a little adroit diplomacy at this point would be\r\nin his best interests. He had not the pleasure of the duke’s\r\nacquaintance and so was not really entitled to speak as an expert, but\r\nhe decided to support the man in uniform. The good graces of a fellow of\r\nhis careless opulence were worth seeking. In a soaring moment of\r\noptimism it seemed to him that a hard-boiled egg and a cup of coffee\r\nwere the smallest reward a loyal supporter might expect. He advanced\r\ninto the light of the naphtha flare and spoke with decision.\r\n\r\n“This gentleman is right,” he said. “The Duke of York has a small\r\nclipped moustache.”\r\n\r\nThe interruption appeared to come on the three debaters like a\r\nbombshell. It had on them an effect much the same as an uninvited\r\nopinion from a young and newly joined member would have on a group of\r\nbishops and generals in the smoking-room of the Athenæum Club. For an\r\ninstant there was a shocked silence; then the man in uniform spoke.\r\n\r\n“Wot do you want, stickin’ your ugly fat ’ead in?” he demanded coldly.\r\n\r\nShakespeare, who knew too much ever to be surprised at man’s\r\ningratitude, would probably have accepted this latest evidence of it\r\nwith stoicism. It absolutely stunned Sam. A little peevishness from the\r\ntwo gentlemen of leisure he had expected, but that his sympathy and\r\nsupport should be received in this fashion by the man in uniform was\r\nsimply disintegrating. It seemed to be his fate to-night to lack appeal\r\nfor men in uniform.\r\n\r\n“Yus,” agreed the leader of the opposition, “’oo arsked you to shove\r\nin?”\r\n\r\n“Comin’ stickin’ ’is ’ead in!” sniffed the man in uniform.\r\n\r\nAll three members of the supper party eyed him with manifest disfavour.\r\nThe proprietor of the stall, a silent hairy man, said nothing: but he,\r\ntoo, cast a chilly glance of hauteur in Sam’s direction. There was a\r\nsense of strain.\r\n\r\n“I only said----” Sam began.\r\n\r\n“And ’oo arsked you to?” retorted the man in uniform.\r\n\r\nThe situation was becoming difficult. At this tense moment, however,\r\nthere was a rattling and a grinding of brakes and a taxicab drew up at\r\nthe kerb, and out of its interior shot Mr. Willoughby Braddock.\r\n\r\n“Getta cuppa coffee,” observed Mr. Braddock explanatorily to the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\nA FRIEND IN NEED\r\n\r\n\r\nOf certain supreme moments in life it is not easy to write. The workaday\r\nteller of tales, whose gifts, if any, lie rather in the direction of\r\nrecording events than of analysing emotion, finds himself baffled by\r\nthem. To say that Sam Shotter was relieved by this sudden reappearance\r\nof his old friend would obviously be inadequate. Yet it is hard to find\r\nwords that will effectually meet the case. Perhaps it is simplest to say\r\nthat his feelings at this juncture were to all intents and purposes\r\nthose of the garrison besieged by savages in the final reel of a\r\nmotion-picture super-super-film when the operator flashes on the screen\r\nthe subtitle, “Hurrah! Here come the United States Marines!”\r\n\r\nAnd blended with this heart-shaking thankfulness, came instantaneously\r\nthe thought that he must not let the poor fish get away again.\r\n\r\n“Here, I say!” said Mr. Braddock, becoming aware of a clutching hand\r\nupon his coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, Bradder, old man,” said Sam. “It’s only me.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Me.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Sam Shotter.”\r\n\r\n“Sam Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“Sam Shotter.”\r\n\r\n“Sam Shotter who used to be at school with me?”\r\n\r\n“The very same.”\r\n\r\n“Are you Sam Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“Why, so you are!” said Mr. Braddock, completely convinced. He displayed\r\nthe utmost delight at this re-union. “Mosestraornary coincidence,” he\r\nsaid as he kneaded Sam lovingly about the shoulder. “I was talking to a\r\nfellow in the Strand about you only an hour ago.”\r\n\r\n“Were you, Bradder, old man?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; nasty ugly-looking fellow. I bumped into him, and he turned round\r\nand the very first thing he said was, ‘Do you know Sam Shotter?’ He told\r\nme all sorts of interesting things about you too--all sorts of\r\ninteresting things. I’ve forgotten what they were, but you see what I\r\nmean.”\r\n\r\n“I follow you perfectly, Bradder. What’s become of your hat?”\r\n\r\nA look of relieved happiness came in to Willoughby Braddock’s face.\r\n\r\n“Have you got my hat? Where is it?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t got your hat.”\r\n\r\n“You said you had my hat.”\r\n\r\n“No, I didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Mr. Braddock, disappointed. “Well, then, come and have a\r\ncuppa coffee.”\r\n\r\nIt was with the feelings of a voyager who after much buffeting comes\r\nsafely at last to journey’s end that Sam ranged himself alongside the\r\ncounter which for so long had been but a promised land seen from some\r\ndistant Mount Pisgah. The two gentlemen of leisure had melted away into\r\nthe night, but the uniformed man remained, eating seedcake with a touch\r\nof bravado.\r\n\r\n“This gentleman a friend of yours, Sam?” asked Mr. Braddock, having\r\nordered coffee and eggs.\r\n\r\n“I should say not,” said Sam with aversion. “Why, he thinks the Duke of\r\nYork has a small clipped moustache!”\r\n\r\n“No!” said Mr. Braddock, shocked.\r\n\r\n“He does.”\r\n\r\n“Man must be a thorough ass.”\r\n\r\n“Dropped on his head when a baby, probably.”\r\n\r\n“Better have nothing to do with him,” said Mr. Braddock in a\r\nconfidential bellow.\r\n\r\nThe meal proceeded on its delightful course. Sam had always been fond of\r\nWilloughby Braddock, and the spacious manner in which he now ordered\r\nfurther hard-boiled eggs showed him that his youthful affection had not\r\nbeen misplaced. A gentle glow began to steal over him. The coffee was\r\nthe kind of which, after a preliminary mouthful, you drink a little more\r\njust to see if it is really as bad as it seemed at first, but it was\r\nwarm and comforting. It was not long before the world appeared very good\r\nto Sam. He expanded genially. He listened with courteous attention to\r\nMr. Braddock’s lengthy description of his speech at the Old Wrykynian\r\ndinner, and even melted sufficiently to extend an olive branch to the\r\nman in uniform.\r\n\r\n“Looks like rain,” he said affably.\r\n\r\n“Who does?” asked Mr. Braddock, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“I was addressing the gentleman behind you,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock looked cautiously over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“But are we speaking to him?” he asked gravely. “I thought----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Sam tolerantly. “I fancy he’s quite a good fellow\r\nreally. Wants knowing, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think he looks like rain?” asked Mr. Braddock,\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur of the taxicab now added himself to their little group. He\r\nsaid that he did not know about Mr. Braddock’s plans, but that he\r\nhimself was desirous of getting to bed. Mr. Braddock patted him on the\r\nshoulder with radiant bonhomie.\r\n\r\n“This,” he explained to Sam, “is a most delightful chap. I’ve forgotten\r\nhis name.”\r\n\r\nThe cabman said his name was Evans.\r\n\r\n“Evans! Of course. I knew it was something beginning with a G. This is\r\nmy friend Evans, Sam. I forget where we met, but he’s taking me home.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you live, Bradder?”\r\n\r\n“Where do I live, Evans?”\r\n\r\n“Down at Valley Fields, you told me,” said the cabman.\r\n\r\n“Where are you living, Sam?”\r\n\r\n“Nowhere.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean--nowhere?”\r\n\r\n“I have no home,” said Sam with simple pathos.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to dig you one,” said the man in uniform.\r\n\r\n“No home?” cried Mr. Braddock, deeply moved. “Nowhere to sleep to-night,\r\ndo you mean? I say, look here, you must absolutely come back with me.\r\nEvans, old chap, do you think there would be room for one more in that\r\ncab of yours? Because I particularly want this gentleman to come back\r\nwith me. My dear old Sam, I won’t listen to any argument.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t have to.”\r\n\r\n“You can sleep on the sofa in the drawing-room. You ready, Evans, old\r\nman? Splendid! Then let’s go.”\r\n\r\nFrom Lupus Street, Pimlico, to Burberry Road, Valley Fields, is a\r\ndistance of several miles, but to Sam the drive seemed a short one. This\r\nillusion was not due so much to the gripping nature of Mr. Braddock’s\r\nconversation, though that rippled on continuously, as to the fact that,\r\nbeing a trifle weary after his experiences of the night, he dozed off\r\nshortly after they had crossed the river. He awoke to find that the cab\r\nhad come to a standstill outside a wooden gate which led by a short\r\ngravel path to a stucco-covered house. A street lamp, shining feebly,\r\nwas strong enough to light up the name San Rafael. Mr. Braddock paid the\r\ncabman and ushered Sam through the gate. He produced a key after a\r\nlittle searching, and having mounted the steps opened the door. Sam\r\nfound himself in a small hall, dimly lighted by a turned-down jet of\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n“Go right in,” said Mr. Braddock. “I’ll be back in a moment. Got to see\r\na man.”\r\n\r\n“Got to what?” said Sam, surprised.\r\n\r\n“Got to see a man for a minute. Fellow named Evans, who was at school\r\nwith me. Most important.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that curious snipelike abruptness which characterised his\r\nmovements to-night, Willoughby Braddock slammed the front door violently\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nSam’s feelings, as the result of his host’s impulsive departure, were\r\nsomewhat mixed. To the credit side of the ledger he could place the fact\r\nthat he was safely under the shelter of a roof, which he had not\r\nexpected to be an hour ago; but he wished that, before leaving, his\r\nfriend had given him a clew as to where was situated this drawing-room\r\nwith its sofa whereon he was to spend the remainder of the night.\r\n\r\nHowever, a brief exploration would no doubt reveal the hidden chamber.\r\nIt might even be that room whose door faced him across the hall.\r\n\r\nHe was turning the handle with the view of testing this theory, when a\r\nvoice behind him, speaking softly but with a startling abruptness, said,\r\n“Hands up!”\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stairs, her wide mouth set in a determined line, her\r\ntow-coloured hair adorned with gleaming curling pins, there was standing\r\na young woman in a pink dressing gown and slippers. In her right hand,\r\npointed at his head, she held a revolver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\nSAM AT SAN RAFAEL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not given to every girl who makes prophecies to find those\r\nprophecies fulfilled within a few short hours of their utterance; and\r\nthe emotions of Claire Lippett, as she confronted Sam in the hall of San\r\nRafael, were akin to those of one who sees the long shot romp in ahead\r\nof the field or who unexpectedly solves the cross-word puzzle. Only that\r\nevening she had predicted that burglars would invade the house, and here\r\none was, as large as life. Mixed, therefore, with her disapproval of\r\nthis midnight marauder, was a feeling almost of gratitude to him for\r\nbeing there. Of fear she felt no trace. She presented the pistol with a\r\nfirm hand.\r\n\r\nOne calls it a pistol for the sake of technical accuracy. To Sam’s\r\nstartled senses it appeared like a young cannon, and so deeply did he\r\nfeel regarding it that he made it the subject of his opening\r\nremark--which, by all the laws of etiquette, should have been a graceful\r\napology for and explanation of his intrusion.\r\n\r\n“Steady with the howitzer!” he urged.\r\n\r\n“What say?” said Claire coldly.\r\n\r\n“The lethal weapon--be careful with it. It’s pointing at me.”\r\n\r\n“I know it’s pointing at you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, so long as it only points,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe felt a good deal reassured by the level firmness of her tone. This\r\nwas plainly not one of those neurotic, fluttering females whose fingers\r\ncannot safely be permitted within a foot of a pistol trigger.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Claire, still keeping the weapon poised, turned the\r\ngas up. Upon which, Sam, rightly feeling that the ball of conversation\r\nshould be set rolling by himself, spoke again.\r\n\r\n“You are doubtless surprised,” he said, plagiarising the literary style\r\nof Mr. Todhunter, “to see me here.”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not?”\r\n\r\n“No. You keep those hands of yours up.”\r\n\r\nSam sighed.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t speak to me in that harsh tone,” he said, “if you knew all\r\nI had been through. It is not too much to say that I have been\r\npersecuted this night.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you shouldn’t come breaking into people’s houses,” said Claire\r\nprimly.\r\n\r\n“You are labouring under a natural error,” said Sam. “I did not break\r\ninto this charming little house. My presence, Mrs. Braddock, strange as\r\nit may seem, is easily explained.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you calling Mrs. Braddock?”\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you Mrs. Braddock?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You aren’t married to Mr. Braddock?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not.”\r\n\r\nSam was a broad-minded young man.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well,” he said, “in the sight of God, no doubt----”\r\n\r\n“I’m the cook.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Sam, relieved, “that explains it.”\r\n\r\n“Explains what?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, it seemed a trifle odd for a moment that you should be\r\npopping about here at this time of night with your hair in curlers and\r\nyour little white ankles peeping out from under a dressing gown.”\r\n\r\n“Coo!” said Claire in a modest flutter. She performed a swift adjustment\r\nof the garment’s folds.\r\n\r\n“But if you’re Mr. Braddock’s cook----”\r\n\r\n“Who said I was Mr. Braddock’s cook?”\r\n\r\n“You did.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t any such thing. I’m Mr. Wrenn’s cook.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. who?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wrenn.”\r\n\r\nThis was a complication which Sam had not anticipated.\r\n\r\n“Let us get this thing straight,” he said. “Am I to understand that this\r\nhouse does not belong to Mr. Braddock?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are. It belongs to Mr. Wrenn.”\r\n\r\n“But Mr. Braddock had a latchkey.”\r\n\r\n“He’s staying here.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean--ah?”\r\n\r\n“I intended to convey that things are not so bad as I thought they were.\r\nI was afraid for a moment that I had got into the wrong house. But it’s\r\nall right. You see, I met Mr. Braddock a short while ago and he brought\r\nme back here to spend the night.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” said Claire. “Did he? Ho! Oh, indeed?”\r\n\r\nSam looked at her anxiously. He did not like her manner.\r\n\r\n“You believe me, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“But surely----”\r\n\r\n“If Mr. Braddock brought you here, where is he?”\r\n\r\n“He went away. He was, I regret to say, quite considerably squiffed.\r\nImmediately after letting me in he dashed off, banging the door behind\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Likely!”\r\n\r\n“But listen, my dear little girl----”\r\n\r\n“Less of it!” said Claire austerely. “It’s a bit thick if a girl can’t\r\ncatch a burglar without having him start to flirt with her.”\r\n\r\n“You wrong me!” said Sam. “You wrong me! I was only saying----”\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t.”\r\n\r\n“But this is absurd. Good heavens, use your intelligence! If my story\r\nwasn’t true, how could I know anything about Mr. Braddock?”\r\n\r\n“You could easily have asked around. What I say is if you were all right\r\nyou wouldn’t be going about in a suit of clothes like that. You look\r\nlike a tramp.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve just come off a tramp steamer. You mustn’t go judging people\r\nby appearance. I should have thought they would have taught you that at\r\nschool.”\r\n\r\n“Never you mind what they taught me at school.”\r\n\r\n“You have got me all wrong. I’m a millionaire--or rather my uncle is.”\r\n\r\n“Mine’s the Shah of Persia.”\r\n\r\n“And a few weeks ago he sent me over to England, the idea being that I\r\nwas to sail on the _Mauretania_. But that would have involved sharing a\r\nsuite with a certain Lord Tilbury and the scheme didn’t appeal to me. So\r\nI missed the ship and came over on a cargo boat instead.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. He had an uncomfortable feeling that the story sounded thin.\r\nHe passed it in a swift review before his mind. Yes, thin.\r\n\r\nAnd it was quite plain from her expression that the resolute young lady\r\nbefore him shared this opinion.\r\n\r\nShe wrinkled her small nose skeptically, and, having finished wrinkling\r\nit, sniffed.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe a word of it,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid you wouldn’t,” said Sam. “True though it is, it has a\r\nphony ring. Really to digest that story, you have to know Lord Tilbury.\r\nIf you had the doubtful pleasure of the acquaintance of that king of\r\nbores, you would see that I acted in the only possible way. However, if\r\nit’s too much for you, let it go, and we will approach the matter from a\r\nnew angle. The whole trouble seems to be my clothes, so I will make you\r\na sporting offer. Overlook them for the moment, give me your womanly\r\ntrust and allow me to sleep on the drawing-room sofa for the rest of the\r\nnight, and not only will blessings reward you but I promise you--right\r\nhere and now--that in a day or two I will call at this house and let you\r\nsee me in the niftiest rig-out that ever man wore. Imagine it! A\r\nbrand-new suit, custom-made, silk serge linings, hand-sewed, scallops on\r\nthe pocket flaps--and me inside! Is it a bet?”\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Think well! When you first see that suit you will say to yourself that\r\nthe coat doesn’t seem to sit exactly right. You will be correct. The\r\ncoat will not sit exactly right. And why? Because there will be in the\r\nside pocket a large box of the very finest mixed chocolates, a present\r\nfor a good girl. Come now! The use of the drawing-room for the few\r\nremaining hours of the night. It is not much to ask.”\r\n\r\nClaire shook her head inflexibly.\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to risk it,” she said. “By rights I ought to march you\r\nout into the street and hand you over to the policeman.”\r\n\r\n“And have him see you in curling pins? No, no!”\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with my curling pins?” demanded Claire fiercely.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing,” said Sam hastily. “I admire them. It only occurred\r\nto me as a passing thought----”\r\n\r\n“The reason I don’t do it is because I’m tender-hearted and don’t want\r\nto be too hard on a feller.”\r\n\r\n“It is a spirit I appreciate,” said Sam. “And would that there had been\r\nmore of it abroad in London this night.”\r\n\r\n“So out you go, and don’t let me hear no more of you. Just buzz off,\r\nthat’s all I ask. And be quick about it, because I need my sleep.”\r\n\r\n“I was wrong about those chocolates,” said Sam. “Silly mistake to make.\r\nWhat will really be in that side pocket will be a lovely diamond\r\nbrooch.”\r\n\r\n“And a motor car and a ruby ring and a new dress and a house in the\r\ncountry, I suppose. Outside!”\r\n\r\nSam accepted defeat. The manly spirit of the Shotters was considerable,\r\nbut it could be broken.\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right, I’ll go. One of these days, when my limousine splashes\r\nyou with mud, you will be sorry for this.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t bang the door behind you,” ordered the ruthless girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\nSAM AT MON REPOS\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding on the steps and gazing out into the blackness, Sam now\r\nperceived that in the interval between his entrance into San Rafael and\r\nhis exit therefrom, the night, in addition to being black, had become\r\nwet. A fine rain had begun to fall, complicating the situation to no\r\nsmall extent.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes he remained where he was, hoping for Mr. Braddock’s\r\nreturn. But the moments passed and no sound of footsteps, however\r\ndistant, broke the stillness; so, after going through a brief\r\ncommination service in which the names of Hash Todhunter, Claude Bates\r\nand Willoughby Braddock were prominently featured, he decided to make a\r\nmove. And it was as he came down from the steps on to the little strip\r\nof gravel that he saw a board leaning drunkenly towards him a few paces\r\nto his left, and read on that board the words “To Let, Furnished.”\r\n\r\nThis opened up an entirely new train of thought. It revealed to him what\r\nhe had not previously suspected, that the house outside which he stood\r\nwas not one house but two houses. It suggested, moreover, that the one\r\nto which the board alluded was unoccupied, and the effect of this was\r\nextraordinarily stimulating.\r\n\r\nHe hurried along the gravel; and rounding the angle of the building,\r\nsaw dimly through the darkness a structure attached to its side which\r\nlooked like a conservatory. He bolted in; and with a pleasant feeling of\r\nhaving circumvented Fate, sat down on a wooden shelf intended as a\r\nresting place for potted geraniums.\r\n\r\nBut Fate is not so easily outmanœuvred. Fate, for its own inscrutable\r\nreasons, had decided that Sam was to be thoroughly persecuted to-night,\r\nand it took up the attack again without delay. There was a sharp\r\ncracking sound and the wooden shelf collapsed in ruin. Sam had many\r\nexcellent qualities, but he did not in the least resemble a potted\r\ngeranium, and he went through the woodwork as if it had been paper. And\r\nFate, which observes no rules of the ring and has no hesitation about\r\nhitting a man when he is down, immediately proceeded to pour water down\r\nhis neck through a hole in the broken roof.\r\n\r\nSam rose painfully. He saw now that he had been mistaken in supposing\r\nthat this conservatory was a home from home. He turned up his coat\r\ncollar and strode wrathfully out into the darkness. He went round to the\r\nback of the house with the object of ascertaining if there was an\r\noutside coal cellar where a man might achieve dryness, if not positive\r\ncomfort. And it was as he stumbled along that he saw the open window.\r\n\r\nIt was a sight which in the blackness of the night he might well have\r\nmissed; but suffering had sharpened his senses, and he saw it\r\nplainly--an open window only a few feet above the ground. Until this\r\nmoment the idea of actually breaking into the house had not occurred to\r\nhim; but now, regardless of all the laws which discourage such\r\nbehaviour, he put his hand on the sill and scrambled through. The rain,\r\nas if furious at the escape of its prey, came lashing down like a shower\r\nbath.\r\n\r\nSam moved carefully on. Groping his way, he found himself at the foot of\r\na flight of stairs. He climbed these cautiously and became aware of\r\ndoors to left and right.\r\n\r\nThe room to the right was empty, but the other one contained a bed. It\r\nwas a bed, however, that had been reduced to such a mere scenario that\r\nhe decided to leave it and try his luck downstairs. The board outside\r\nhad said “To Let, Furnished,” which suggested the possibility of a\r\ndrawing-room sofa. He left the room and started to walk down the stairs.\r\n\r\nAt first, as he began the descent, the regions below had been in\r\ncomplete darkness. But now a little beam of light suddenly pierced the\r\ngloom--a light that might have been that of an electric torch. It was\r\nwavering uncertainly, as if whoever was behind it was in the grip of a\r\nstrong emotion of some kind.\r\n\r\nSam also was in the grip of a strong emotion. He stopped and held his\r\nbreath. For the space of some seconds there was silence. Then he\r\nbreathed again.\r\n\r\nPerfect control of the breathing apparatus is hard to acquire. Singers\r\nspend years learning it. Sam’s skill in that direction was rudimentary.\r\nIt had been his intention to let his present supply of breath gently out\r\nand then, very cautiously, to take another supply gently in. Instead of\r\nwhich, he gave vent to a sound so loud and mournful that it made his\r\nflesh creep. It was half a snort and half a groan, and it echoed\r\nthrough the empty house like a voice from the tomb.\r\n\r\nThis, he felt, was the end. Further concealment was obviously out of the\r\nquestion. Dully resentful of the curse that seemed to be on him\r\nto-night, he stood waiting for the inevitable challenge from below.\r\n\r\nNo challenge came. Instead, there was a sharp clatter of feet, followed\r\nby a distant scrabbling sound. The man behind the torch had made a rapid\r\nexit through the open window.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Sam stood perplexed. Then the reasonable explanation came\r\nto him. It was no caretaker who had stood there, but an intruder with as\r\nlittle right to be on the premises as he himself. And having reached\r\nthis conclusion, he gave no further thought to the matter. He was\r\nfeeling extraordinarily sleepy now and speculations as to the identity\r\nof burglars had no interest for him. His mind was occupied entirely by\r\nthe question of whether or not there was a sofa in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThere was, and a reasonably comfortable sofa too. Sam had reached the\r\nstage where he could have slept on spikes, and this sofa seemed to him\r\nas inviting as the last word in beds, with all the latest modern springs\r\nand box mattresses. He lay down and sleep poured over him like a healing\r\nwave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST FOR ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight when he woke. Splashes of sunlight were on the\r\nfloor, and outside a cart clattered cheerfully. Rising stiffly, he was\r\naware of a crick in the neck and of that unpleasant sensation of\r\nsemi-suffocation which comes to those who spend the night in a disused\r\nroom with the windows closed. More even than a bath and a shave, he\r\ndesired fresh air. He made his way down the passage to the window by\r\nwhich he had entered. Outside, glimpses of a garden were visible. He\r\nclimbed through and drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\nThe rain of the night had left the world sweet and clean. The ragged\r\ngrass was all jewelled in the sunshine, and birds were singing in the\r\ntrees. Sam stood drinking in the freshness of it all, feeling better\r\nevery instant.\r\n\r\nFinally, having performed a few of those bending and stretching\r\nexercises which form such an admirable corrective to the effects of a\r\ndisturbed night, he strolled down the garden path, wishing he could\r\nsomehow and at no very distant date connect with a little breakfast.\r\n\r\n“For goodness sake!”\r\n\r\nHe looked up. Over the fence which divided the garden from the one next\r\ndoor a familiar face was peering. It was his hostess of last night.\r\nBut, whereas then she had been curling-pinned and dressing-gowned, she\r\nwas now neatly clad in print and wore on her head a becoming cap. Her\r\nface, moreover, which had been hard and hostile, was softened by a\r\nfriendly grin.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“How did you get there?”\r\n\r\n“When you turned me out into the night,” said Sam reproachfully, “I took\r\nrefuge next door.”\r\n\r\n“I say, I’m sorry about that,” said the girl remorsefully. “But how was\r\nI to know that you were telling the truth?” She giggled happily. “Mr.\r\nBraddock came back half an hour after you had left. He made such a rare\r\nold row that I came down again----”\r\n\r\n“And shot him, I hope. No? A mistake, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, he asked where you were. He said your name was Evans.”\r\n\r\n“He was a little confused. My name is Shotter. I warned you that he was\r\nnot quite himself. What became of him then?”\r\n\r\n“He went up to bed. I’ve just taken him up a tray, but all he did was to\r\nlook at it and moan and shut his eyes again. I say, have you had any\r\nbreakfast?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t torture me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, hop over the fence then. I’ll get you some in two ticks.”\r\n\r\nSam hopped. The sun seemed very bright now, and the birds were singing\r\nwith a singular sweetness.\r\n\r\n“Would it also run to a shave and a bath?” he asked, as they walked\r\ntoward the house.\r\n\r\n“You’ll find Mr. Wrenn’s shaving things in the bathroom.”\r\n\r\n“Is this heaven?” said Sam. “Shall I also find Mr. Wrenn by any chance?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, him and Miss Kay have been gone half an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent! Where is this bathroom?”\r\n\r\n“Up those stairs, first door to the left. When you come down, go into\r\nthat room there, and I’ll bring the tray in. It’s the drawing-room, but\r\nthe dining-room table isn’t cleared yet.”\r\n\r\n“I shall enjoy seeing your drawing-room, of which I have heard so much.”\r\n\r\n“Do you like eggs?”\r\n\r\n“I do--and plenty of them. Also bacon--a good deal of bacon. Oh, and by\r\nthe way----” added Sam, leaning over the banisters.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“----toast--lots and lots of toast.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll get you all you can eat.”\r\n\r\n“You will? Tell me,” said Sam, “it has been puzzling me greatly. How do\r\nyou manage to get that dress on over your wings?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\nSAM FINDS A PHOTOGRAPH\r\n\r\n\r\nSam, when he came downstairs some twenty minutes later, was definitely\r\nin what Mr. Hash Todhunter would have described as the pink. The night\r\nhad been bad, but joy had certainly come in the morning. The sight of\r\nthe breakfast tray on a small table by the window set the seal on his\r\nmood of well-being; and for a long, luxurious space he had eyes for\r\nnothing else. It was only after he had consumed the eggs, the bacon, the\r\ntoast, the coffee and the marmalade that he yielded to what is usually\r\nthe first impulse of a man who finds himself in a strange room and began\r\nto explore.\r\n\r\nIt was some half minute later that Claire Lippett, clearing the\r\ndining-room table, was startled to the extent of dropping a butter dish\r\nby a loud shout or cry that seemed to proceed from the room where she\r\nhad left her guest.\r\n\r\nHurrying thither, she found him behaving in a strange manner. He was\r\npointing at a photograph on the mantelpiece and gesticulating wildly.\r\n\r\n“Who’s that?” he cried as she entered. He seemed to have difficulty with\r\nhis vocal cords.\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“Who the devil’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Language!”\r\n\r\n“Who is it? That girl--who is she? What’s her name?”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t shout,” said Claire, annoyed.\r\n\r\nThe photograph which had so excited this young man was the large one\r\nthat stood in the centre of the mantelpiece. It represented a girl in\r\nhunting costume, standing beside her horse, and it was Claire’s\r\nfavourite. A dashing and vigorous duster, with an impressive record of\r\nsmashed china and broken glass to her name, she always handled this\r\nparticular work of art with a gentle tenderness.\r\n\r\n“That?” she said. “Why, that’s Miss Kay, of course.”\r\n\r\nShe came forward and flicked a speck of dust off the glass.\r\n\r\n“Taken at Midways, that was,” she said, “two or three years ago, before\r\nthe old colonel lost his money. I was Miss Kay’s maid then--personal\r\nmaid,” she added with pride. She regarded the photograph wistfully, for\r\nit stood to her for all the pomps and glories of a vanished yesterday,\r\nfor the brave days when there had been horses and hunting costumes and\r\nold red chimneys against a blue sky and rabbits in the park and sunlight\r\non the lake and all the rest of the things that made up Midways and\r\nprosperity. “I remember the day that photograph was took. It was printed\r\nin the papers, that photograph was.”\r\n\r\nSam continued to be feverish.\r\n\r\n“Miss Kay? Who’s Miss Kay?”\r\n\r\n“Miss Kay Derrick, Mr. Wrenn’s niece.”\r\n\r\n“The man who lives here, do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He gave Miss Kay a home when everything went smash. That’s how I\r\ncome to be here. I could have stopped at Midways if I’d of liked,” she\r\nsaid. “The new people who took the place would have kept me on if I’d of\r\nwanted. But I said, ‘No,’ I said. ‘I’m going with Miss Kay,’ I said.\r\n‘I’m not going to desert her in her mis-for-chewn,’ I said.”\r\n\r\nSam started violently.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean--you can’t mean--you don’t mean she lives here?”\r\n\r\n“Of course she does.”\r\n\r\n“Not actually lives here--not in this very house?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“My gosh!”\r\n\r\nSam quivered from head to foot. A stupendous idea had come to him.\r\n\r\n“My gosh!” he cried again, with bulging eyes. Then, with no more\r\nwords--for it was a time not for words but for action--he bounded from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nTo leap out of the front door and clatter down the steps to the board\r\nwhich stood against the fence was with Sam the work of a moment. Beneath\r\nthe large letters of the To Let, Furnished, he now perceived other\r\nsmaller letters informing all who might be interested that applications\r\nfor the tenancy of that desirable semi-detached residence, Mon Repos,\r\nshould be made to Messrs. Matters & Cornelius, House Agents, of Ogilvy\r\nStreet, Valley Fields, S. E. He galloped up the steps again and beat\r\nwildly upon the door.\r\n\r\n“Now what?” inquired Claire.\r\n\r\n“Where is Ogilvy Street?”\r\n\r\n“Up the road, first turning to the left.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\n“You’re welcome.”\r\n\r\nOut on the gravel, he paused, pondered and returned.\r\n\r\n“Back again?” said Claire.\r\n\r\n“Did you say left or right?”\r\n\r\n“Left.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it,” said Claire.\r\n\r\nThis time Sam performed the descent of the steps in a single leap. But\r\nreaching the gate, he was struck by a thought.\r\n\r\n“Fond of exercise, aren’t you?” said Claire patiently.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly occurred to me,” explained Sam, “that I’d got no money.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want me to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“These house-agent people would expect a bit of money down in advance,\r\nwouldn’t they?”\r\n\r\n“Sounds possible. Are you going to take a house?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to take Mon Repos,” said Sam. “And I must have money. Where’s\r\nMr. Braddock?”\r\n\r\n“In bed.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s his room?”\r\n\r\n“Top floor back.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\n“Dee-lighted,” said Claire.\r\n\r\nHer statement that the guest of the house was in bed proved accurate.\r\nSam, entering the apartment indicated, found his old school friend lying\r\non his back with open mouth and matted hair. He was snoring\r\nrhythmically. On a chair at his side stood a tray containing a teapot,\r\ntoast and a cold poached egg of such raffish and leering aspect that\r\nSam, moving swiftly to the dressing table, averted his eyes as he\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThe dressing table presented an altogether more pleasing picture. Heaped\r\nbeside Mr. Braddock’s collar box and hair-brushes was a small mountain\r\nof notes and silver--a fascinating spectacle with the morning sunshine\r\nplaying on them. With twitching fingers, Sam scooped them up; and\r\nfinding pencil and paper, paused for a moment, seeking for words.\r\n\r\nIt is foolish to attempt to improve on the style of a master. Hash\r\nTodhunter had shown himself in a class of his own at this kind of\r\nliterary composition, and Sam was content to take him as a model. He\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     “DEAR BRADDER: You will doubtless be surprised to learn that I have\r\n     borrowed your money. I will return it in God’s good time.\r\n     Meanwhile, as Sir Philip Sidney said to the wounded soldier, my\r\n     need is greater than yours.\r\n\r\n     “Trusting this finds you in the pink,\r\n\r\n                            “Yrs. Obedtly,\r\n\r\n                             “S. SHOTTER.”\r\n\r\nThen, having propped the note against the collar box, he left the room.\r\n\r\nA sense of something omitted, some little kindly act forgotten, arrested\r\nhim at the head of the stairs. He returned; and taking the poached egg,\r\nplaced it gently on the pillow beside his friend’s head. This done, he\r\nwent downstairs again, and so out on the broad trail that led to the\r\npremises of Messrs. Matters & Cornelius, House Agents, of Ogilvy\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\nSAM BECOMES A HOUSEHOLDER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Matters would have thought of Sam as he charged breezily into\r\nthe office a few minutes later we shall never know, for Mr. Matters died\r\nin the year 1910. Mr. Cornelius thought him perfectly foul. After one\r\nswift, appraising stare through his gold-rimmed spectacles, he went so\r\nfar as to share this opinion with his visitor.\r\n\r\n“I never give to beggars,” he said. He was a venerable old man with a\r\nwhite beard and bushy eyebrows, and he spoke with something of the\r\nintonation of a druid priest chanting at the altar previous to sticking\r\nthe knife into the human sacrifice. “I do not believe in indiscriminate\r\ncharity.”\r\n\r\n“I will fill in your confession book some other time,” said Sam. “For\r\nthe moment, let us speak of houses. I want to take Mon Repos in Burberry\r\nRoad.”\r\n\r\nThe druid was about to recite that ancient rune which consists of the\r\nsolemn invocation to a policeman, when he observed with considerable\r\nsurprise that his young visitor was spraying currency in great\r\nquantities over the table. He gulped. It was unusual for clients at his\r\noffice to conduct business transactions in a manner more suitable to the\r\nBagdad of the _Arabian Nights_ than a respectable modern suburb. He\r\ncould hardly have been more surprised if camels laden with jewels and\r\nspices had paraded down Ogilvy Street.\r\n\r\n“What is all this?” he asked, blinking.\r\n\r\n“Money,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get it?”\r\n\r\nHe eyed Sam askance. And Sam, who, as the heady result of a bath, shave,\r\nbreakfast and the possession of cash, had once more forgotten that there\r\nwas anything noticeable about his appearance, gathered that here was\r\nanother of the long line of critics who had failed to recognise his true\r\nworth at first sight.\r\n\r\n“Do not judge me by the outer crust,” he said. “I am shabby because I\r\nhave been through much. When I stepped aboard the boat at New York I was\r\nas natty a looking young fellow as you could wish to see. People nudged\r\none another as I passed along the pier and said, ‘Who is he?’”\r\n\r\n“You come from America?”\r\n\r\n“From America.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Mr. Cornelius, as if that explained everything.\r\n\r\n“My uncle,” said Sam, sensing the change in the atmosphere and pursuing\r\nhis advantage, “is Mr. John B. Pynsent, the well-to-do millionaire of\r\nwhom you have doubtless heard.... You haven’t? One of our greatest\r\ncaptains of industry. He made a vast fortune in fur.”\r\n\r\n“In fur? Really?”\r\n\r\n“Got the concession for providing the snakes at the Bronx Zoo with\r\nearmuffs, and from that moment never looked back.”\r\n\r\n“You surprise me,” said Mr. Cornelius. “Most interesting.”\r\n\r\n“A romance of commerce,” agreed Sam. “And now, returning to this matter\r\nof the house----”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” said Mr. Cornelius. His voice, as he eyed the money on the\r\ntable, was soft and gentle. He still looked like a druid priest, but a\r\ndruid priest on his afternoon off. “For how long a period did you wish\r\nto rent Mon Repos, Mr.--er----”\r\n\r\n“Shotter is the name.... Indefinitely.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we say three months rent in advance?”\r\n\r\n“Let us say just those very words.”\r\n\r\n“And as to references----”\r\n\r\nSam was on the point of giving Mr. Wrenn’s name, until he recollected\r\nthat he had not yet met that gentleman. Using his shaving brush and\r\nrazor and eating food from his larder seemed to bring them very close\r\ntogether. He reflected.\r\n\r\n“Lord Tilbury,” he said. “That’s the baby.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Tilbury, of the Mammoth Publishing Company?” said Mr. Cornelius,\r\nplainly awed. “Do you know him?”\r\n\r\n“Know him? We’re more like brothers than anything. There’s precious\r\nlittle Lord Tilbury ever does without consulting me. It might be a good\r\nidea to call him up on the phone now. I ought to let him know that I’ve\r\narrived.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cornelius turned to the telephone, succeeded after an interval in\r\ngetting the number, and after speaking with various unseen underlings,\r\ntottered reverently as he found himself talking to the great man in\r\nperson. He handed the instrument to Sam.\r\n\r\n“His Lordship would like to speak to you, Mr. Shotter.”\r\n\r\n“I knew it, I knew it,” said Sam. “Hello! Lord Tilbury? This is Sam. How\r\nare you? I’ve just arrived. I came over in a tramp steamer, and I’ve\r\nbeen having all sorts of adventures. Give you a good laugh. I’m down at\r\nValley Fields at the moment, taking a house. I’ve given your name as a\r\nreference. You don’t mind? Splendid! Lunch? Delighted. I’ll be along as\r\nsoon as I can. Got to get a new suit first. I slept in my clothes last\r\nnight.... Well, good-bye. It’s all right about the references,” he said,\r\nturning to Mr. Cornelius. “Carry on.”\r\n\r\n“I will draw up the lease immediately, Mr. Shotter. If you will tell me\r\nwhere I am to send it----”\r\n\r\n“Send it?” said Sam surprised. “Why, to Mon Repos, of course.”\r\n\r\n“But----”\r\n\r\n“Can’t I move in at once?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so, if you wish it. But I fancy the house is hardly ready for\r\nimmediate tenancy. You will need linen.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right. A couple of hours shopping will fix that.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cornelius smiled indulgently. He was thoroughly pro-Sam by now.\r\n\r\n“True American hustle,” he observed, waggling his white beard. “Well, I\r\nsee no objection, if you make a point of it. I will find the key for\r\nyou. Tell me, Mr. Shotter,” he asked as he rummaged about in drawers,\r\n“what has caused this great desire on your part to settle in Valley\r\nFields? Of course, as a patriotic inhabitant, I ought not to be\r\nsurprised. I have lived in Valley Fields all my life, and would not live\r\nanywhere else if you offered me a million pounds.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t.”\r\n\r\n“I was born in Valley Fields, Mr. Shotter, and I love the place, and I\r\nam not ashamed to say so.\r\n\r\n“‘Breathes there the man with soul so dead,’” inquired Mr. Cornelius,\r\n“‘Who never to himself hath said, This is my own, my native land! Whose\r\nheart hath ne’er within him burned as home his footsteps he hath turn’d\r\nfrom wandering on a foreign strand?’”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Sam. “That’s what we’d all like to know, wouldn’t we?”\r\n\r\n“‘If such there breathe,’” proceeded Mr. Cornelius, “‘go mark him well!\r\nFor him no minstrel raptures swell. High though his titles, proud his\r\nname, boundless his wealth as wish can claim, despite those titles,\r\npower, and pelf, the wretch, concentred all in self----’”\r\n\r\n“I have a luncheon engagement at 1:30,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“‘----Living, shall forfeit fair renown, and, doubly dying, shall go\r\ndown to the vile dust from whence he sprung, unwept, unhonour’d and\r\nunsung.’ Those words, Mr. Shotter----”\r\n\r\n“A little thing of your own?”\r\n\r\n“Those words, Mr. Shotter, will appear on the title page of the history\r\nof Valley Fields, which I am compiling--a history dealing not only with\r\nits historical associations, which are numerous, but also with those\r\naspects of its life which my occupation as house agent has given me\r\npeculiar opportunities of examining. I get some queer clients, Mr.\r\nShotter.”\r\n\r\nSam was on the point of saying that the clients got a queer house agent,\r\nthus making the thing symmetrical, but he refrained.\r\n\r\n“It may interest you to know that a very well-known criminal, a man who\r\nmight be described as a second Charles Peace, once resided in the very\r\nhouse which you are renting.”\r\n\r\n“I shall raise the tone.”\r\n\r\n“Like Charles Peace, he was a most respectable man to all outward\r\nappearances. His name was Finglass. Nobody seems to have had any\r\nsuspicion of his real character until the police, acting on information\r\nreceived, endeavoured to arrest him for the perpetration of a great bank\r\nrobbery.”\r\n\r\n“Catch him?” said Sam, only faintly interested.\r\n\r\n“No; he escaped and fled the country. But I was asking you what made you\r\nsettle on Valley Fields as a place of residence. You would seem to have\r\nmade up your mind very quickly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the fact is, I happened to catch sight of my next-door\r\nneighbours, and it struck me that they would be pleasant people to live\r\nnear.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cornelius nodded.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wrenn is greatly respected by all who know him.”\r\n\r\n“I liked his razor,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“If you are going to Tilbury House it is possible that you may meet him.\r\nHe is the editor of Pyke’s _Home Companion_.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?” said Sam. “Pyke’s _Home Companion_, eh?”\r\n\r\n“I take it in regularly.”\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Wrenn’s niece? A charming girl, I thought.”\r\n\r\n“I scarcely know her,” said Mr. Cornelius indifferently. “Young women do\r\nnot interest me.”\r\n\r\nThe proverb about casting pearls before swine occurred to Sam.\r\n\r\n“I must be going,” he said coldly. “Speed up that lease, will you. And\r\nif anyone else blows in and wants to take the house, bat them over the\r\nhead with the office ruler.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wrenn and I frequently play a game of chess together,” said Mr.\r\nCornelius.\r\n\r\nSam was not interested in his senile diversions.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” he said stiffly, and passed out into Ogilvy Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\nSAM IS MUCH TOO SUDDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clocks of London were striking twelve when Sam, entering the Strand,\r\nturned to the left and made his way toward Fleet Street to keep his\r\ntryst with Lord Tilbury at the offices of the Mammoth Publishing\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nIn the interval which had elapsed since his parting from Mr. Cornelius a\r\nstriking change had taken place in his appearance, for he had paid a\r\nvisit to that fascinating shop near Covent Garden which displays on its\r\ndoor the legend, “Cohen Bros., Ready-Made Clothiers,” and is the Mecca\r\nof all who prefer to pluck their garments ripe off the bough instead of\r\nwaiting for them to grow. The kindly brethren had fitted him out with a\r\ntweed suit of bold pattern, a shirt of quality, underclothing, socks, a\r\ncollar, sock suspenders, a handkerchief, a tie pin and a hat with the\r\nsame swift and unemotional efficiency with which, had he desired it,\r\nthey would have provided the full costume of an Arctic explorer, a duke\r\nabout to visit Buckingham Palace, or a big-game hunter bound for Eastern\r\nAfrica. Nor had they failed him in the matter of new shoes and a\r\nwanghee. It was, in short, an edition de luxe of S. Pynsent Shotter,\r\nrichly bound and profusely illustrated, that now presented itself to the\r\nnotice of the public.\r\n\r\nThe tonic of new clothes is recognised by all students of human nature.\r\nSam walked with a springy jauntiness, and his gay bearing, combined with\r\nthe brightness of his exterior, drew many eyes upon him.\r\n\r\nTwo of these eyes belonged to a lean and stringy man of mournful\r\ncountenance who was moving in the opposite direction, away from London’s\r\nnewspaper land. For a moment they rested upon Sam in a stare that had\r\nsomething of dislike in it, as if their owner resented the intrusion\r\nupon his notice of so much cheerfulness. Then they suddenly widened into\r\na stare of horror, and the man stopped, spellbound. A hurrying\r\npedestrian, bumping into him from behind, propelled him forward, and\r\nSam, coming up at four miles an hour, bumped into him in front. The\r\nresult of the collision was a complicated embrace, from which Sam was\r\nextricating himself with apologies when he perceived that this person\r\nwith whom he had become entangled was no stranger, but an old friend.\r\n\r\n“Hash!” he cried.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in Mr. Todhunter’s aspect to indicate pleasure at the\r\nencounter. He breathed heavily and spoke no word.\r\n\r\n“Hash, you old devil!” said Sam joyfully.\r\n\r\nMr. Todhunter licked his lips uncomfortably. He cast a swift glance over\r\nhis shoulder, as if debating the practicability of a dive into the\r\ntraffic. He endeavoured, without success, to loosen the grip of Sam’s\r\nhand on his coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n“What are you wriggling for?” asked Sam, becoming aware of this.\r\n\r\n“I’m not wriggling,” said Hash. He spoke huskily and in a tone that\r\nseemed timidly ingratiating. If the voice of Mr. Cornelius had resembled\r\na druid priest’s, Clarence Todhunter’s might have been likened to that\r\nof the victim on the altar. “I’m not wriggling, Sam. What would I want\r\nto wriggle for?”\r\n\r\n“Where did you spring from, Hash?”\r\n\r\nMr. Todhunter coughed.\r\n\r\n“I was just coming from leaving a note for you, Sam, at that place\r\nTilbury House, where you told me you’d be.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a great letter writer, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\nThe allusion was not lost upon Mr. Todhunter. He gulped and his\r\nbreathing became almost stertorous.\r\n\r\n“I want to explain about that, Sam,” he said. “Explain, if I may use the\r\nterm, fully. Sam,” said Mr. Todhunter thickly, “what I say and what I\r\nalways have said is, when there’s been a little misunderstanding between\r\npals--pals, if I may use the expression, what have stood together side\r\nby side through thick and through thin--pals what have shared and shared\r\nalike----” He broke off. He was not a man of acute sensibility, but he\r\ncould see that the phrase, in the circumstances, was an unhappy one.\r\n“What I say is, Sam, when it’s like that--well, there’s nothing like\r\nletting bygones be bygones and, so to speak, burying the dead past. As a\r\nman of the world, you bein’ one and me bein’ another----”\r\n\r\n“I take it,” said Sam, “from a certain something in your manner, that\r\nthat moth-eaten whippet of yours did not win his race.”\r\n\r\n“Sam,” said Mr. Todhunter, “I will not conceal it from you. I will be\r\nfrank, open and above board. That whippet did not win.”\r\n\r\n“Your money then--and mine--is now going to support some bookie in the\r\nstyle to which he has been accustomed?”\r\n\r\n“It’s gorn, Sam,” admitted Mr. Todhunter in a deathbed voice. “Yes, Sam,\r\nit’s gorn.”\r\n\r\n“Then come and have a drink,” said Sam cordially.\r\n\r\n“A drink?”\r\n\r\n“Or two.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way to a hostelry that lurked coyly among shops and office\r\nbuildings. Hash followed, marvelling. The first stunned horror had\r\npassed, and his mind, such as it was, was wrestling with the insoluble\r\nproblem of why Sam, with the facts of the whippet disaster plainly\r\nbefore him, was so astoundingly amiable.\r\n\r\nThe hour being early even for a perpetually thirsty community like that\r\nof Fleet Street, the saloon bar into which they made their way was free\r\nfrom the crowds which would have interfered with a quiet chat between\r\nfriends. Two men who looked like printers were drinking beer in a\r\ncorner, while at the counter a haughty barmaid was mixing a cocktail for\r\na solitary reveller in a velours hat. This individual had just made a\r\nremark about the weather in a rich and attractive voice, and his\r\nintonation was so unmistakably American that Sam glanced at him as he\r\npassed; and, glancing, half stopped, arrested by something strangely\r\nfamiliar about the man’s face.\r\n\r\nIt was not a face which anyone would be likely to forget if they had\r\nseen it often; and the fact that it brought no memories back to him\r\ninclined Sam to think that he could never have met this rather\r\nstriking-looking person, but must have seen him somewhere on the street\r\nor in a hotel lobby. He was a handsome, open-faced man of middle-age.\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen that fellow before somewhere,” he said, as he sat with Hash\r\nat a table by the window.\r\n\r\n“’Ave you?” said Hash, and there was such a manifest lack of interest in\r\nhis tone that Sam, surprised at his curtness, awoke to the realisation\r\nthat he had not yet ordered refreshment. He repaired the omission and\r\nHash’s drawn face relaxed.\r\n\r\n“Hash,” said Sam, “I owe you a lot.”\r\n\r\n“Me?” said Hash blankly.\r\n\r\n“Yes. You remember that photograph I showed you?”\r\n\r\n“The girl--Nimrod?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Hash, I’ve found her, and purely owing to you. If you hadn’t taken\r\nthat money it would never have happened.”\r\n\r\nMr. Todhunter, though he was far from understanding, endeavoured to\r\nassume a simper of modest altruism. He listened attentively while Sam\r\nrelated the events of the night.\r\n\r\n“And I’ve taken the house next door,” concluded Sam, “and I move in\r\nto-day. So, if you want a shore job, the post of cook in the Shotter\r\nhousehold is open. How about it?”\r\n\r\nA sort of spasm passed across Hash’s wooden features.\r\n\r\n“You want me to come and cook?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got to get a cook somewhere. Can you leave the ship?”\r\n\r\n“Can I leave the ship? Mister, you watch and see how quick I can leave\r\nthat ruddy ocean-going steam kettle! I’ve been wanting a shore job ever\r\nsince I was cloth-head enough to go to sea.”\r\n\r\n“You surprise me,” said Sam. “I have always looked on you as one of\r\nthose tough old salts who can’t be happy away from deep waters. I\r\nthought you sang chanteys in your sleep. Well, that’s splendid. You had\r\nbetter go straight down to the house and start getting things fixed up.\r\nHere’s the key. Write the address down--Mon Repos, Burberry Road, Valley\r\nFields.”\r\n\r\nA sharp crash rang through the room. The man at the bar, who had\r\nfinished his cocktail and was drinking a whisky and soda, had dropped\r\nhis glass.\r\n\r\n“’Ere!” exclaimed the barmaid, startled, a large hand on the left side\r\nof her silken bosom.\r\n\r\nThe man paid no attention to her cry. He was staring with marked\r\nagitation at Sam and his companion.\r\n\r\n“How do I get there?” asked Hash.\r\n\r\n“By train or bus--there’s any number of ways.”\r\n\r\n“And I can go straight into the house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I’ve taken it from this morning.”\r\n\r\nSam hurried out. Hash, pausing to write down the address, became aware\r\nthat he was being spoken to.\r\n\r\n“Say, pardon me,” said the fine-looking man who was clutching at his\r\nsleeve. “Might I have a word with you, brother?”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Hash suspiciously. The last time an American had addressed\r\nhim as brother it had cost him eleven dollars and seventy-five cents.\r\n\r\n“Did I understand your pal who’s gone out to say that he had rented a\r\nhouse named Mon Repos down in Valley Fields?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you did. What of it?”\r\n\r\nThe man did not reply. Consternation was writ upon his face, and he\r\npassed a hand feebly across his broad forehead. The silence was broken\r\nby the cold voice of the barmaid.\r\n\r\n“That’ll be threepence I’ll kindly ask you for, for that glass,” said\r\nthe barmaid. “And if,” she added with asperity, “you ’ad to pay for the\r\nshock you give me, it ’ud cost you a tenner.”\r\n\r\n“Girlie,” replied the man sadly, watching Hash as he shambled through\r\nthe doorway, “you aren’t the only one that’s had a shock.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nWhile Sam was walking down Fleet Street on his way to Tilbury House,\r\nthrilled with the joy of existence and swishing the air jovially with\r\nhis newly purchased wanghee, in Tilbury House itself the proprietor of\r\nthe Mammoth Publishing Company was pacing the floor of his private\r\noffice, his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, his eyes staring\r\nbleakly before him.\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury was a short, stout, commanding-looking man, and practically\r\neverything he did had in it something of the Napoleonic quality. His\r\ndemeanour now suggested Napoleon in captivity, striding the deck of the\r\n_Bellerophon_ with vultures gnawing at his breast.\r\n\r\nSo striking was his attitude that his sister, Mrs. Frances Hammond, who\r\nhad called to see him, as was her habit when business took her into the\r\nneighbourhood of Tilbury House, paused aghast in the doorway, while the\r\nobsequious boy in buttons who was ushering her in frankly lost his nerve\r\nand bolted.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious, Georgie!” she cried. “What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nHis Lordship came to a standstill and something faintly resembling\r\nrelief appeared in his square-cut face. Ever since the days when he had\r\nbeen plain George Pyke, starting in business with a small capital and a\r\nlarge ambition, his sister Frances had always been a rock of support. It\r\nmight be that her advice would help him to cope with the problem which\r\nwas vexing him now.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Francie,” he said. “Thank goodness you’ve come. Just the\r\nperson I want to talk to.”\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong?”\r\n\r\n“I’m telling you. You remember that when I was in America I met a man\r\nnamed Pynsent?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“This man Pynsent was the owner of an island off the coast of Maine.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. And you----”\r\n\r\n“An island,” continued Lord Tilbury, “densely covered with trees. He\r\nused it merely as a place of retirement, for the purpose of shooting and\r\nfishing; but when he invited me there for a week-end I saw its\r\ncommercial possibilities in an instant.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you told me. You----”\r\n\r\n“I said to myself,” proceeded Lord Tilbury, one of whose less engaging\r\npeculiarities it was that he never permitted the fact that his audience\r\nwas familiar with a story to keep him from telling it again, “I said to\r\nmyself, ‘This island, properly developed, could supply all the paper the\r\nMammoth needs and save me thousands a year!’ It was my intention to buy\r\nthe place and start paper mills.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and----”\r\n\r\n“Paper mills,” said Lord Tilbury firmly. “I made an offer to Pynsent. He\r\nshilly-shallied. I increased my offer. Still he would give me no\r\ndefinite answer. Sometimes he seemed willing to sell, and then he would\r\nchange his mind. And then, when I was compelled to leave and return to\r\nEngland, an idea struck me. He had been talking about his nephew and how\r\nhe was anxious for him to settle down and do something----”\r\n\r\n“So you offered to take him over here and employ him in the Mammoth,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Hammond with a touch of impatience. She loved and revered her\r\nbrother, but she could not conceal it from herself that he sometimes\r\ntended to be prolix. “You thought it would put him under an obligation.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. I imagined I was being shrewd. I supposed that I was\r\nintroducing into the affair just that little human touch which sometimes\r\nmakes all the difference. Well, it will be a bitter warning to me never\r\nagain to be too clever. Half the business deals in this world are ruined\r\nby one side or the other trying to be too clever.”\r\n\r\n“But, George, what has happened? What is wrong?”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury resumed his patrol of the carpet.\r\n\r\n“I’m telling you. It was all arranged that he should sail back with me\r\non the _Mauretania_, but when the vessel left he was nowhere to be\r\nfound. And then, about the second day out, I received a wireless message\r\nsaying, ‘Sorry not to be with you. Coming _Araminta_. Love to all.’ I\r\ncould not make head or tail of it.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mrs. Hammond thoughtfully; “it is very puzzling. I think it\r\nmay possibly have meant----”\r\n\r\n“I know what it meant--now. The solution,” said Lord Tilbury bitterly,\r\n“was vouchsafed to me only an hour ago by the boy himself.”\r\n\r\n“Has he arrived then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he has arrived. And he travelled on a tramp steamer.”\r\n\r\n“A tramp steamer! But why?”\r\n\r\n“Why? Why? How should I know why? Last night, he informed me, he slept\r\nin his clothes.”\r\n\r\n“Slept in his clothes? Why?”\r\n\r\n“How should I know why? Who am I to analyse the motives of a boy who\r\nappears to be a perfect imbecile?”\r\n\r\n“But have you seen him?”\r\n\r\n“No. He rang up on the telephone from the office of a house agent in\r\nValley Fields. He has taken a house there and wished to give my name as\r\na reference.”\r\n\r\n“Valley Fields? Why Valley Fields?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t keep on saying why,” cried Lord Tilbury tempestuously. “Haven’t I\r\ntold you a dozen times that I don’t know why--that I haven’t the least\r\nidea why?”\r\n\r\n“He does seem an eccentric boy.”\r\n\r\n“Eccentric? I feel as if I had allowed myself to be saddled with the\r\nguardianship of a dancing dervish. And when I think that if this young\r\nidiot gets into any sort of trouble while he is under my charge, Pynsent\r\nis sure to hold me responsible. I could kick myself for ever having been\r\nfool enough to bring him over here.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t blame yourself, Georgie.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a question of blaming myself. It’s a question of Pynsent\r\nblaming me and getting annoyed and breaking off the deal about the\r\nisland.”\r\n\r\nAnd Lord Tilbury, having removed his thumbs from the armholes of his\r\nwaistcoat in order the more freely to fling them heavenwards, uttered a\r\ncomplicated sound which might be rendered phonetically by the word\r\n“Cor!” tenser and more dignified than the “Coo!” of the lower-class\r\nLondoner, but expressing much the same meaning.\r\n\r\nIn the hushed silence which followed, the buzzer on the desk sounded.\r\n\r\n“Yes? Eh? Oh, send him up.” Lord Tilbury laid down the instrument and\r\nturned to his sister grimly. “Shotter is downstairs,” he said. “Now you\r\nwill be able to see him for yourself.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hammond’s first impression when she saw Sam for herself was that\r\nshe had been abruptly confronted with something in between a cyclone and\r\na large Newfoundland puppy dressed in bright tweeds. Sam’s mood of\r\nelation had grown steadily all the way down Fleet Street, and he burst\r\ninto the presence of his future employer as if he had just been let off\r\na chain.\r\n\r\n“Well, how are you?” he cried, seizing Lord Tilbury’s hand in a grip\r\nthat drew from him a sharp yelp of protest.\r\n\r\nThen, perceiving for the first time the presence of a fair stranger, he\r\nmoderated his exuberance somewhat and stared politely.\r\n\r\n“My sister, Mrs. Hammond,” said Lord Tilbury, straightening his fingers.\r\n\r\nSam bowed. Mrs. Hammond bowed.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I had better leave you,” said Mrs. Hammond. “You will want to\r\ntalk.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t go,” said Sam hospitably.\r\n\r\n“I have business in Lombard Street,” said Mrs. Hammond, discouraging\r\nwith a cold look what seemed to her, rightly or wrongly, a disposition\r\non the part of this young man to do the honours and behave generally as\r\nif he were trying to suggest that Tilbury House was his personal\r\nproperty but that any relative of Lord Tilbury was welcome there. “I\r\nhave to visit my bank.”\r\n\r\n“I shall have to visit mine pretty soon,” said Sam, “or the wolf will be\r\nscratching at the door.”\r\n\r\n“If you are short of funds----” began Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m all right for the present, thanks. I pinched close on fifty\r\npounds from a man this morning.”\r\n\r\n“You did what?” said Lord Tilbury blankly.\r\n\r\n“Pinched fifty pounds. Surprising he should have had so much on him. But\r\nlucky--for me.”\r\n\r\n“Did he make any objection to your remarkable behaviour?”\r\n\r\n“He was asleep at the time, and I didn’t wake him. I just left a poached\r\negg on his pillow and came away.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury swallowed convulsively and his eye sought that of Mrs.\r\nHammond in a tortured glare.\r\n\r\n“A poached egg?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“So that he would find it there when he woke,” explained Sam.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hammond had abandoned her intention of withdrawing and leaving the\r\ntwo men together for a cosy chat. Georgie, it seemed to her from his\r\nexpression, needed a woman’s loving support. Sam appeared to have\r\naffected him like some unpleasant drug, causing starting of the eyes and\r\ntwitching of the muscles.\r\n\r\n“It is a pity you missed the _Mauretania_, Mr. Shotter,” she said. “My\r\nbrother had hoped that you would travel with him so that you could have\r\na good talk about what you were to do when you joined his staff.”\r\n\r\n“Great pity,” said Sam, omitting to point out that it was for that very\r\nreason that he had allowed the _Mauretania_ to depart without him.\r\n“However, it’s all right. I have found my niche.”\r\n\r\n“You have done what?”\r\n\r\n“I have selected my life work.” He pulled out of his pocket a crumpled\r\npaper. “I would like to attach myself to Pyke’s _Home Companion_. I\r\nbought a copy on my way here, and it is the goods. You aren’t reading\r\nthe serial by any chance, are you--_Hearts Aflame_, by Cordelia Blair? A\r\nwinner. I only had time to glance at the current instalment, but it was\r\nenough to make me decide to dig up the back numbers at the earliest\r\npossible moment. In case you haven’t read it, it is Leslie Mordyke’s\r\nwedding day, and a veiled woman with a foreign accent has just risen in\r\nthe body of the church and forbidden the banns. And,” said Sam warmly,\r\n“I don’t blame her. It appears that years ago----”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury was making motions of distress, and Mrs. Hammond bent\r\nsolicitously, like one at a sick bed, to catch his fevered whisper.\r\n\r\n“My brother,” she announced, “wishes----”\r\n\r\n“----was hoping,” corrected Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\n“----was hoping,” said Mrs. Hammond, accepting the emendation, “that\r\nyou would join the staff of the _Daily Record_ so that you might be\r\nunder his personal eye.”\r\n\r\nSam caught Lord Tilbury’s personal eye, decided that he had no wish to\r\nbe under it and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The _Home Companion_,” said Lord Tilbury, coming to life, “is a very\r\nminor unit of my group of papers.”\r\n\r\n“Though it has a large circulation,” said Mrs. Hammond loyally.\r\n\r\n“A very large circulation, of course,” said Lord Tilbury; “but it offers\r\nlittle scope for a young man in your position, anxious to start on a\r\njournalistic career. It is not--how shall I put it?--it is not a vital\r\npaper, not a paper that really matters.”\r\n\r\n“In comparison with my brother’s other papers,” said Mrs. Hammond.\r\n\r\n“In comparison with my other papers, of course.”\r\n\r\n“I think you are wrong,” said Sam. “I cannot imagine a nobler life work\r\nfor any man than to help produce Pyke’s _Home Companion_. Talk about\r\nspreading sweetness and light, why, Pyke’s _Home Companion_ is the paper\r\nthat wrote the words and music. Listen to this; ‘A. M. B. (Brixton). You\r\nask me for a simple and inexpensive method of curing corns. Get an\r\nordinary swede, or turnip, cut and dig out a hole in the top, fill the\r\nhole with common salt and allow to stand till dissolved. Soften the corn\r\nmorning and night with this liquid.’”\r\n\r\n“Starting on the reportorial staff of the _Daily Record_,” said Lord\r\nTilbury, “you would be in a position----”\r\n\r\n“Just try to realise what that means,” proceeded Sam. “What it amounts\r\nto is that the writer of that paragraph has with a stroke of the pen\r\nmade the world a better place. He has brightened a home. Possibly he has\r\naverted serious trouble between man and wife. A. M. B. gets the ordinary\r\nswede, digs out the top, pushes in the salt, and a week later she has\r\nceased to bully her husband and beat the baby and is a ray of sunshine\r\nabout the house--and all through Pyke’s _Home Companion_.”\r\n\r\n“What my brother means----” said Mrs. Hammond.\r\n\r\n“Similarly,” said Sam, “with G. D. H. (Tulse Hill), who wants to know\r\nhow to improve the flavour of prunes. You or I would say that the\r\nflavour of prunes was past praying for, that the only thing to do when\r\ncornered by a prune was to set your teeth and get it over with. Not so\r\nPyke’s----”\r\n\r\n“He means----”\r\n\r\n“----_Home Companion._ ‘A little vinegar added to stewed prunes,’ says\r\nthe writer, ‘greatly improves the flavour. And although it may seem\r\nstrange, it causes less sugar to be used.’ What happens? What is the\r\nresult? G. D. H.’s husband comes back tired and hungry after a day’s\r\nwork. ‘Prunes for dinner again, I suppose?’ he says moodily. ‘Yes,\r\ndear,’ replies G. D. H., ‘but of a greatly improved flavour.’ Well, he\r\ndoesn’t believe her, of course. He sits down sullenly. Then, as he\r\ndeposits the first stone on his plate, a delighted smile comes into his\r\nface. ‘By Jove!’ he cries. ‘The flavour is greatly improved. They still\r\ntaste like brown paper soaked in machine oil, but a much superior grade\r\nof brown paper. How did you manage it?’ ‘It was not I, dearest,’ says G.\r\nD. H., ‘but Pyke’s _Home Companion_. Acting on their advice, I added a\r\nlittle vinegar, with the result that not only is the flavour greatly\r\nimproved but, strange though it may seem, I used less sugar.’ ‘Heaven\r\nbless Pyke’s _Home Companion_!’ cries the husband. With your permission\r\nthen,” said Sam, “I will go straight to Mr. Wrenn and inform him that I\r\nhave come to fight the good fight under his banner. ‘Mr. Wrenn,’ I shall\r\nsay----”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury was perplexed.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Wrenn? How do you know Wrenn?”\r\n\r\n“I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting him, but we are next-door\r\nneighbours. I have taken the house adjoining his. Mon Repos, Burberry\r\nRoad, is the address. You can see for yourself how convenient this will\r\nbe. Not only shall we toil all day in the office to make Pyke’s _Home\r\nCompanion_ more and more of a force among the _intelligentsia_ of Great\r\nBritain but in the evenings, as we till our radishes, I shall look over\r\nthe fence and say, ‘Wrenn,’ and Wrenn will say, ‘Yes, Shotter?’ And I\r\nshall say, ‘Wrenn, how would it be to run a series on the eradication of\r\npimples in canaries?’ ‘Shotter,’ he will reply, dropping his spade in\r\nhis enthusiasm, ‘this is genius. ’Twas a lucky day, boy, for the old\r\n_Home Companion_ when you came to us.’ But I am wasting time. I should\r\nbe about my business. Good-bye, Mrs. Hammond. Good-bye, Lord Tilbury.\r\nDon’t trouble to come with me. I will find my way.”\r\n\r\nHe left the room with the purposeful step of the man of affairs, and\r\nLord Tilbury uttered a sound which was almost a groan.\r\n\r\n“Insane!” he ejaculated. “Perfectly insane!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hammond, womanlike, was not satisfied with simple explanation.\r\n\r\n“There is something behind this, George!”\r\n\r\n“And I can’t do a thing,” moaned His Lordship, chafing, as your strong\r\nman will, against the bonds of fate. “I simply must humour this boy, or\r\nthe first thing I know he will be running off on some idiotic prank and\r\nPynsent will be sending me cables asking why he has left me.”\r\n\r\n“There is something behind this,” repeated Mrs. Hammond weightily. “It\r\nstands to reason. Even a boy like this young Shotter would not take a\r\nhouse next door to Mr. Wrenn the moment he landed unless he had some\r\nmotive. George, there is a girl at the bottom of this.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury underwent a sort of minor convulsion. His eyes bulged and\r\nhe grasped the arms of his chair.\r\n\r\n“Good God, Francie! Don’t say that! Pynsent took me aside before I left\r\nand warned me most emphatically to be careful how I allowed this boy to\r\ncome in contact with--er--members of the opposite sex.”\r\n\r\n“Girls,” said Mrs. Hammond.\r\n\r\n“Yes, girls,” said Lord Tilbury, as if pleasantly surprised at this neat\r\nway of putting it. “He said he had had trouble a year or so ago----”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wrenn must have a daughter,” said Mrs. Hammond, pursuing her train\r\nof thought. “Has Mr. Wrenn a daughter?”\r\n\r\n“How the devil should I know?” demanded His Lordship, not unnaturally\r\nirritated. “I don’t keep in touch with the home life of every man in\r\nthis building.”\r\n\r\n“Ring him up and ask him.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t. I don’t want my staff to think I’ve gone off my head. Besides,\r\nyou may be quite wrong.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be extremely surprised if I am,” said Mrs. Hammond.\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury sat gazing at her pallidly. He knew that Francie had a\r\nsixth sense in these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nAt about the moment when Sam entered the luxuriously furnished office of\r\nthe Mammoth Publishing Company’s proprietor and chief, in a smaller and\r\nless ornate room in the same building Mr. Matthew Wrenn, all unconscious\r\nof the good fortune about to descend upon him in the shape of the\r\naddition to his staff of a live and go-ahead young assistant, was seated\r\nat his desk, busily engaged in promoting the best interests of that\r\nwidely read weekly, Pyke’s _Home Companion_. He was, in fact, correcting\r\nthe proofs of an article--ably written, but too long to quote\r\nhere--entitled What a Young Girl Can Do in Her Spare Time; Number 3, Bee\r\nKeeping.\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted in this task by the opening of the door, and looking\r\nup, was surprised to see his niece, Kay Derrick.\r\n\r\n“Why, Kay!” said Mr. Wrenn. She had never visited him at his office so\r\nearly as this, for Mrs. Winnington-Bates expected her serfs to remain on\r\nduty till at least four o’clock. In her blue eyes, moreover, there was a\r\nstrange glitter that made him subtly uneasy. “Why, Kay, what are you\r\ndoing here?”\r\n\r\nKay sat down on the desk. Having ruffled his grizzled hair with an\r\naffectionate hand, she remained for a while in silent meditation.\r\n\r\n“I hate young men!” she observed at length. “Why isn’t everyone nice and\r\nold--I mean elderly, but frightfully well preserved, like you, darling?”\r\n\r\n“Is anything the matter?” asked Mr. Wrenn anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Nothing much. I’ve left Mrs. Bates.”\r\n\r\n“I’m very glad to hear it, my dear. There is no earthly reason why you\r\nshould have to waste your time slaving----”\r\n\r\n“You’re worse than Claire,” said Kay, her eyes ceasing to glitter. “You\r\nboth conspire to coddle me. I’m young and strong, and I ought to be\r\nearning my living. But,” she went on, tapping his head with her finger\r\nto emphasise her words, “I will not continue in a job which involves\r\nbeing kissed by worms like Claude Bates. No, no, no, sir!”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn raised a shocked and wrathful face.\r\n\r\n“He kissed you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You had an article in the _Home Companion_ last week, uncle,\r\nsaying what a holy and beautiful thing the first kiss is. Well, Claude\r\nBates’ wasn’t. He hadn’t shaved and he was wearing a dressing gown.\r\nAlso, he was pallid and greenish, and looked as if he had been out all\r\nnight. Anything less beautiful and holy I never saw.”\r\n\r\n“He kissed you! What did you do?”\r\n\r\n“I hit him very hard with a book which I was taking to read to Mrs.\r\nBates. It was the Rev. Aubrey Jerningham’s _Is There a Hell?_ and I’ll\r\nbet Claude thought there was. Until then I had always rather disliked\r\nMrs. Bates’ taste in literature, which shows how foolish I was. If she\r\nhad preferred magazines, where would I have been? There were about six\r\nhundred pages of Aubrey Jerningham, bound in stiff cloth, and he blacked\r\nClaude’s eye like a scholar and a gentleman. And at that moment in came\r\nMrs. Bates.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Mr. Wrenn, enthralled.\r\n\r\n“Well, a boy’s best friend is his mother. Have you ever seen one of\r\nthose cowboy films where there is trouble in the bar-room? It was like\r\nthat. Mrs. Bates started to dismiss me, but I got in first with my\r\nresignation, shooting from the hip, as it were. And then I came away,\r\nand here I am.”\r\n\r\n“The fellow should be horsewhipped,” said Mr. Wrenn, breathing heavily.\r\n\r\n“He isn’t worth bothering about,” said Kay.\r\n\r\nThe riot of emotion into which she had been plunged by the addresses of\r\nthe unshaven Bates had puzzled her. But now she understood. It was\r\ngalling to suppose so monstrous a thing, but the explanation was, she\r\nfelt, that there had been condescension in his embrace. If she had been\r\nMiss Derrick of Midways, he would not have summoned up the nerve to\r\nkiss her in a million years; but his mother’s secretary and companion\r\nhad no terror for him. And at the thought a deep thrill of gratitude to\r\nthe Rev. Aubrey Jerningham passed through Kay. How many a time, wearied\r\nby his duties about the parish, must that excellent clergyman have been\r\ntempted to scamp his work and shirk the labour of adding that extra\r\ncouple of thousand words which just make all the difference to\r\nliterature when considered in the light of a missile.\r\n\r\nBut he had been strong. He had completed his full six hundred pages and\r\nseen to it that his binding had been heavy and hard and sharp about the\r\nedges. For a moment, as she sat there, the Rev. Aubrey Jerningham seemed\r\nto Kay the one bright spot in a black world.\r\n\r\nShe was still meditating upon him when there was a hearty smack on the\r\ndoor and Sam came in.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, good morning,” he said cheerily.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw Kay, and on the instant his eyes widened into a goggling\r\nstare, his mouth fell open, his fingers clutched wildly at nothing, and\r\nhe stood there, gaping.\r\n\r\nKay met his stare with a defiant eye. In her present mood she disliked\r\nall young men, and there seemed nothing about this one to entitle him to\r\nexemption from her loathing. Rather, indeed, the reverse, for his\r\nappearance jarred upon her fastidious taste.\r\n\r\nIf the Cohen Bros., of Covent Garden, have a fault, it is that they\r\nsometimes allow their clients to select clothes that are a shade too\r\nprismatic for anyone who is not at the same time purchasing a banjo and\r\na straw hat with a crimson ribbon. Fittings take place in a dimly lit\r\ninterior, with the result that suits destined to make phlegmatic horses\r\nshy in the open street seem in the shop to possess merely a rather\r\npleasing vivacity. One of these Sam had bought, and it had been a\r\nblunder on his part. If he had intended to sing comic songs from a punt\r\nat Henley Regatta, he would have been suitably, even admirably, attired.\r\nBut as a private gentleman he was a little on the bright side. He\r\nlooked, in fact, like a bookmaker who won billiard tournaments, and Kay\r\ngazed upon him with repulsion.\r\n\r\nHe, on the other hand, gazed at her with a stunned admiration. That\r\nphotograph should have prepared him for something notable in the way of\r\nfeminine beauty; but it seemed to him, as he raked her with eyes like\r\nsmall dinner plates, that it had been a libel, an outrage, a gross\r\ncaricature. This girl before him was marvellous. Helen of Troy could\r\nhave been nothing to her. He loved her shining eyes, unaware that they\r\nshone with loathing. He worshipped her rose-flushed cheeks, not knowing\r\nthat they were flushed because he had been staring at her for\r\nthirty-three seconds without blinking and she was growing restive\r\nbeneath his gaze.\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n“Did you want anything?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“What?” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“Is there anything I can do for you?”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn approached the matter from a fresh angle.\r\n\r\n“This is the office of Pyke’s _Home Companion_. I am Mr. Wrenn, the\r\neditor. Did you wish to see me?”\r\n\r\n“Who?” said Sam.\r\n\r\nAt this point Kay turned to the window, and the withdrawal of her eyes\r\nhad the effect of releasing Sam from his trance. He became aware that a\r\ngrey-haired man, whom he dimly remembered having seen on his entry into\r\nthe room some hours before, was addressing him.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“You wished to see me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sam; “yes, yes.”\r\n\r\n“What about?” asked Mr. Wrenn patiently.\r\n\r\nThe directness and simplicity of the question seemed to clear Sam’s\r\nhead. He recalled now what it was that had brought him here.\r\n\r\n“I’ve come over from America to join the staff of Pyke’s _Home\r\nCompanion_.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Lord Tilbury wants me to.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Tilbury?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I’ve just been seeing him.”\r\n\r\n“But he has said nothing to me about this, Mr.----”\r\n\r\n“----Shotter. No, we only arranged it a moment ago.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn was a courteous man, and though he was under the impression\r\nthat his visitor was raving, he did not show it.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I had better see Lord Tilbury,” he suggested, rising. “By the\r\nway, my niece, Miss Derrick. Kay, my dear, Mr. Shotter.”\r\n\r\nThe departure of the third party and the sudden institution of the\r\nintimacies of a _tête-à-tête_ had the usual effect of producing a\r\nmomentary silence. Then Kay moved away from the window and came to the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n“Did you say you had come from America?” she asked, fiddling with Mr.\r\nWrenn’s editorial pencil. She had no desire to know, but she supposed\r\nshe must engage this person in conversation.\r\n\r\n“From America, yes. Yes, from America.”\r\n\r\n“Is this your first visit to England?” asked Kay, stifling a yawn.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. I was at school in England.”\r\n\r\n“Really? Where?”\r\n\r\n“At Wrykyn.”\r\n\r\nKay’s attitude of stiff aloofness relaxed. She became interested.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious! Of course!” She looked upon him quite benevolently. “A\r\nfriend of yours was talking to me about you only yesterday--Willoughby\r\nBraddock.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the Bradder?” gulped Sam, astounded.\r\n\r\n“I’ve known him all my life.”\r\n\r\nA most extraordinary sensation flooded over Sam. It was hard to analyse,\r\nbut its effects were thoroughly definite. At the discovery that this\r\nwonderful girl knew the old Bradder and that they could pave the way to\r\na beautiful friendship by talking about the old Bradder, the office of\r\nPyke’s _Home Companion_ became all at once flooded with brilliant\r\nsunshine. Birds twittered from the ceiling, and blended with their notes\r\nwas the soft music of violins and harps.\r\n\r\n“You really know the Bradder?”\r\n\r\n“We were children together.”\r\n\r\n“What a splendid chap!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he’s a dear.”\r\n\r\n“What a corker!”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“What an egg!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Tell me, Mr. Shotter,” said Kay wearying of this eulogy, “do you\r\nremember a boy at your school named Bates?”\r\n\r\nSam’s face darkened. Time had softened the anguish of that moment\r\noutside the Angry Cheese, but the sting still remained.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do.”\r\n\r\n“Willoughby Braddock told me that you once beat Bates with a walking\r\nstick.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“A large walking stick?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did you beat him hard?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, as hard as ever I could lay it in.”\r\n\r\nA little sigh of gratification escaped Kay.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she said.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the foregoing conversation the two had been diminishing\r\ninch by inch the gap which had separated them at its outset, so that\r\nthey had come to be standing only a short distance apart; and now, as\r\nshe heard those beautiful words, Kay looked up into Sam’s face with a\r\ncordial, congratulatory friendliness which caused him to quiver like a\r\nsmitten blanc-mange. Then, while he was still reeling, she smiled. And\r\nit is at this point that the task of setting down the sequence of events\r\nbecomes difficult for the historian.\r\n\r\nFor, briefly, what happened next was that Sam, groping forward in a\r\nbemused fashion and gathering her clumsily into his arms, kissed Kay.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nIt might, of course, be possible to lay no stress upon this\r\noccurrence--to ignore it and pass. In kissing, as kissing, there is\r\nnothing fundamentally reprehensible. The early Christians used to do it\r\nall the time to everyone they met. But the historian is too conscious of\r\nthe raised eyebrows of his audience to attempt this attitude. Some\r\nexplanation, he realises, some argument to show why Sam is not to be\r\ncondemned out of hand, is imperative.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the embarrassing nature of the historian’s\r\nposition is readily intelligible. Only a short while back he was\r\ninviting the customers to shudder with loathing at the spectacle of\r\nClaude Bates kissing this girl, and now, all in a flash, he finds\r\nhimself faced with the task of endeavouring to palliate the behaviour of\r\nSam Shotter in doing the very same thing.\r\n\r\nWell, he must do the best he can. Let us marshal the facts.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there stood on Mr. Wrenn’s desk, as on every other\r\neditorial desk in Tilbury House, a large framed card bearing the words,\r\nDO IT NOW! Who shall say whether this may not subconsciously have\r\ninfluenced the young man?\r\n\r\nIn the second place, when you have been carrying about a girl’s\r\nphotograph in your breast pocket for four months and brooding over it\r\nseveral times a day with a beating heart, it is difficult for you to\r\nregard that girl, when you eventually meet her, as a perfect stranger.\r\n\r\nAnd in the third place--and here we approach the very root of the\r\nmatter--there was the smile.\r\n\r\nGirls as pretty as Kay Derrick, especially if their faces are by nature\r\na little grave, should be extremely careful how and when they smile.\r\nThere was that about Kay’s face when in repose which, even when she was\r\nmerely wondering what trimming to put on a hat, gave strangers the\r\nimpression that here was a pure white soul musing wistfully on life’s\r\nsadness. The consequence was that when she smiled it was as if the sun\r\nhad suddenly shone out through clouds. Her smile seemed to make the\r\nworld on the instant a sweeter and a better place. Policemen, when she\r\nflashed it on them after being told the way somewhere, became of a\r\nsudden gayer, happier policemen and sang as they directed the traffic.\r\nBeggars, receiving it as a supplement to a small donation, perked up\r\nlike magic and started to bite the ears of the passers-by with an\r\nabandon that made all the difference. And when they saw that smile, even\r\nbabies in their perambulators stopped looking like peevish poached eggs\r\nand became almost human.\r\n\r\nAnd it was this smile that she had bestowed upon Sam. And Sam, it will\r\nbe remembered, had been waiting months and months for it.\r\n\r\nWe have made out, we fancy, a pretty good case for Samuel Shotter; and\r\nit was a pity that some kindly person was not present in Mr. Wrenn’s\r\noffice at that moment to place these arguments before Kay. For not one\r\nof them occurred to her independently. She could see no excuse whatever\r\nfor Sam’s conduct. She had wrenched herself from his grasp and moved to\r\nthe other side of the desk, and across this she now regarded him with a\r\nblazing eye. Her fists were clenched and she was breathing quickly. She\r\nhad the air of a girl who would have given a year’s pocket money for a\r\ncopy of the Rev. Aubrey Jerningham’s _Is There a Hell?_\r\n\r\nGone was that delightful spirit of comradeship which, when he had been\r\ntelling of his boyish dealings with Claude, had made him seem almost a\r\nkindred soul. Gone was that soft sensation of gratitude which had come\r\nto her on his assurance that he had not risked spoiling that repulsive\r\nyouth by sparing the rod. All she felt now was that her first\r\nimpressions of this young man had been right, and that she had been\r\nmauled and insulted by a black-hearted bounder whose very clothes should\r\nhave warned her of his innate despicableness. It seems almost incredible\r\nthat anyone should think such a thing of anybody, but it is a fact that\r\nin that instant Kay Derrick looked upon Sam as something even lower in\r\nthe graduated scale of human subspecies than Claude Winnington-Bates.\r\n\r\nAs for Sam, he was still under the ether.\r\n\r\nNothing is more difficult for both parties concerned than to know what\r\nto say immediately after an occurrence like this. An agitated silence\r\nwas brooding over the room, when the necessity for speech was removed by\r\nthe re-entry of Mr. Wrenn.\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn was not an observant man. Nor was he sensitive to atmosphere.\r\nHe saw nothing unusual in his niece’s aspect, nothing out of the way in\r\nSam’s. The fact that the air inside the office of Pyke’s _Home\r\nCompanion_ was quivering with charged emotion escaped his notice\r\naltogether. He addressed Sam genially.\r\n\r\n“It is quite all right, Mr. Shotter. Lord Tilbury wishes you to start\r\nwork on the _Companion_ at once.”\r\n\r\nSam turned to him with the vague stare of the newly awakened\r\nsleepwalker.\r\n\r\n“It will be nice having you in the office,” added Mr. Wrenn amiably. “I\r\nhave been short-handed. By the way, Lord Tilbury asked me to send you\r\nalong to him at once. He is just going out to lunch.”\r\n\r\n“Lunch?” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“He said you were lunching with him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Sam dully.\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn watched him shamble out of the room with a benevolent eye.\r\n\r\n“We’ll go and have a bite to eat too, my dear,” he said, removing the\r\nalpaca coat which it was his custom to wear in the office. “Haven’t had\r\nlunch with you since I don’t know when.” He reached for the hook which\r\nheld his other coat. “I shall like having this young Shotter in the\r\noffice,” he said. “He seems a nice young fellow.”\r\n\r\n“He is the most utterly loathsome creature I have ever met,” said Kay.\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn, startled, dropped his hat.\r\n\r\n“Eh? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Just what I say. He’s horrible.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear girl, you only met him five minutes ago.”\r\n\r\n“I know.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn stooped for his hat and smoothed it with some agitation.\r\n\r\n“This is rather awkward,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What is?”\r\n\r\n“Your feeling like that about young Shotter.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why. I don’t suppose I shall ever meet him again.”\r\n\r\n“But you will. I don’t see how it can be prevented. Lord Tilbury tells\r\nme that this young man has taken a lease on Mon Repos.”\r\n\r\n“Mon Repos!” Kay clutched at the desk. “You don’t mean Mon Repos next\r\ndoor to us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and it is so difficult to avoid one’s next-door neighbours.”\r\n\r\nKay’s teeth met with a little click.\r\n\r\n“It can be done,” she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\nINTRODUCING A SYNDICATE\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the way from Tilbury House, next door to the massive annex\r\ncontaining the offices of _Tiny Tots_, _Sabbath Jottings_, _British\r\nGirlhood_, the _Boys’ Adventure Weekly_ and others of the more recently\r\nestablished of the Mammoth Publishing Company’s periodicals, there\r\nstands a ramshackle four-storied building of an almost majestic\r\ndinginess, which Lord Tilbury, but for certain regulations having to do\r\nwith ancient lights, would have swallowed up years ago, as he had\r\nswallowed the rest of the street.\r\n\r\nThe first three floors of this building are occupied by firms of the\r\npathetic type which cannot conceivably be supposed to do any business,\r\nand yet hang on with dull persistency for decade after decade. Their\r\nwindows are dirty and forlorn and most of the lettering outside has been\r\nworn away, so that on the second floor it would appear that trade is\r\nbeing carried by the Ja--& Sum--r--Rub--Co., while just above, Messrs.\r\nSmith, R-bi-s-n & G----, that mystic firm, are dealing in something\r\ncurtly described as c----. It is not until we reach the fourth and final\r\nfloor that we find the modern note struck.\r\n\r\nHere the writing is not only clear and golden but, when read,\r\nstimulating to the imagination. It runs:\r\n\r\n                  THE TILBURY DETECTIVE AGENCY, LTD.\r\n                       J. Sheringham Adair, Mgr.\r\n                       Large and Efficient Staff\r\n\r\nand conjures up visions of a suite of rooms filled with hawk-faced men\r\nexamining bloodstains through microscopes or poring tensely over the\r\npapers connected with the singular affair of the theft of the\r\nmaharajah’s ruby.\r\n\r\nOn the morning, however, on which Sam Shotter paid his visit to Tilbury\r\nHouse, only one man was sitting in the office of the detective agency.\r\nHe was a small and weedy individual, clad in a suit brighter even than\r\nthe one which Sam had purchased from the Brothers Cohen. And when it is\r\nstated in addition that he wore a waxed moustache and that his\r\nhandkerchief, which was of colored silk, filled the air with a noisome\r\nperfume, further evidence is scarcely required to convince the reader\r\nthat he is being introduced to a most undesirable character.\r\nNevertheless, the final damning fact may as well be revealed. It is\r\nthis--the man was not looking out of a window.\r\n\r\nTilbury Street is very narrow and the fourth-floor windows of this\r\nramshackle building are immediately opposite those of the fourth floor\r\nof Tilbury House. Alexander Twist therefore was in a position, if he\r\npleased, to gaze through into the private sanctum of the proprietor of\r\nthe Mammoth Publishing Company and obtain the spiritual uplift which\r\ncould hardly fail to result from the spectacle of that great man at\r\nwork. Alone of London’s millions of inhabitants, he had it in his power\r\nto watch Lord Tilbury pacing up and down, writing at his desk or\r\nspeaking into the dictating device who knows what terrific thoughts.\r\n\r\nYet he preferred to sit at a table playing solitaire--and, one is\r\nprepared to bet, cheating. One need not, one fancies, say more.\r\n\r\nSo absorbed was Mr. Twist in his foolish game that the fact that someone\r\nwas knocking on the door did not at first penetrate his senses. It was\r\nonly when the person outside, growing impatient, rapped the panel with\r\nsome hard object which might have been the handle of a lady’s parasol\r\nthat he raised his head with a start. He swept the cards into a drawer,\r\ngave his coat a settling tug and rose alertly. The knock sounded like\r\nbusiness, and Mr. Twist, who was not only J. Sheringham Adair, Mgr., but\r\nthe large and efficient staff as well, was not the man to be caught\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” he shouted.\r\n\r\nWith a quick flick of his hand he scattered a top dressing of\r\nimportant-looking papers about the table and was bending over these with\r\na thoughtful frown when the door opened.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of his visitor he relaxed the preoccupied austerity of his\r\ndemeanour. The new-comer was a girl in the middle twenties, of bold but\r\nat the moment rather sullen good looks. She had the bright hazel eyes\r\nwhich seldom go with a meek and contrite heart. Her colouring was vivid,\r\nand in the light from the window her hair gleamed with a sheen that was\r\nslightly metallic.\r\n\r\n“Why, hello, Dolly,” said Mr. Twist.\r\n\r\n“Hello,” said the girl moodily.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t seen you for a year, Dolly. Never knew you were this side at\r\nall. Take a seat.”\r\n\r\nThe visitor took a seat.\r\n\r\n“For the love of pop, Chimp,” she said, eying him with a languid\r\ncuriosity, “where did you get the fungus?”\r\n\r\nMr. Twist moved in candid circles, and the soubriquet Chimp--short for\r\nChimpanzee--by which he was known not only to his intimates but to\r\npolice officials in America who would have liked to become more intimate\r\nthan they were, had been bestowed upon him at an early stage of his\r\ncareer in recognition of a certain simian trend which critics affected\r\nto see in the arrangement of his features.\r\n\r\n“Looks good, don’t you think?” he said, stroking his moustache fondly.\r\nIt and money were the only things he loved.\r\n\r\n“Anything you say. And I suppose, when you know you may be in the coop\r\nany moment, you like to have all the hair you can while you can.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twist felt a little wounded. He did not like badinage about his\r\nmoustache. He did not like tactless allusions to the coop. And he was\r\npuzzled by the unwonted brusqueness of the girl’s manner. The Dora Gunn\r\nhe had known had been a cheery soul, quite unlike this tight-lipped,\r\nsombre-eyed person now before him.\r\n\r\nThe girl was looking about her. She seemed perplexed.\r\n\r\n“What’s all this?” she asked, pointing her parasol at the writing on the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nMr. Twist smiled indulgently and with a certain pride. He was, he\r\nflattered himself, a man of ideas, and this of presenting himself to the\r\nworld as a private investigator he considered one of his happiest.\r\n\r\n“Just camouflage,” he said. “Darned useful to have a label. Keeps people\r\nfrom asking questions.”\r\n\r\n“It won’t keep me from asking questions. That’s what I’ve come for. Say,\r\nChimp, can you tell the truth without straining a muscle?”\r\n\r\n“You know me, Dolly.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s why I asked. Well, I’ve come to get you to tell me\r\nsomething. Nobody listening?”\r\n\r\n“Not a soul.”\r\n\r\n“How about the office boy?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t got an office boy. Who do you think I am--Pierpont Morgan?”\r\n\r\nThus reassured, the girl produced a delicate handkerchief, formerly the\r\nproperty of Harrod’s Stores and parted from unwittingly by that\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n“Chimp,” she said, brushing away a tear, “I’m sim’ly miserable.”\r\n\r\nChimp Twist was not the man to stand idly by while beauty in distress\r\nwept before him. He slid up and was placing a tender arm about her\r\nshoulder, when she jerked herself away.\r\n\r\n“You can tie a can to that stuff,” she said with womanly dignity. “I’d\r\nlike you to know I’m married.”\r\n\r\n“Married?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Day before yesterday--to Soapy Molloy.”\r\n\r\n“Soapy!” Mr. Twist started. “What in the world did you want to marry\r\nthat slab of Gorgonzola for?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll ask you kindly, if you wouldn’t mind,” said the girl in a cold\r\nvoice, “not to go alluding to my husband as slabs of Gorgonzola.”\r\n\r\n“He is a slab of Gorgonzola.”\r\n\r\n“He is not. Well, anyway, I’m hoping he’s not. It’s what I come here to\r\nfind out.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twist’s mind had returned to the perplexing matter of the marriage.\r\n\r\n“I don’t get this,” he said. “I saw Soapy a couple of weeks back and he\r\ndidn’t say he’d even met you.”\r\n\r\n“He hadn’t then. We only run into each other ten days ago. I was walking\r\nup the Haymarket and I catch sight of a feller behind me out of the\r\ncorner of my eye, so I faint on him, see?”\r\n\r\n“You’re still in that line, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s what I do best, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nChimp nodded. Dora Molloy--Fainting Dolly to her friends--was\r\nunquestionably an artist in her particular branch of industry. It was\r\nher practice to swoon in the arms of rich-looking strangers in the\r\npublic streets and pick their pockets as they bent to render her\r\nassistance. It takes all sorts to do the world’s work.\r\n\r\n“Well, then I seen it was Soapy, and so we go to lunch and have a nice\r\nchat. I always was strong for that boy, and we were both feeling kind of\r\nlonesome over here in London, so we fix it up. And now I’m sim’ly\r\nmiserable.”\r\n\r\n“What,” inquired Mr. Twist, “is biting you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll tell you. This is what’s happened: Last night this bird\r\nSoapy goes out after supper and doesn’t blow in again till four in the\r\nmorning. Four in the morning, I’ll trouble you, and us only married two\r\ndays. Well, if he thinks a young bride’s going to stand for that sort of\r\nconduct right plumb spang in the middle of what you might call the\r\nhoneymoon, he’s got a second guess due him.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do?” asked Mr. Twist sympathetically, but with a touch of\r\nthat rather unctuous complacency which bachelors display at moments like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n“I did plenty. And he tried to alibi himself by pulling a story. That\r\nstory the grand jury is now going to investigate and investigate\r\ngood.... Chimp, did you ever hear of a man named Finglass?”\r\n\r\nThere was that in Mr. Twist’s manner that seemed to suggest that he was\r\na reluctant witness, but he answered after a brief hesitation.\r\n\r\n“Sure!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you did, eh? Well, who was he then?”\r\n\r\n“He was big,” said Chimp, and there was a note of reverence in his\r\nvoice. “One of the very biggest, old Finky was.”\r\n\r\n“How was he big? What did he ever do?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was before your time and it happened over here, so I guess you\r\nmay not have heard of it; but he took a couple of million dollars away\r\nfrom the New Asiatic Bank.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Molloy was undeniably impressed. The formidable severity of her\r\nmanner seemed to waver.\r\n\r\n“Were you and Soapy mixed up with him?”\r\n\r\n“Sure! We were the best pals he had.”\r\n\r\n“Is he alive?”\r\n\r\n“No; he died in Buenos Aires the other day.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Molloy bit her lower lip thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Say, it’s beginning to look to me like that story of Soapy’s was the\r\ngoods after all. Listen, Chimp, I’d best tell you the whole thing. When\r\nI give Soapy the razz for staying out all night like the way he done, he\r\npulled this long spiel about having had a letter from a guy he used to\r\nknow named Finglass, written on his deathbed, saying that this guy\r\nFinglass hadn’t been able to get away with the money he’d swiped from\r\nthis New Asiatic Bank on account the bulls being after him, and he’d had\r\nto leave the whole entire lot of it behind, hidden in some house down in\r\nthe suburbs somewheres. And he told Soapy where the house was, and Soapy\r\nclaims that what kep’ him out so late was he’d been searching the house,\r\ntrying to locate the stuff. And what I want to know is, was he telling\r\nthe truth or was he off somewheres at one of these here now gilded\r\nnight-clubs, cutting up with a bunch of janes and doing me wrong?”\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Twist seemed to resent the necessity of acting as a favourable\r\nwitness for a man he obviously disliked. He struggled with his feelings\r\nfor a space.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s true,” he said at length.\r\n\r\n“But listen here. This don’t seem to me to gee up. If this guy Finglass\r\nwanted Soapy to have the money, why did he wait all this time before\r\ntelling him about it?”\r\n\r\n“Thought he might find a chance of sneaking back and getting it himself,\r\nof course. But he got into trouble in Argentina almost as soon as he hit\r\nthe place, and they stowed him away in the cooler; and he only got out\r\nin time to write the letters and then make his finish.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know all that?”\r\n\r\n“Finky wrote to me too.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, did he? Well, then, here’s another thing that don’t seem to make\r\nsense: When he did finally get round to telling Soap about this money,\r\nwhy couldn’t he let him know where it was? I mean, why didn’t he say\r\nit’s under the mat or poked up the chimney or something, ’stead of\r\nleaving him hunt for it like he was playing button, button, where’s the\r\nbutton--or something?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Mr. Twist bitterly, “Soapy and me were both pals of his,\r\nand he wanted us to share. And to make sure we should get together he\r\ntold Soapy where the house was and me where the stuff was hidden in the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“So you’ve only to pool your info’ to bring home the bacon?” cried\r\nDolly, wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n“That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Then why in time haven’t you done it?”\r\n\r\nMr. Twist snorted. It is not easy to classify snorts, but this was one\r\nwhich would have been recognised immediately by any expert as the snort\r\ndespairing, caused by the contemplation of the depths to which human\r\nnature can sink.\r\n\r\n“Because,” he said, “Soapy, the pig-headed stiff, thinks he can\r\ndouble-cross me and get it alone.”\r\n\r\n“What?” Mrs. Molloy uttered a cry of wifely pride. “Well, isn’t that\r\nbright of my sweet old pieface! I’d never of thought the dear boy would\r\nhave had the sense to think up anything like that.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twist was unable to share her pretty enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“A lot it’s going to get him!” he said sourly.\r\n\r\n“Two million smackers it’s going to get him,” retorted Dolly.\r\n\r\n“Two million smackers nothing! The stuff’s hidden in a place where he’d\r\nnever think of looking in two million years.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t bluff me, Chimp Twist,” said Dolly, gazing at him with the\r\ncold disdain of a princess confronted with a boll weevil. “If he keeps\r\non looking, it stands to reason----”\r\n\r\nShe broke off. The door had opened and a man was entering. He was a\r\nfine, handsome, open-faced man of early middle age. At the sight of this\r\nperson Chimp Twist’s eyes narrowed militantly, but Dolly flung herself\r\ninto his arms with a remorseful cry.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Soapy, darling! How I misjudged you!”\r\n\r\nThe new-comer had had the air of a man weighed down with the maximum\r\namount of sorrow which a human being can bear. This demonstration,\r\nhowever, seemed to remove something of the burden.\r\n\r\n“’S all right, sweetness,” he said, clasping her to his swelling bosom.\r\n\r\n“Was I mean to my angel-face?”\r\n\r\n“There, there, honey lamb!”\r\n\r\nChimp Twist looked sourly upon this nauseating scene of marital\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\n“Ah, cut it out!” he growled.\r\n\r\n“Chimp’s told me everything, baby doll,” proceeded Mrs. Molloy. “I know\r\nall about that money, and you just keep right along, precious, hunting\r\nfor it by yourself. I don’t mind how often you stay out nights or how\r\nlate you stay out.”\r\n\r\nIt was a generous dispensation, for which many husbands would have been\r\ngrateful, but Soapy Molloy merely smiled a twisted, tortured smile of\r\nineffable sadness. He looked like an unsuccessful candidate hearing the\r\nresult of a presidential election.\r\n\r\n“It’s all off, honey bunch,” he said, shaking his head. “It’s cold,\r\npetty. We’ll have to let Chimp in on it after all, sweetie-pie. I came\r\nhere to put my cards on the table and have a show-down.”\r\n\r\nA quivering silence fell upon the room. Mrs. Molloy was staring at her\r\nhusband, aghast. As for Chimp, he was completely bewildered. The theory\r\nthat his old comrade had had a change of heart--that his conscience,\r\nputting in some rapid work after getting off to a bad start, had caused\r\nhim to regret his intention of double-crossing a friend, was too bizarre\r\nto be tenable. Soapy Molloy was not the sort of man to have changes of\r\nheart. Chimp, in his studies of the motion-picture drama, had once seen\r\na film where a tough egg had been converted by hearing a church organ,\r\nbut he knew Mr. Molloy well enough to be aware that all the organs in\r\nall the churches in London might play in his ear simultaneously without\r\ncausing him to do anything more than grumble at the noise.\r\n\r\n“The house has been taken,” said Soapy despondently.\r\n\r\n“Taken? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Rented.”\r\n\r\n“Rented? When?”\r\n\r\n“I heard this morning. I was in a saloon down Fleet Street way, and two\r\nfellows come in and one of them was telling the other how he’d just\r\nrented this joint.”\r\n\r\nChimp Twist uttered a discordant laugh.\r\n\r\n“So that’s what’s come of your darned smooth double-crossing act!” he\r\nsaid nastily. “Yes, I guess you better had let Chimp in on it. You want\r\na man with brains now, not a guy that never thought up anything smarter\r\nthan gypping suckers with a phony oil stock.”\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy bowed his head meekly before the blast. His wife was made of\r\nsterner stuff.\r\n\r\n“You talk a lot, don’t you?” she said coldly.\r\n\r\n“And I can do a lot,” retorted Mr. Twist, fingering his waxed moustache.\r\n“So you’d best come clean, Soapy, and have a show-down, like you say.\r\nWhere is this joint?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you dare tell him before he tells you where the stuff is!” cried\r\nMrs. Molloy.\r\n\r\n“Just as you say,” said Chimp carelessly. He scribbled a few words on a\r\npiece of paper and covered them with his hand. “There! Now you write\r\ndown your end of it and Dolly can read them both out.”\r\n\r\n“Have you really thought up a scheme?” asked Mr. Molloy humbly.\r\n\r\n“I’ve thought up a dozen.”\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy wrote in his turn and Dolly picked up the two papers.\r\n\r\n“In the cistern!” she read.\r\n\r\n“And the rest of it?” inquired Mr. Twist pressingly.\r\n\r\n“Mon Repos, Burberry Road,” said Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Chimp. “And if I’d known that a week ago, we’d have been\r\nworth a million dollars apiece by now.”\r\n\r\n“Say, listen,” said Dolly, who was pensive and had begun to eye Mr.\r\nTwist in rather an unpleasant manner. “This stuff old Finglass swiped\r\nfrom the bank, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“American bearer securities, sweetie,” said her husband, rolling the\r\nwords round his tongue as if they were vintage port. “As good as dollar\r\nbills. What’s the dope you’ve thought up, Chimpie?” he asked,\r\ndeferentially removing a piece of fluff from his ally’s coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Just a minute!” said Dolly sharply. “If that’s so, how can this stuff\r\nbe in any cistern? It would have melted, being all that time in the\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\n“It’s in a waterproof case, of course,” said Chimp.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is, is it?”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, petty?” inquired Mr. Molloy. “You’re acting\r\nstrange.”\r\n\r\n“Am I? Well, if you want to know, I’m wondering if this guy is putting\r\none over on us. How are we to know he’s telling us the right place?”\r\n\r\n“Dolly!” said Mr. Twist, deeply pained.\r\n\r\n“Dolly!” said Mr. Molloy, not so much pained as apprehensive. He had a\r\nvery modest opinion of his own chances of thinking of any way for coping\r\nwith the situation which had arisen, and everything, it seemed to him,\r\ndepended upon being polite to Chimp Twist, who was admittedly a man of\r\ninfinite resource and sagacity.\r\n\r\n“If you think that of me----” began Mr. Twist.\r\n\r\n“We don’t, Chimpie, we don’t,” interrupted Mr. Molloy hastily. “The\r\nmadam is a little upset. Don’t listen to her. What is this scheme of\r\nyours, Chimpie?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mrs. Molloy’s estimate of her husband’s talents as a strategist\r\nresembled his own. At any rate, she choked down certain words that had\r\npresented themselves to her militant mind and stood eying Chimp\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Chimp. “But first let’s get the business end\r\nstraight. How do we divvy?”\r\n\r\n“Why, fifty-fifty, Chimp,” stammered Mr. Molloy, stunned at the\r\nsuggestion implied in his words that any other arrangement could be\r\ncontemplated. “Me and the madam counting as one, of course.”\r\n\r\nChimp laughed sardonically.\r\n\r\n“Fifty-fifty nothing! I’m the brains of this concern, and the brains of\r\na concern always gets paid highest. Look at Henry Ford! Look at the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury!”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say,” demanded Dolly, “that if Soapy was sitting in with\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury on a plan for skinning a sucker the\r\narchbish wouldn’t split Even Stephen?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t like that at all,” retorted Mr. Twist with spirit. “It’s more\r\nas if Soapy went to the Archbishop of Canterbury and asked him to slip\r\nhim a scheme for skinning the mug.”\r\n\r\n“Well, in that case,” said Mr. Molloy, “I venture to assert that the\r\narchbishop would simply say to me, ‘Molloy,’ he’d say----”\r\n\r\nDolly wearied of a discussion which seemed to her too academic for the\r\nwaste of valuable moments.\r\n\r\n“Sixty-forty,” she said brusquely.\r\n\r\n“Seventy-thirty,” emended Chimp.\r\n\r\n“Sixty-five-thirty-five,” said Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\n“Right!” said Chimp. “And now I’ll tell you what to do.” I’ll give you\r\nfive minutes first to see if you can think of it for yourself, and if\r\nyou can’t, I’ll ask you not to start beefing because it’s so simple and\r\nnot worth the money.”\r\n\r\nFive minutes’ concentrated meditation produced no brain wave in Mr.\r\nMolloy, who, outside his chosen profession of selling valueless oil\r\nstock to a trusting public, was not a very gifted man.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Chimp, “here you are: You go to that fellow who’s\r\ntaken the joint and ask him to let you buy it off him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, of all the fool propositions!” cried Dolly shrilly, and even Mr.\r\nMolloy came near to sneering.\r\n\r\n“Not so good, you don’t think?” continued Chimp, uncrushed. “Well, then,\r\nlisten here to the rest of it. Dolly calls on this fellow first. She\r\nacts surprised because her father hasn’t arrived yet.”\r\n\r\n“Her what?”\r\n\r\n“Her father. Then she starts in vamping this guy all she can. If she\r\nhasn’t lost her pep since she last tried that sort of thing, the guy\r\nought to be in pretty good shape for Act Two by the time the curtain\r\nrings up. That’s when you blow in, Soapy.”\r\n\r\n“Am I her father?” asked Mr. Molloy, a little blankly.\r\n\r\n“Sure, you’re her father. Why not?”\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy, who was a little sensitive about the difference in age\r\nbetween his bride and himself, considered that Chimp was not displaying\r\nhis usual tact, but muttered something about greying himself up some at\r\nthe temples.\r\n\r\n“Then what?” asked Dolly.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Chimp, “Soapy does a spiel.”\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy brightened. He knew himself to be at his best when it came to\r\na spiel.\r\n\r\n“Soapy says he was born in this joint--ages and ages ago.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean--ages and ages ago?” said Mr. Molloy, starting.\r\n\r\n“Ages and ages ago,” repeated Chimp firmly, “before he had to emigrate\r\nto America and leave the dear old place to be sold. He has loving\r\nchildhood recollections of the lawn where he played as a kiddy and\r\nworships every brick in the place. All his favourite relations pegged\r\nout in the rooms upstairs, and all like that. Well, I’m here to say,”\r\nconcluded Chimp emphatically, “that if that guy has any sentiment in him\r\nand if Dolly has done the preliminary work properly, he’ll drop.”\r\n\r\nThere was a tense silence.\r\n\r\n“It’ll work,” said Soapy.\r\n\r\n“It might work,” said Dolly, more doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“It will work,” said Soapy. “I shall be good. I will have that lobster\r\nweeping into his handkerchief inside three minutes.”\r\n\r\n“A lot depends on Dolly,” Chimp reminded him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you worry about that,” said the lady stoutly. “I’ll be good too.\r\nBut listen here; I’ve got to dress this act. This is where I have to\r\nhave that hat with the bird-of-paradise feather that I see in Regent\r\nStreet this morning.”\r\n\r\n“How much?” inquired the rest of the syndicate in a single breath.\r\n\r\n“Eighteen guineas.”\r\n\r\n“Eighteen guineas!” said Chimp.\r\n\r\n“Eighteen guineas!” said Soapy.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other wanly, while Dolly, unheeded, spoke of ships\r\nand ha’porths of tar.\r\n\r\n“And a new dress,” she continued, warming to her work. “And new shoes\r\nand a new parasol and new gloves and new----”\r\n\r\n“Have a heart, petty,” pleaded Mr. Molloy. “Exercise a little\r\ndiscretion, sweetness.”\r\n\r\nDolly was firm.\r\n\r\n“A girl,” she said, “can’t do herself justice in a tacky lid. You know\r\nthat. And you know as well as I do that the first thing a gentleman does\r\nis to look at a dame’s hoofs. And as for gloves, I simply beg you to\r\ncast an eye on these old things I’ve got on now and ask yourselves----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right, all right,” said Chimp.\r\n\r\n“All right,” echoed Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\nTheir faces were set grimly. These men were brave, but they were\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\nTHE CHIRRUP\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn looked up from his plate with a sudden start, a wild and\r\nfebrile glare of horror in his eyes. Old theatregoers, had any such been\r\npresent, would have been irresistibly reminded by his demeanour of the\r\nlate Sir Henry Irving in _The Bells_.\r\n\r\nIt was breakfast time at San Rafael; and, as always at this meal, the\r\nair was charged with an electric unrest. It is ever thus at breakfast in\r\nthe suburbs. The specter of a fleeting train broods over the feast,\r\nturning normally placid men into temporary neuropaths. Meeting Mr. Wrenn\r\nin Fleet Street after lunch, you would have set him down as a very\r\npleasant, quiet, elderly gentleman, rather on the mild side. At\r\nbreakfast, Bengal tigers could have picked up hints from him.\r\n\r\n“Zatawittle?” he gasped, speaking in the early morning patois of\r\nSuburbia, which is the English language filtered through toast and\r\nmarmalade.\r\n\r\n“Of course, it wasn’t a whistle, darling,” said Kay soothingly. “I keep\r\ntelling you you’ve lots of time.”\r\n\r\nPartially reassured, Mr. Wrenn went on with his meal. He finished his\r\ntoast and reached for his cup.\r\n\r\n“Wassatie?”\r\n\r\n“Only a quarter-past.”\r\n\r\n“Sure your washrah?”\r\n\r\n“I put it right yesterday.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment there came faintly from afar a sweet, musical chiming.\r\n\r\n“There’s the college clock striking the quarter,” said Kay.\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn’s fever subsided. If it was only a quarter-past he was on\r\nvelvet. He could linger and chat for a while. He could absolutely dally.\r\nHe pushed back his chair and lighted a cigarette with the air of a\r\nleisured man.\r\n\r\n“Kay, my dear,” he said, “I’ve been thinking--about this young fellow\r\nShotter.”\r\n\r\nKay jumped. By an odd coincidence, she had herself been thinking of Sam\r\nat that moment. It annoyed her to think of Sam, but she constantly found\r\nherself doing it.\r\n\r\n“I really think we ought to invite him to dinner one night.”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“But he seems so anxious to be friendly. Only yesterday he asked me if\r\nhe could drop round some time and borrow the garden roller. He said he\r\nunderstood that that was always the first move in the suburbs toward\r\nestablishing good neighbourly relations.”\r\n\r\n“If you ask him to dinner I shall go out.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand why you dislike him so much.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I just do.”\r\n\r\n“He seems to admire you tremendously.”\r\n\r\n“Does he?”\r\n\r\n“He keeps talking about you--asking what you were like as a child and\r\nwhether you ever did you hair differently and things of that kind.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“I rather wish you didn’t object to him so much. I should like to see\r\nsomething of him out of office hours. I find him a very pleasant fellow\r\nmyself, and extremely useful in the office. He has taken that Aunt\r\nYsobel page off my hands. You remember how I used to hate having to\r\nwrite that?”\r\n\r\n“Is that all he does?”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn chuckled.\r\n\r\n“By no means,” he said amusedly.\r\n\r\n“What are you laughing at?”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking,” explained Mr. Wrenn, “of something that happened\r\nyesterday. Cordelia Blair called to see me with one of her usual\r\ngrievances----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” said Kay sympathetically. Her uncle, she knew, was much\r\npersecuted by female contributors who called with grievances at the\r\noffices of Pyke’s _Home Companion_; and of all these gifted creatures,\r\nMiss Cordelia Blair was the one he feared most. “What was the trouble\r\nthis time?”\r\n\r\n“Apparently the artist who is illustrating _Hearts Aflame_ had drawn\r\nLeslie Mordyke in a lounge suit instead of dress clothes.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you bite these women’s heads off when they come bothering\r\nyou? You shouldn’t be so nice to them.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t, my dear,” said Mr. Wrenn plaintively. “I don’t know why it is,\r\nbut the mere sight of a woman novelist who is all upset seems to take\r\nall the heart out of me. I sometimes wish I could edit some paper like\r\n_Tiny Tots_ or _Our Feathered Chums_. I don’t suppose indignant children\r\ncome charging in on Mason or outraged canaries on Mortimer.... But I was\r\ntelling you--when I heard her voice in the outer office, I acquainted\r\nthis young fellow Shotter briefly with the facts, and he most nobly\r\nvolunteered to go out and soothe her.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t imagine him soothing anyone.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he certainly had the most remarkable effect on Miss Blair. He\r\ncame back ten minutes later to say that all was well and that she had\r\ngone away quite happy.”\r\n\r\n“Did he tell you how he had managed it?”\r\n\r\n“No.” Another chuckle escaped Mr. Wrenn. “Kay, it isn’t possible--you\r\ndon’t imagine--you don’t suppose he could conceivably, on such a very\r\nslight acquaintance, have kissed her, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I should think it very probable.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m bound to own----”\r\n\r\n“Don’t laugh in that horrible, ghoulish way, uncle!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help it. I could see nothing, you understand, as I was in the\r\ninner office; but there were most certainly sounds that suggested----”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn broke off. Again that musical chiming had come faintly to his\r\nears. But this time its effect was the reverse of soothing. He became a\r\nthing of furious activity. He ran to and fro, seizing his hat and\r\ndropping it, picking it up and dropping his brief case, retrieving the\r\nbrief case and dropping his stick. By the time he had finally shot out\r\nof the front door with his hat on his head, his brief case in his hand\r\nand his stick dangling from his arm, it was as if a tornado had passed\r\nthrough the interior of San Rafael, and Kay, having seen him off, went\r\nout into the garden to try to recover.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant, sunny morning, and she made for her favourite spot,\r\nthe shade of the large tree that hung over the edge of the lawn, a noble\r\ntree, as spreading as that which once sheltered the Village Blacksmith.\r\nTechnically, this belonged to Mon Repos, its roots being in the latter’s\r\ndomain; but its branches had grown out over the fence, and San Rafael,\r\nwith that injustice which is so marked a feature of human affairs, got\r\nall the benefit of its shade.\r\n\r\nSeated under this, with a gentle breeze ruffling her hair, Kay gave\r\nherself up to meditation.\r\n\r\nShe felt worried and upset and in the grip of one of her rare moods of\r\ndespondency. She had schooled herself to pine as little as possible for\r\nthe vanished luxury of Midways, but when she did so pine it was always\r\nat this time of the day. For although she had adjusted herself with\r\nalmost complete success to the conditions of life at San Rafael, she had\r\nnot yet learned to bear up under the suburban breakfast.\r\n\r\nAt Midways the meal had been so leisurely, so orderly, so spacious, so\r\nredolent of all that is most delightful in the country life of the\r\nwealthy; a meal of soft murmurs and rustling papers, of sunshine falling\r\non silver in the summer, of crackling fires in winter; a take-your-time\r\nmeal; a thing of dignity and comfort. Breakfast at San Rafael was a mere\r\nbrutish bolting of food, and it jarred upon her afresh each morning.\r\n\r\nThe breeze continued to play in her hair. Birds hopped upon the grass.\r\nSomeone down the road was using a lawn mower. Gradually the feeling of\r\nhaving been jolted and shaken by some rude force began to pass from Kay,\r\nand she was just reaching the stage where, re-establishing connection\r\nwith her sense of humour, she would be able to look upon the amusing\r\nside of the recent scramble, when from somewhere between earth and\r\nheaven there spoke a voice.\r\n\r\n“Oo-oo!” said the voice.\r\n\r\nKay was puzzled. Though no ornithologist, she had become reasonably\r\nfamiliar with the distinctive notes of such of our feathered chums as\r\nhaunted the garden of San Rafael, and this did not appear to be one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“I see you,” proceeded the voice lovingly. “How’s your pore head,\r\ndearie?”\r\n\r\nThe solution of the mystery presented itself at last. Kay raised her\r\neyes and beheld, straddled along a branch almost immediately above her,\r\na lean, stringy man of ruffianly aspect, his naturally unlovely face\r\nrendered additionally hideous by an arch and sentimental smile. For a\r\nlong instant this person goggled at her, and she stared back at him.\r\nThen, with a gasp that sounded confusedly apologetic, he scrambled back\r\nalong the branch like an anthropoid ape, and dropping to earth beyond\r\nthe fence, galloped blushingly up the garden.\r\n\r\nKay sprang to her feet. She had been feeling soothed, but now a bubbling\r\nfury had her in its grip. It was bad enough that outcasts like Sam\r\nShotter should come and camp themselves next door to her. It was bad\r\nenough that they should annoy her uncle, a busy man, with foolish\r\nquestions about what she had been like as a child and whether she had\r\never done her hair differently. But when their vile retainers went to\r\nthe length of climbing trees and chirruping at her out of them, the\r\nsituation, it seemed to her, passed beyond the limit up to which a\r\nspirited girl may reasonably be expected to endure.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the house, fermenting, and as she reached the hall the\r\nfront doorbell rang.\r\n\r\nTechnically, when the front doorbell of San Rafael rang, it was Claire\r\nLippett’s duty to answer it; but Claire was upstairs making beds. Kay\r\nstalked across the hall, and having turned the handle, found confronting\r\nher a young woman of spectacular appearance, clad in gorgeous raiment\r\nand surmounted by a bird-of-paradise-feathered hat so much too good for\r\nher that Kay’s immediate reaction of beholding it was one of simple and\r\nignoble jealousy. It was the sort of hat she would have liked to be able\r\nto afford herself, and its presence on the dyed hair of another cemented\r\nthe prejudice which that other’s face and eyes had aroused within her.\r\n\r\n“Does a guy named Shotter live here?” asked the visitor. Then, with the\r\nair of one remembering a part and with almost excessive refinement,\r\n“Could I see Mr. Shotter, if you please?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Shotter lives next door,” said Kay frostily.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank yaw. Thank yaw so much.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Kay.\r\n\r\nShe shut the door and went into the drawing-room. The feeling of being\r\nin a world bounded north, east, south and west by Sam Shotter had\r\nthoroughly poisoned her day.\r\n\r\nShe took pen, ink and paper and wrote viciously for a few moments.\r\n\r\n“Claire,” she called.\r\n\r\n“’Ullo!” replied a distant voice.\r\n\r\n“I’m leaving a note on the hall table. Will you take it next door some\r\ntime?”\r\n\r\n“Right-ho!” bellowed the obliging Miss Lippett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\nVISITORS AT MON REPOS\r\n\r\n\r\nSam was preparing to leave for the office when his visitor arrived. He\r\nhad, indeed, actually opened the front door.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Shottah?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sam. He was surprised to see Mrs. Molloy. He had not\r\nexpected visitors at so early a period of his tenancy. This, he\r\nsupposed, must be the suburban equivalent of the county calling on the\r\nnew-comer. Impressed by the hat, he assumed Dolly to be one of the old\r\naristocracy of Valley Fields. A certain challenging jauntiness in her\r\nbearing forbade the suspicion that she was collecting funds for charity.\r\n“Won’t you come in?”\r\n\r\n“Thank yaw. Thank yaw so much. The house agent told me your name.”\r\n\r\n“Cornelius?”\r\n\r\n“Gink with a full set of white whiskers. Say, somebody ought to put that\r\nbaby wise about the wonderful invention of the safety razor.”\r\n\r\nSam agreed that this might be in the public interest, but he began to\r\nrevise his views about the old aristocracy.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you’ll find the place in rather a mess,” he said\r\napologetically, leading the way to the drawing-room. “I’ve only just\r\nmoved in.”\r\n\r\nThe visitor replied that, on the contrary, she thought it cute.\r\n\r\n“I seem to know this joint by heart,” she said. “I’ve heard so much\r\nabout it from old pop.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I am acquainted with Mr. Popp.”\r\n\r\n“My father, I mean. He used to live here when he was a tiny kiddy.”\r\n\r\n“Really? I should have taken you for an American.”\r\n\r\n“I am American, and don’t let anyone tell you different.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t.”\r\n\r\n“One hundred per cent, that’s me,” Sam nodded.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, say, can you see by the dawn’s early light?’” he said reverently.\r\n\r\n“‘What so proudly’--I never can remember any more.”\r\n\r\n“No one,” Sam reminded her, “knows the words but the Argentines....”\r\n\r\n“...And the Portuguese and the Greeks.” The lady beamed. “Say, don’t\r\ntell me you’re American too!”\r\n\r\n“My mother was.”\r\n\r\n“Why, this is fine! Pop’ll be tickled to death.”\r\n\r\n“Is your father coming here too?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I should say so! You don’t think I pay calls on strange gentlemen\r\nall by myself, do you?” said the lady archly. “But listen! If you’re\r\nAmerican, we’re sitting pretty, because it’s only us Americans that’s\r\ngot real sentiment in them. Ain’t it the truth?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite understand. Why do you want me to have sentiment?”\r\n\r\n“Pop’ll explain all that when he arrives. I’m surprised he hasn’t blown\r\nin yet. I didn’t think I’d get here first.” She looked about her. “It\r\nseems funny to think of pop as a little kiddy in this very room.”\r\n\r\n“Your father was English then?”\r\n\r\n“Born in England--born here--born in this very house. Just to think of\r\npop playing all them childish games in this very room!”\r\n\r\nSam began to wish that she would stop. Her conversation was beginning to\r\ngive the place a queer feeling. The room had begun to seem haunted by a\r\npeculiar being of middle-aged face and juvenile costume. So much so that\r\nwhen she suddenly exclaimed, “There’s pop!” he had a momentary\r\nimpression that a whiskered elder in Lord Fauntleroy clothes was about\r\nto dance out from behind the sofa.\r\n\r\nThen he saw that his visitor was looking out of the window and,\r\nfollowing her gaze, noted upon the front steps a gentleman of majestic\r\nport.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go and let him in,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Do you live here all alone?” asked the lady, and Sam got the idea that\r\nshe spoke eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, I’ve a man. But he’s busy somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” she said disappointedly.\r\n\r\nThe glimpse which Sam had caught of the new arrival through the window\r\nhad been a sketchy one. It was only as he opened the door that he got a\r\nfull view of him. And having done so, he was a little startled. It is\r\nalways disconcerting to see a familiar face where one had expected a\r\nstrange one. This was the man he had seen in the bar that day when he\r\nhad met Hash in Fleet Street.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Sam that the man had aged a good deal since he had seen him\r\nlast. The fact was that Mr. Molloy, in greying himself up at the\r\ntemples, had rather overdone the treatment. Still, though stricken in\r\nyears, he looked a genial, kindly, honest soul.\r\n\r\n“My name is Gunn, Mr. Shotter--Thomas G. Gunn.”\r\n\r\nIt had been Mr. Molloy’s intention--for he was an artist and liked to do\r\na thing, as he said, properly--to adopt for this interview the pseudonym\r\nof J. Felkin Haggenbakker, that seeming to his critical view the sort of\r\nname a sentimental millionaire who had made a fortune in Pittsburgh and\r\nwas now revisiting the home of his boyhood ought to have. The proposal\r\nhad been vetoed by Dolly, who protested that she did not intend to spend\r\nhours of her time in unnecessary study.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you come in?” said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe stood aside to let his visitor pass, wondering again where it was\r\nthat he had originally seen the man. He hated to forget a face and\r\npersonality which should have been unforgettable. He ushered Mr. Gunn\r\ninto the drawing-room, still pondering.\r\n\r\n“So there you are, pop,” said the lady. “Say, pop, isn’t it dandy? Mr.\r\nShotter’s an American.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gunn’s frank eyes lit up with gratification.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Then you are a man of sentiment, Mr. Shotter. You will understand.\r\nYou will not think it odd that a man should cherish all through his life\r\na wistful yearning for the place where he was born.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Sam politely, and might have reminded his visitor\r\nthat the feeling, a highly creditable one, was shared by practically all\r\nAmerica’s most eminent song writers.\r\n\r\n“Well, that is how I feel, Mr. Shotter,” said the other bluffly, “and I\r\nam not ashamed to confess it. This house is very dear to me. I was born\r\nin it.”\r\n\r\n“So Miss Gunn was telling me.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, she has told you? Yes, Mr. Shotter, I am a man who has seen men and\r\ncities. I have lived in the hovels of the poor, I have risen till, if I\r\nmay say so, I am welcomed in the palaces of the rich. But never, rich or\r\npoor, have I forgotten this old place and the childhood associations\r\nwhich hallow it.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. His voice had trembled and sunk to a whisper in those last\r\nwords, and now he turned abruptly and looked out of a window. His\r\nshoulders heaved significantly for an instant and something like a\r\nstifled sob broke the stillness of the room. But when a moment later he\r\nswung round he was himself again, the tough, sturdy old J. Felkin\r\nHaggenbakker--or, rather, Thomas G. Gunn--who was so highly respected,\r\nand perhaps a little feared, at the Rotary Club in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\n“Well, I must not bore you, Mr. Shotter. You are, no doubt, a busy man.\r\nLet me be brief. Mr. Shotter, I want this house.”\r\n\r\n“You want what?” said Sam, bewildered. He had had no notion that he was\r\ngoing to be swept into the maelstrom of a business transaction.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I want this house. And let me tell you that money is no\r\nobject. I’ve lots of money.” He dismissed money with a gesture. “I have\r\nmy whims and I can pay for them. How much for the house, Mr. Shotter?”\r\n\r\nSam felt that it behooved him to keep his head. He had not the remotest\r\nintention of selling for all the gold in Pittsburgh a house which, in\r\nthe first place, did not belong to him and, secondly, was next door to\r\nKay Derrick.\r\n\r\n“I’m very sorry----” he began.\r\n\r\nMr. Gunn checked him with an apologetic lift of the hand.\r\n\r\n“I was too abrupt,” he said. “I rushed the thing. A bad habit of mine.\r\nWhen I was prospecting in Nevada, the boys used to call me Hair-Trigger\r\nGunn. I ought to have stated my position more clearly.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I understand your position.”\r\n\r\n“You realise then that this isn’t a house to me; it is a shrine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; but----”\r\n\r\n“It contains,” said Mr. Gunn with perfect truth, “something very\r\nprecious to me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but----”\r\n\r\n“It is my boyhood that is enshrined here--my innocent, happy, halcyon\r\nboyhood. I have played games at my mother’s knee in this very room. I\r\nhave read tales from the Scriptures with her here. It was here that my\r\nmother, seated at the piano, used to sing--sing----”\r\n\r\nHis voice died away again. He blew his nose and turned once more to the\r\nwindow. But though he was under the impression that he had achieved a\r\nhighly artistic aposiopesis, he could hardly have selected a more\r\nunfortunate word to stammer brokenly. Something resembling an electric\r\nthrill ran through Sam. Memory, dormant, had responded to the code word.\r\n\r\nSing Sing! He knew now where he had seen this man before.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom of the Welfare League of America’s most famous\r\npenitentiary to alleviate the monotony of the convict’s lot by giving\r\nperiodical performances of plays, produced and acted by the personnel of\r\nthe prison. When the enterprising burglar isn’t burgling, in fact, he is\r\nprobably memorising the words of some popular lyric for rendition on the\r\nnext big night.\r\n\r\nTo one of these performances, some eighteen months back, Sam had been\r\ntaken by a newspaper friend. The hit of the evening had been this very\r\nThomas G. Gunn, then a mere number, in the rôle of a senator.\r\n\r\nMr. Gunn had resumed his address. He was speaking once more of his\r\nmother, and speaking well. But he was not holding his audience. Sam cut\r\nin on his eloquence.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” he said, “but I’m afraid this house is not for sale.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Shotter----”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Sam. “I have a very special reason for wishing to stay here,\r\nand I intend to remain. And now I’m afraid I must ask you----”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I look in this evening and take the matter up again?” pleaded\r\nMr. Gunn, finding with some surprise that he had been edged out onto the\r\nsteps and making a last stand there.\r\n\r\n“It’s no use. Besides, I shan’t be in this evening. I’m dining out.”\r\n\r\n“Will anybody be in?” asked Miss Gunn suddenly, breaking a long silence.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” said Sam, somewhat surprised, “the man who works here. Why?”\r\n\r\n“I was only thinking that if we called he might show us over the place.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see. Well, good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“But, say now, listen----”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe closed the door and made his way to the kitchen. Hash, his chair\r\ntilted back against the wall, was smoking a thoughtful pipe.\r\n\r\n“Who was it, Sam?”\r\n\r\n“Somebody wanting to buy the house. Hash, there’s something fishy going\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“Ur?”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember me pointing out a man to you in that bar in Fleet\r\nStreet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was the same fellow. And do you remember me saying that I was\r\nsure I had seen him before somewhere?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve remembered where it was. It was in Sing Sing, and he was\r\nserving a sentence there.”\r\n\r\nMr. Todhunter’s feet came to the floor with a crash.\r\n\r\n“There’s something darned peculiar about this house, Hash. I slept in it\r\nthe night I landed, and there was a fellow creeping around with an\r\nelectric torch. And now this man, whom I know to be a crook, puts up a\r\nfake story to make me let him have it. What do you think, Hash?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what I think,” said Mr. Todhunter, alarmed. “I think I’m\r\ngoing straight out to buy a good watchdog.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a good idea.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like these bad characters hanging about. I had a cousin in the\r\npawnbroking line what was hit on the ’ead by a burglar with a antique\r\nvase. That’s what happened to him, all through hearing a noise in the\r\nnight and coming down to see what it was.”\r\n\r\n“But what’s at the back of all this? What do you make of it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, there you have me,” said Hash frankly. “But that don’t alter the\r\nfact that I’m going to get a dog.”\r\n\r\n“I should. Get something pretty fierce.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll get a dog,” said Hash solemnly, “that’ll feed on nails and bite\r\nhis own mother.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n\r\nASTONISHING STATEMENT OF HASH TODHUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe dinner to which Sam had been bidden that night was at the house of\r\nhis old friend, Mr. Willoughby Braddock, in John Street, Mayfair, and at\r\nten minutes to eight Mr. Braddock was fidgeting about the morning-room,\r\ninterviewing his housekeeper, Mrs. Martha Lippett. His guests would be\r\narriving at any moment, and for the last quarter of an hour, a-twitter\r\nwith the nervousness of an anxious host, he had been popping about the\r\nplace on a series of tours of inspection, as jumpy, to quote the words\r\nof Sleddon, his butler--whom, by leaping suddenly out from the dimly lit\r\ndining-room, he had caused to bite his tongue and nearly drop a tray of\r\nglasses--as an old hen. The general consensus of opinion below stairs\r\nwas that Willoughby Braddock, in his capacity of master of the revels,\r\nwas making a thorough pest of himself.\r\n\r\n“You are absolutely certain that everything is all right, Mrs. Lippett?”\r\n\r\n“Everything is quite all right, Master Willie,” replied the housekeeper\r\nequably.\r\n\r\nThis redoubtable woman differed from her daughter Claire in being tall\r\nand thin and beaked like an eagle. One of the well-known Bromage family\r\nof Marshott-in-the-Dale, she had watched with complacent pride the\r\nBromage nose developing in her sons and daughters, and it had always\r\nbeen a secret grief to her that Claire, her favourite, who inherited so\r\nmuch of her forceful and determined character, should have been the only\r\none of her children to take nasally after the inferior, or Lippett, side\r\nof the house. Mr. Lippett had been an undistinguished man, hardly fit to\r\nmate with a Bromage and certainly not worthy to be resembled in\r\nappearance by the best of his daughters.\r\n\r\n“You’re sure there will be enough to eat?”\r\n\r\n“There will be ample to eat.”\r\n\r\n“How about drinks?” said Mr. Braddock, and was reminded by the word of a\r\ngrievance which had been rankling within his bosom ever since his last\r\nexpedition to the dining room. He pulled down the corners of his white\r\nwaistcoat and ran his finger round the inside of his collar. “Mrs.\r\nLippett,” he said, “I--er--I was outside the dining room just now----”\r\n\r\n“Were you, Master Willie? You must not fuss so. Everything will be quite\r\nall right.”\r\n\r\n“----and I overheard you telling Sleddon not to let me have any\r\nchampagne to-night,” said Mr. Braddock, reddening at the outrageous\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper stiffened.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did, Master Willie. And your dear mother, if she were still with\r\nus, would have given the very same instructions--after what my daughter\r\nClaire told me of what occurred the other night and the disgraceful\r\ncondition you were in. What your dear mother would have said, I don’t\r\nknow!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Lippett’s conversation during the last twenty years of Willoughby\r\nBraddock’s life had dealt largely with speculations as to what his dear\r\nmother would have said of various ventures undertaken or contemplated by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“You must fight against the craving, Master Willie. Remember your Uncle\r\nGeorge!”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock groaned in spirit. One of the things that make these old\r\nretainers so hard to bear is that they are so often walking editions of\r\nthe _chroniques scandaleuses_ of the family. It sometimes seemed to Mr.\r\nBraddock that he could not move a step in any direction without having\r\nthe awful example of some erring ancestor flung up against him.\r\n\r\n“Well, look here,” he said, with weak defiance, “I want champagne\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\n“You will have cider, Master Willie.”\r\n\r\n“But I hate cider.”\r\n\r\n“Cider is good for you, Master Willie,” said Mrs. Lippett firmly.\r\n\r\nThe argument was interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. The\r\nhousekeeper left the room, and presently Sleddon, the butler, entered,\r\nescorting Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\n“Ha, my dear fellow,” said Lord Tilbury, bustling in.\r\n\r\nHe beamed upon his host as genially as the Napoleonic cast of his\r\ncountenance would permit. He rather liked Willoughby Braddock, as he\r\nrather liked all very rich young men.\r\n\r\n“How are you?” said Mr. Braddock. “Awfully good of you to come at such\r\nshort notice.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow!”\r\n\r\nHe spoke heartily, but he had, as a matter of fact, been a little piqued\r\nat being invited to dinner on the morning of the feast. He considered\r\nthat his eminence entitled him to more formal and reverential treatment.\r\nAnd though he had accepted, having had previous experience of the\r\nexcellence of Mr. Braddock’s cook, he felt that something in the nature\r\nof an apology was due to him and was glad that it had been made.\r\n\r\n“I asked you at the last moment,” explained Mr. Braddock, “because I\r\nwasn’t sure till this morning that Sam Shotter would be able to come. I\r\nthought it would be jolly for him, meeting you out of the office, don’t\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury inclined his head. He quite saw the force of the argument\r\nthat it would be jolly for anyone, meeting him.\r\n\r\n“So you know young Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. We were at school together.”\r\n\r\n“A peculiar young fellow.”\r\n\r\n“A great lad.”\r\n\r\n“But--er--a little eccentric, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Sam always was a bit of nib,” said Mr. Braddock. “At school there\r\nused to be some iron bars across the passage outside our dormitory, the\r\nidea being to coop us up during the night, don’t you know. Sam used to\r\nshin over these and go downstairs to the house master’s study.”\r\n\r\n“With what purpose?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, just to sit.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury was regarding his host blankly. Not a day passed, he was\r\nruefully reflecting, but he received some further evidence of the light\r\nand unstable character of this young man of whom he had so rashly taken\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n“It sounds a perfectly imbecile proceeding to me,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know, you know,” said Mr. Braddock, for the defence. “You\r\nsee, occasionally there would be a cigar or a plate of biscuits or\r\nsomething left out, and then Sam would scoop them. So it wasn’t\r\naltogether a waste of time.”\r\n\r\nSleddon was entering with a tray.\r\n\r\n“Cocktail?” said Mr. Braddock, taking one himself with a defiant glare\r\nat his faithful servant, who was trying to keep the tray out of his\r\nreach.\r\n\r\n“No, I thank you,” said Lord Tilbury. “My doctor has temporarily\r\nforbidden me the use of alcoholic beverages. I have been troubled of\r\nlate with a suspicion of gout.”\r\n\r\n“Tough luck.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt I am better without them. I find cider an excellent\r\nsubstitute.... Are you expecting many people here to-night?”\r\n\r\n“A fairish number. I don’t think you know any of them--except, of\r\ncourse, old Wrenn.”\r\n\r\n“Wrenn? You mean the editor of my _Home Companion_?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He and his niece are coming. She lives with him, you know.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury started as if a bradawl had been thrust through the\r\ncushions of his chair; and for an instant, so powerfully did these words\r\naffect him, he had half a mind to bound at the receding Sleddon and,\r\nregardless of medical warnings, snatch from him that rejected cocktail.\r\nA restorative of some kind seemed to him imperative.\r\n\r\nThe statement by Mr. Wrenn, delivered in his office on the morning of\r\nSam’s arrival, that he possessed no daughter had had the effect of\r\nrelieving Lord Tilbury’s mind completely. Francie, generally so unerring\r\nin these matters, had, he decided, wronged Sam in attributing his\r\noccupancy of Mon Repos to a desire to be next door to some designing\r\ngirl. And now it appeared that she had been right all the time.\r\n\r\nHe was still staring with dismay at his unconscious host when the rest\r\nof the dinner guests began to arrive. They made no impression on his\r\ndazed mind. Through a sort of mist, he was aware of a young man with a\r\nface like a rabbit, another young man with a face like another rabbit;\r\ntwo small, shingled creatures, one blonde, the other dark, who seemed to\r\nbe either wives or sisters of these young men; and an unattached female\r\nwhom Mr. Braddock addressed as Aunt Julia. His Lordship remained aloof,\r\nburied in his thoughts and fraternising with none of them.\r\n\r\nThen Sam appeared, and a few moments later Sleddon announced Mr. Wrenn\r\nand Miss Derrick; and Lord Tilbury, who had been examining a picture by\r\nthe window, swung round with a jerk.\r\n\r\nIn a less prejudiced frame of mind he might have approved of Kay; for,\r\nlike so many other great men, he had a nice eye for feminine beauty, and\r\nshe was looking particularly attractive in a gold dress which had\r\nsurvived the wreck of Midways. But now that very beauty merely increased\r\nhis disapproval and alarm. He looked at her with horror. He glared as\r\nthe good old father in a film glares at the adventuress from whose\r\nclutches he is trying to save his only son.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, something happened that sent hope and comfort\r\nstealing through his heart. Sam, who had been seized upon by Aunt Julia\r\nand had been talking restively to her for some minutes, now contrived by\r\nan adroit piece of side-stepping to remove himself from her sphere of\r\ninfluence. He slid swiftly up to Kay, and Lord Tilbury, who was watching\r\nher closely, saw her face freeze. She said a perfunctory word or two,\r\nand then, turning away, began to talk with great animation to one of the\r\nrabbit-faced young men. And Sam, with rather the manner of one who has\r\nbumped into a brick wall in the dark, drifted off and was immediately\r\ngathered in again by Aunt Julia.\r\n\r\nA delightful sensation of relief poured over Lord Tilbury. In the days\r\nof his youth when he had attended subscription dances at the Empress\r\nRooms, West Kensington, he had sometimes seen that look on the faces of\r\nhis partners when he had happened to tread on their dresses. He knew its\r\nsignificance. Such a look could mean but one thing--that Kay, though\r\nliving next door to Sam, did not regard him as one of the pleasant\r\nfeatures of the neighbourhood. In short, felt Lord Tilbury, if there was\r\nanything between these two young people, it was something extremely\r\none-sided; and he went in to dinner with a light heart, prepared to\r\nenjoy the cooking of Mr. Braddock’s admirable chef as it should be\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nWhen, on sitting at the table, he found that Kay was on his right, he\r\nwas pleased, for he had now come to entertain a feeling of warm esteem\r\nfor this excellent and sensible girl. It was his practice never to talk\r\nwhile he ate caviare; but when that had been consumed in a holy silence\r\nhe turned to her, beaming genially.\r\n\r\n“I understand you live at Valley Fields, Miss Derrick.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“A charming spot.”\r\n\r\n“Very.”\r\n\r\n“The college grounds are very attractive.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you visited the picture gallery?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, several times.”\r\n\r\nFish arrived--_sole meunière_. It was Lord Tilbury’s custom never to\r\ntalk during the fish course.\r\n\r\n“My young friend Shotter is, I believe, a near neighbour of yours,” he\r\nsaid, when the _sole meunière_ was no more.\r\n\r\n“He lives next door.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? Then you see a great deal of him, no doubt?”\r\n\r\n“I never see him.”\r\n\r\n“A most delightful young fellow,” said Lord Tilbury, sipping cider.\r\n\r\nKay looked at him stonily.\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” she said.\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury’s last doubts were removed. He felt that all was for the\r\nbest in the best of all possible worlds. Like some joyous reveller out\r\nof Rabelais, he raised his glass with a light-hearted flourish. He\r\nlooked as if he were about to start a drinking chorus.\r\n\r\n“Excellent cider, this, Braddock,” he boomed genially. “Most\r\nexcellent.”\r\n\r\nWilloughby Braddock, who had been eying his own supply of that wholesome\r\nbeverage with sullen dislike, looked at him in pained silence; and Sam,\r\nwho had been sitting glumly, listening without interest to the prattle\r\nof one of the shingled girls, took it upon himself to reply. He was\r\nfeeling sad and ill used. That incident before dinner had distressed\r\nhim. Moreover, only a moment ago he had caught Kay’s eye for an instant\r\nacross the table, and it had been cold and disdainful. He welcomed the\r\nopportunity of spoiling somebody’s life, and particularly that of an old\r\nass like Lord Tilbury, who should have been thinking about the hereafter\r\ninstead of being so infernally hearty.\r\n\r\n“I read a very interesting thing about cider the other day,” he said in\r\na loud, compelling voice that stopped one of the rabbit-faced young men\r\nin mid-anecdote as if he had been smitten with an axe. “It appears that\r\nthe farmers down in Devonshire put a dead rat in every barrel----”\r\n\r\n“My dear Shotter!”\r\n\r\n“----to give it body,” went on Sam doggedly. “And the curious thing is\r\nthat when the barrels are opened, the rats are always found to have\r\ncompletely disappeared--showing the power of the juice.”\r\n\r\nA wordless exclamation proceeded from Lord Tilbury. He lowered his\r\nglass. Mr. Braddock was looking like one filled with a sudden great\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n“I read it in Pyke’s _Home Companion_,” said Sam. “So it must be true.”\r\n\r\n“A little water, please,” said Lord Tilbury stiffly.\r\n\r\n“Sleddon,” said Mr. Braddock in a voice of thunder, “give me some\r\nchampagne.”\r\n\r\n“Sir?” quavered the butler. He cast a swift look over his shoulder, as\r\nif seeking the moral support of Mrs. Lippett. But Mrs. Lippett was in\r\nthe housekeeper’s room.\r\n\r\n“Sleddon!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said the butler meekly.\r\n\r\nSam was feeling completely restored to his usual sunny self.\r\n\r\n“Talking of Pyke’s _Home Companion_,” he said, “did you take my advice\r\nand read that serial of Cordelia Blair’s, Lord Tilbury?”\r\n\r\n“I did not,” replied His Lordship shortly.\r\n\r\n“You should. Miss Blair is a very remarkable woman.”\r\n\r\nKay raised her eyes.\r\n\r\n“A great friend of yours, isn’t she?” she said.\r\n\r\n“I would hardly say that. I’ve only met her once.”\r\n\r\n“But you got on very well with her, I heard.”\r\n\r\n“I think I endeared myself to her pretty considerably.”\r\n\r\n“So I understood.”\r\n\r\n“I gave her a plot for a story,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nOne of the rabbit-faced young men said that he could never understand\r\nhow fellows--or women, for that matter--thought up ideas for stories--or\r\nplays, for the matter of that--or, as a matter of fact, any sort of\r\nideas, for that matter.\r\n\r\n“This,” Sam explained, “was something that actually happened--to a\r\nfriend of mine.”\r\n\r\nThe other rabbit-faced young man said that something extremely rummy had\r\nonce happened to a pal of his. He had forgotten what it was, but it had\r\nstruck him at the time as distinctly rummy.\r\n\r\n“This fellow,” said Sam, “was fishing up in Canada. He lived in a sort\r\nof shack.”\r\n\r\n“A what?” asked the blonde shingled girl.\r\n\r\n“A hut. And tacked up on the wall of the shack was a photograph of a\r\ngirl, torn out of an illustrated weekly paper.”\r\n\r\n“Pretty?” asked the dark shingled girl.\r\n\r\n“You bet she was pretty,” said Sam devoutly. “Well, this man spent weeks\r\nin absolute solitude, with not a soul to talk to--nothing, in fact, to\r\ndistract his mind from the photograph. The consequence was that he came\r\nto look on this girl as--well, you might say an old friend.”\r\n\r\n“Sleddon,” said Mr. Braddock, “more champagne.”\r\n\r\n“Some months later,” proceeded Sam, “the man came over to England. He\r\nmet the girl. And still looking on her as an old friend, you understand,\r\nhe lost his head and, two minutes after they had met, he kissed her.”\r\n\r\n“Must have been rather a soppy kind of a silly sort of idiot,” observed\r\nthe blonde shingled girl critically.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you’re right,” agreed Sam. “Still, that’s what happened.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see where the story comes in,” said one of the rabbit-faced\r\nyoung men.\r\n\r\n“Well, naturally, you see, not realising the true state of affairs, the\r\ngirl was very sore,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-faced young men looked at each other and shook their heads.\r\nThe shingled young women raised their eyebrows pityingly.\r\n\r\n“No good,” said the blonde shingled girl.\r\n\r\n“Dud,” said the dark shingled girl. “Who’s going to believe nowadays\r\nthat a girl is such a chump as to mind a man kissing her?”\r\n\r\n“Everybody kisses everybody nowadays,” said one of the rabbit-faced\r\nyoung men profoundly.\r\n\r\n“Girl was making a fuss about nothing,” said the other rabbit-faced\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n“And how does the story end?” asked Aunt Julia.\r\n\r\n“It hasn’t ended,” said Sam. “Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“Sleddon!” said Mr. Braddock, in a quiet, dangerous voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nIt is possible, if you are young and active and in an exhilarated frame\r\nof mind, to walk from John Street, Mayfair, to Burberry Road, Valley\r\nFields. Sam did so. His frame of mind was extraordinarily exhilarated.\r\nIt seemed to him, reviewing recent events, that he had detected in Kay’s\r\neyes for an instant a look that resembled the first dawning of spring\r\nafter a hard winter; and, though not in the costume for athletic feats,\r\nhe covered the seven miles that separated him from home at a pace which\r\ndrew derisive comment from the proletariat all along the route. The\r\nSurrey-side Londoner is always intrigued by the spectacle of anyone\r\nhurrying, and when that person is in dress clothes and a tall hat he\r\nexpresses himself without reserve.\r\n\r\nSam heard nothing of this ribaldry. Unconscious of the world, he strode\r\nalong, brushing through Brixton, hurrying through Herne Hill, and\r\npresently arrived, warm and happy, at the door of Mon Repos.\r\n\r\nHe let himself in; and, entering, was aware of a note lying on the hall\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nHe opened it absently. The handwriting was strange to him, and feminine:\r\n\r\n     “DEAR MR. SHOTTER: I should be much obliged if you would ask your\r\n     manservant not to chirrup at me out of trees.\r\n\r\n                             “Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                            “KAY DERRICK.”\r\n\r\nHe had to read this curt communication twice before he was able fully to\r\ngrasp its meaning. When he did so a flood of self-pity poured over Sam.\r\nHe quivered with commiseration for the hardness of his lot. Here was he,\r\ndoing all that a man could to establish pleasant neighbourly relations\r\nwith the house next door, and all the while Hash foiling his every\r\neffort by chirruping out of trees from morning till night. It was\r\nbitter, bitter.\r\n\r\nHe was standing there, feeding his surging wrath by a third perusal of\r\nthe letter, when from the direction of the kitchen there suddenly\r\nsounded a long, loud, agonised cry. It was like the wail of a soul in\r\ntorment; and without stopping to pick up his hat, which he had dropped\r\nin the sheer shock of this dreadful sound, he raced down the stairs.\r\n\r\n“’Ullo,” said Hash, looking up from an evening paper. “Back?”\r\n\r\nHis placidity amazed Sam. If his ears were any guide, murder had been\r\ndone in this room only a few seconds before, and here was this iron man\r\nreading the racing news without having turned a hair.\r\n\r\n“What on earth was that?”\r\n\r\n“What was what?”\r\n\r\n“That noise.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that was Amy,” said Hash.\r\n\r\nSam’s eye was diverted by movement in progress in the shadows behind the\r\ntable. A vast shape was rising from the floor, revealing itself as an\r\nenormous dog. It finished rising; and having placed its chin upon the\r\ntable, stood looking at him with dreamy eyes and a wrinkled forehead,\r\nlike a shortsighted person trying to recall a face.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Sam, remembering. “So you got him?”\r\n\r\n“Her.”\r\n\r\n“What is he--she?”\r\n\r\n“Gawd knows,” said Hash simply. It was a problem which he himself had\r\nendeavoured idly to solve earlier in the evening. “I’ve named her after\r\nan old aunt of mine. Looks a bit like her.”\r\n\r\n“She must be an attractive woman.”\r\n\r\n“She’s dead.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it’s all for the best,” said Sam. He leaned forward and pulled\r\nthe animal’s ears in friendly fashion. Amy simpered in a ladylike way,\r\nwell pleased. “Would you say she was a bloodhound, Hash?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t say she was anything, not to swear to.”\r\n\r\n“A kind of canine cocktail,” said Sam. “The sort of thing a Cruft’s Show\r\njudge dreams about when he has a nightmare.”\r\n\r\nHe observed something lying on the floor; and stooping, found that his\r\novertures to the animal had caused Kay’s note to slip from his fingers.\r\nHe picked it up and eyed Hash sternly. Amy, charmed by his recent\r\nattentions, snuffled like water going down the waste pipe of a bath.\r\n\r\n“Hash!” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“’Ullo?”\r\n\r\n“What the devil,” demanded Sam forcefully, “do you mean by chirruping at\r\nMiss Derrick out of trees?”\r\n\r\n“I only said oo-oo, Sam,” pleaded Mr. Todhunter.\r\n\r\n“You said what?”\r\n\r\n“Oo-oo!”\r\n\r\n“What on earth did you want to say oo-oo for?”\r\n\r\nMuch voyaging on the high seas had given Hash’s cheeks the consistency\r\nof teak, but at this point something resembling a blush played about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was the girl.”\r\n\r\n“What girl?”\r\n\r\n“The maid. Clara, ’er name is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why should you say oo-oo at her?”\r\n\r\nAgain that faint, fleeting blush coloured Hash’s face. Before Sam’s\r\nrevolted eyes he suddenly looked coy.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s like this, Sam: The ’ole thing ’ere is, we’re engaged.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Engaged to be married.”\r\n\r\n“Engaged!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Mr. Todhunter. And once more that repellent smirk rendered\r\nhis features hideous beyond even Nature’s liberal specifications\r\nconcerning them.\r\n\r\nSam sat down. This extraordinary confession had shaken him deeply.\r\n\r\n“You’re engaged?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“But I thought you disliked women.”\r\n\r\n“So I do--most of ’em.”\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the matter struck Sam. His astonishment deepened.\r\n\r\n“But how did you manage it so soon?”\r\n\r\n“Soon?”\r\n\r\n“You can’t have seen the girl more than about half a dozen times.”\r\n\r\nStill another mysterious point about this romance presented itself to\r\nSam. He regarded the great lover with frank curiosity.\r\n\r\n“And what was the attraction?” he asked. “That’s what I can’t\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a nice girl,” argued Hash.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean in her; I mean in you. What is there about you that could\r\nmake this misguided female commit such a rash act? If I were a girl, and\r\nyou begged me for one little rose from my hair, I wouldn’t give it to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“But----”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Sam firmly, “it’s no use arguing; I just wouldn’t give it to\r\nyou. What did she see in you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well----”\r\n\r\n“It couldn’t have been your looks--we’ll dismiss that right away, of\r\ncourse. It couldn’t have been your conversation or your intellect,\r\nbecause you haven’t any. Then what was it?”\r\n\r\nMr. Todhunter smirked coyly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, I’ve got a way with me, Sam--that’s how it is.”\r\n\r\n“A way?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“What sort of way?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, just a way.”\r\n\r\n“Have you got it with you now?”\r\n\r\n“Naturally I wouldn’t ’ave it with me now,” said Hash.\r\n\r\n“You keep it for special occasions, eh? Well, you haven’t yet explained\r\nhow it all happened.”\r\n\r\nMr. Todhunter coughed.\r\n\r\n“Well, it was like this, Sam: I see ’er in the garden, and I says\r\n‘Ullo!’ and she says ‘Ullo!’ and then she come to the fence and then I\r\ncome to the fence, and she says ‘Ullo!’ and I says ‘Ullo!’ and then I\r\nkiss her.”\r\n\r\nSam gaped.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t she object?”\r\n\r\n“Object? What would she want to object for? No, indeed! It seemed to\r\nbreak what you might call the ice, and after that everything got kind of\r\nnice and matey. And then one thing led to another--see what I mean?”\r\n\r\nAn aching sense of the injustice of things afflicted Sam.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s very strange,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What’s strange?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, I knew a man--a fellow--who--er--kissed a girl when he had only\r\njust met her, and she was furious.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Hash, leaping instantly at a plausible solution, “but then ’e\r\nwas probably a chap with a face like Gawd-’elpus and hair growing out\r\nof his ears. Naturally, no one wouldn’t like ’aving someone like that\r\nkissing ’em.”\r\n\r\nSam went upstairs to bed. Before retiring, he looked at himself in the\r\nmirror long and earnestly. He turned his head sideways so that the light\r\nshone upon his ears. He was conscious of a strange despondency.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nKay lay in bed, thinking. Ever and anon a little chuckle escaped her.\r\nShe was feeling curiously happy to-night. The world seemed to have\r\nbecome all of a sudden interesting and amusing. An odd, uncontrollable\r\nimpulse urged her to sing.\r\n\r\nShe would not in any case have sung for long, for she was a considerate\r\ngirl, and the recollection would soon have come to her that there were\r\npeople hard by who were trying to get to sleep. But, as a matter of\r\nfact, she sang only a mere bar or two, for even as she began, there came\r\na muffled banging on the wall--a petulant banging. Hash Todhunter loved\r\nhis Claire, but he was not prepared to put up with this sort of thing.\r\nThree doughty buffets he dealt the wall with the heel of a number-eleven\r\nshoe.\r\n\r\nKay sang no more. She turned out the light and lay in the darkness, her\r\nface set.\r\n\r\nSilence fell upon San Rafael and Mon Repos. And then, from somewhere in\r\nthe recesses of the latter, a strange, bansheelike wailing began. Amy\r\nwas homesick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES OF THE DOG AMY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day that followed Mr. Braddock’s dinner party dawned on a world\r\nshrouded in wet white fog. By eight o’clock, however, this had thinned\r\nto a soft, pearly veil that hung clingingly to the tree tops and\r\nlingered about the grass of the lawn in little spiderwebs of moisture.\r\nAnd when Kay Derrick came out into the garden, a quarter of an hour\r\nlater, the September sun was already beginning to pierce the mist with\r\nhints of a wonderful day to come.\r\n\r\nIt was the sort of morning which should have bred happiness and quiet\r\ncontent, but Kay had waked in a mood of irritated hostility which fine\r\nweather could not dispel. What had happened overnight had stung her to a\r\nmilitant resentment, and sleep had not removed this.\r\n\r\nPossibly this was because her sleep, like that of everyone else in the\r\nneighbourhood, had been disturbed and intermittent. From midnight until\r\ntwo in the morning the dog Amy had given a spirited imitation of ten\r\ndogs being torn asunder by red-hot pincers. At two, Hash Todhunter had\r\nrisen reluctantly from his bed, and arming himself with the\r\nnumber-eleven shoe mentioned in the previous chapter, had reasoned with\r\nher. This had produced a brief respite, but by a quarter of three large\r\nnumbers of dogs were once more being massacred on the premises of Mon\r\nRepos, that ill-named house.\r\n\r\nAt three, Sam went down; and being a young man who liked dogs and saw\r\ntheir point of view, tried diplomacy. This took the shape of the remains\r\nof a leg of mutton and it worked like a charm. Amy finished the leg of\r\nmutton and fell into a surfeited slumber, and peace descended on\r\nBurberry Road.\r\n\r\nKay paced the gravel path with hard feelings, which were not removed by\r\nthe appearance a few moments later of Sam, clad in flannels and a\r\nsweater. Sam, his back to her and his face to the sun, began to fling\r\nhimself about in a forceful and hygienic manner; and Kay, interested in\r\nspite of herself, came to the fence to watch him. She was angry with\r\nhim, for no girl likes to have her singing criticised by bangs upon the\r\nwall; but nevertheless she could not entirely check a faint feeling of\r\napproval as she watched him. A country-bred girl, Kay liked men to be\r\nstrong and of the open air; and Sam, whatever his moral defects, was a\r\nfine physical specimen. He looked fit and hard and sinewy.\r\n\r\nPresently, in the course of a complicated movement which involved\r\ncircular swinging from the waist, his eye fell upon her. He straightened\r\nhimself and came over to the fence, flushed and tousled and healthy.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said Kay coldly. “I want to apologise, Mr. Shotter. I’m\r\nafraid my singing disturbed you last night.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” said Sam. “Was that you? I thought it was the dog.”\r\n\r\n“I stopped directly you banged on the wall.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t bang on any wall. It must have been Hash.”\r\n\r\n“Hash?”\r\n\r\n“Hash Todhunter, the man who cooks for me--and, oh, yes, who chirrups at\r\nyou out of trees. I got your note and spoke to him about it. He\r\nexplained that he had mistaken you for your maid, Claire. It’s rather a\r\nromantic story. He’s engaged to her.”\r\n\r\n“Engaged!”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I said when he told me, and in just that tone of\r\nvoice. I was surprised. I gather, however, that Hash is what you would\r\ncall a quick worker. He tells me he has a way with him. According to his\r\nstory, he kissed her, and after that everything was nice and matey.”\r\n\r\nKay flushed faintly.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. The San Rafael kitten, which had been playing in\r\nthe grass, approached and rubbed a wet head against Kay’s ankle.\r\n\r\n“Well, I must be going in,” said Kay. “Claire is in bed with one of her\r\nneuralgic headaches and I have to cook my uncle’s breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, really? Let me lend you Todhunter.”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you’re wise. Apart from dry hash, he’s a rotten cook.”\r\n\r\n“So is Claire.”\r\n\r\n“Really? What a battle of giants it will be when they start cooking for\r\neach other!”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nKay stooped and tickled the kitten under the ear, then walked quickly\r\ntoward the house. The kitten, having subjected Sam to a long and\r\ncritical scrutiny, decided that he promised little entertainment to an\r\nactive-minded cat and galloped off in pursuit of a leaf. Sam sighed and\r\nwent in to have a bath.\r\n\r\nSome little time later, the back door of Mon Repos opened from within as\r\nif urged by some irresistible force, and the dog Amy came out to take\r\nthe morning air.\r\n\r\nDogs are creatures of swiftly changing moods. Only a few hours before,\r\nAmy, in the grip of a dreadful depression caused by leaving the public\r\nhouse where she had spent her girlhood--for, in case the fact is of\r\ninterest to anyone, Hash had bought her for five shillings from the\r\nproprietor of the Blue Anchor at Tulse Hill--had been making the night\r\nhideous with her lamentations. Like Rachel, she had mourned and would\r\nnot be comforted. But now, to judge from her manner and a certain\r\njauntiness in her walk, she had completely resigned herself to the life\r\nof exile. She scratched the turf and sniffed the shrubs with the air of\r\na lady of property taking a stroll round her estates. And when Hash, who\r\ndid not easily forgive, flung an egg at her out of the kitchen window so\r\nthat it burst before her on the gravel, she ate the remains\r\nlightheartedly, as one who feels that the day is beginning well.\r\n\r\nThe only flaw in the scheme of things seemed to her to consist in a\r\nlack of society. By nature sociable, she yearned for company, and for\r\nsome minutes roamed the garden in quest of it. She found a snail under a\r\nlaurel bush, but snails are reserved creatures, self-centred and\r\noccupied with their own affairs, and this one cut Amy dead, retreating\r\ninto its shell with a frigid aloofness which made anything in the nature\r\nof camaraderie out of the question.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the path, and became interested in the wooden structure\r\nthat ran along it. Rearing herself up to a majestic height and placing\r\nher paws on this, she looked over and immediately experienced all the\r\nemotions of stout Balboa when with eagle eyes he stared at the Pacific.\r\nIt is not indeed, too much to say that Amy at that moment felt like some\r\nwatcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken; for not only\r\nwas there a complete new world on the other side of this wooden\r\nstructure but on the grass in the middle of it was a fascinating kitten\r\nrunning round in circles after its tail.\r\n\r\nAmy had seen enough. She would have preferred another dog to chat with;\r\nbut failing that, a kitten made an admirable substitute. She adored\r\nkittens. At the Blue Anchor there had been seven, all intimate friends\r\nof hers, who looked upon her body as a recreation ground and her massive\r\ntail as a perpetual object of the chase. With a heave of her powerful\r\nhind legs, she hoisted herself over the fence and, descending on the\r\nother side like the delivery of half a ton of coal, bounded at the\r\nkitten, full of good feeling. And the kitten, after one brief, shocked\r\nstare, charged madly at the fence and scrambled up it into the branches\r\nof the tree from which Hash Todhunter had done his recent chirruping.\r\n\r\nAmy came to the foot of the tree and looked up, perplexed. She could\r\nmake nothing of this. It is not given to dogs any more than to men to\r\nsee themselves as others see them, and it never occurred to her for an\r\ninstant that there was in her appearance anything that might be alarming\r\nto a high-strung young cat. But a dog cannot have a bloodhound-Airedale\r\nfather and a Great Dane-Labrador mother without acquiring a certain\r\nphysique. The kitten, peering down through the branches, congratulated\r\nitself on a narrow escape from death and climbed higher. And at this\r\npoint Kay came out into the garden.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, dog,” said Kay. “What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nAmy was glad to see Kay. She was a shortsighted dog and took her for the\r\ndaughter of the host of the Blue Boar who had been wont to give her her\r\nmeals. She left the tree and galloped toward her. And Kay, who had been\r\nbrought up with dogs from childhood and knew the correct procedure to be\r\nobserved when meeting a strange one, welcomed her becomingly. Hash,\r\nhurrying out on observing Amy leap the fence, found himself a witness of\r\nwhat practically amounted to a feast of reason and a flow of soul. That\r\nis to say, Amy was lying restfully on her back with her legs in the air\r\nand Kay was thumping her chest.\r\n\r\n“I hope the dog is not annoying you, lady,” said Hash in his best\r\n_preux-chevalier_ manner.\r\n\r\nKay looked up and perceived the man who had chirruped at her from the\r\ntree. Having contracted to marry into San Rafael, he had ceased to be\r\nan alien and had become something in the nature of one of the family; so\r\nshe smiled amiably at him, conscious the while of a passing wonder that\r\nClaire’s heart should have been ensnared by one who, whatever his\r\nmerits, was notably deficient in conventional good looks.\r\n\r\n“Not at all, thank you,” she said. “Is he your dog?”\r\n\r\n“She,” corrected Hash. “Yes, miss.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a nice dog.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, miss,” said Hash, but with little heartiness.\r\n\r\n“I hope she won’t frighten my kitten, though. It’s out in the garden\r\nsomewhere. I can hear it mewing.”\r\n\r\nAmy could hear the mewing too; and still hopeful that an understanding\r\nmight be reached, she at once proceeded to the tree and endeavoured to\r\njump to the top of it. In this enterprise she fell short by some fifty\r\nfeet, but she jumped high enough to send the kitten scrambling into the\r\nupper branches.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Kay, appreciating the situation.\r\n\r\nHash also appreciated the situation; and being a man of deeds rather\r\nthan words, vaulted over the fence and kicked Amy in the lower ribs.\r\nAmy, her womanly feelings wounded, shot back into her own garden, where\r\nshe stood looking plaintively on with her forepaws on the fence.\r\nTreatment like this was novel to her, for at the Blue Anchor she had\r\nbeen something of a popular pet; and it seemed to her that she had\r\nfallen among tough citizens. She expressed a not unnatural pique by\r\nthrowing her head back and uttering a loud, moaning cry like an ocean\r\nliner in a fog. Hearing which, the kitten, which had been in two minds\r\nabout risking a descent, climbed higher.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” said Kay.\r\n\r\n“Shut up!” bellowed Hash. “Not you, miss,” he hastened to add with a\r\ngallant smirk. “I was speaking to the dog.” He found a clod of earth and\r\nflung it peevishly at Amy, who wrinkled her forehead thoughtfully as it\r\nflew by, but made no move. Amy’s whole attitude now was that of one who\r\nhas got a front-row seat and means to keep it. “The ’ole thing ’ere,”\r\nexplained Hash, “is that that there cat is scared to come down, bein’\r\nfrightened of this ’ere dog.”\r\n\r\nAnd having cleared up what might otherwise have remained a permanent\r\nmystery, he plucked a blade of grass and chewed reflectively.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” said Kay, with an ingratiating smile, “if you would mind\r\nclimbing up and getting her.”\r\n\r\nHash stared at her amazedly. Her smile, which was wont to have so much\r\neffect on so many people, left him cold. It was the silliest suggestion\r\nhe had ever heard in his life.\r\n\r\n“Me?” he said, marvelling. “You mean me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Climb up this ’ere tree and fetch that there cat?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Lady,” said Hash, “do you think I’m an acrobat or something?”\r\n\r\nKay bit her lips. Then, looking over the fence, she observed Sam\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\n“Anything wrong?” said Sam.\r\n\r\nKay regarded him with mixed feelings. She had an uneasy foreboding that\r\nit might be injudicious to put herself under an obligation to a young\r\nman so obviously belonging to the class of those who, given an inch,\r\ntake an ell. On the other hand, the kitten, mewing piteously, had\r\nplainly got itself into a situation from which only skilled assistance\r\ncould release it. She eyed Sam doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Your dog has frightened my kitten up the tree,” she said.\r\n\r\nA wave of emotion poured over Sam. Only yesterday he had been correcting\r\nthe proofs of a short story designed for a forthcoming issue of Pyke’s\r\n_Home Companion_--_Celia’s Airman_, by Louise G. Boffin--and had curled\r\nhis lip with superior masculine scorn at what had seemed to him the\r\nnaïve sentimentality of its central theme. Celia had quarrelled with her\r\nlover, a young wing commander in the air force, and they had become\r\nreconciled owing to the latter saving her canary. In a mad moment in\r\nwhich his critical faculties must have been completely blurred, Sam had\r\nthought the situation far-fetched; but now he offered up a silent\r\napology to Miss Boffin, realising that it was from the sheer, stark\r\nfacts of life that she had drawn her inspiration.\r\n\r\n“You want her brought down?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do.”\r\n\r\n“Leave it to me,” said Sam. “Leave it absolutely to me--leave the whole\r\nthing entirely and completely to me.”\r\n\r\n“It’s awfully good of you.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Sam tenderly. “There is nothing I wouldn’t do for\r\nyou--nothing. I was saying to myself only just now----”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t,” said Hash heavily. “Only go breaking your neck. What we\r\nought to do ’ere is to stand under the tree and chirrup.”\r\n\r\nSam frowned.\r\n\r\n“You appear to me, Hash,” he said with some severity, “to think that\r\nyour mission in life is to chirrup. If you devoted half the time to work\r\nthat you do to practicing your chirruping, Mon Repos would be a better\r\nand a sweeter place.”\r\n\r\nHe hoisted himself into the tree and began to climb rapidly. So much\r\nprogress did he make that when, a few moments later, Kay called to him,\r\nhe could not distinguish her words. He scrambled down again.\r\n\r\n“What did you say?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I only said take care,” said Kay.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his climb. Hash followed him with a pessimistic eye.\r\n\r\n“A cousin of mine broke two ribs playing this sort of silly game,” he\r\nsaid moodily. “Light-haired feller named George Turner. Had a job\r\npruning the ellums on a gentleman’s place down Chigwell way. Two ribs he\r\nbroke, besides a number of contusions.”\r\n\r\nHe was aggrieved to find that Kay was not giving that attention to the\r\nstory which its drama and human interest deserved.\r\n\r\n“Two ribs,” he repeated in a louder voice. “Also cuts, scratches and\r\ncontusions. Ellums are treacherous things. You think the branches is all\r\nright, but lean your weight on ’em and they snap. That’s an ellum he’s\r\nclimbing now.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, be quiet!” said Kay nervously. She was following Sam’s movements as\r\ntensely as ever Celia followed her airman’s. It did look horribly\r\ndangerous, what he was doing.\r\n\r\n“The proper thing we ought to have done ’ere was to have took a blanket\r\nand a ladder and a pole and to have held the blanket spread out and\r\nclimbed the ladder and prodded at that there cat with the pole, same as\r\nthey do at fires,” said Hash, casting an unwarrantable slur on the\r\nhumane methods of the fire brigade.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well done!” cried Kay.\r\n\r\nSam was now operating in the topmost branches, and the kitten, not being\r\nable to retreat farther, had just come within reach of his groping hand.\r\nHaving regarded him suspiciously for some moments and registered a\r\nformal protest against the proceedings by making a noise like an\r\nexploding soda-water bottle, it now allowed itself to be picked up and\r\nbuttoned into his coat.\r\n\r\n“Splendid!” shouted Kay.\r\n\r\n“What?” bellowed Sam, peering down.\r\n\r\n“I said splendid!” roared Kay.\r\n\r\n“The lady said splendid!” yelled Hash, in a voice strengthened by long\r\npractice in announcing dinner in the midst of hurricanes. He turned to\r\nKay with a mournful shaking of the head, his bearing that of the man who\r\nhas tried to put a brave face on the matter, but feels the uselessness\r\nof affecting further optimism. “It’s now that’s the dangerous part,\r\nmiss,” he said. “The coming down, what I mean. I don’t say the climbing\r\nup of one of these ’ere ellums is safe--not what you would call safe;\r\nbut it’s when you’re coming down that the nasty accidents occur. My\r\ncousin was coming down when he broke his two ribs and got all them\r\ncontusions. George Turner his name was--a light-haired feller, and he\r\nbroke two ribs and had to have seven stitches sewed in him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Kay.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Hash.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with something of the smug self-satisfaction of the prophet\r\nwhose predicted disasters come off as per schedule. Half-way down the\r\ntree, Sam, like Mr. Turner, had found proof of the treachery of ellums.\r\nHe had rested his weight on a branch which looked solid, felt solid and\r\nshould have been solid, and it had snapped under him. For one breathless\r\nmoment he seemed to be about to shoot down like Lucifer, then he\r\nsnatched at another bough and checked his fall.\r\n\r\nThis time the bough held. It was as if the elm, having played its\r\npractical joke and failed, had become discouraged. Hash, with something\r\nof the feelings of a spectator in the gallery at a melodrama who sees\r\nthe big scene fall flat, watched his friend and employer reach the\r\nlowest branch and drop safely to the ground. The record of George Turner\r\nstill remained a mark for other climbers to shoot at.\r\n\r\nKay was not a girl who wept easily, but she felt strangely close to\r\ntears. She removed the agitated kitten from Sam’s coat and put it on the\r\ngrass, where it immediately made another spirited attempt to climb the\r\ntree. Foiled in this, it raced for the coal cellar and disappeared from\r\nthe social life of San Rafael until late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n“Your poor hands!” said Kay.\r\n\r\nSam regarded his palms with some surprise. In the excitement of the\r\nrecent passage he had been unaware of injury.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” he said. “Only skinned a little.”\r\n\r\nHash would have none of this airy indifference.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” he said, “and the next thing you know you’ll be getting dirt into\r\n’em and going down with lockjaw. I had an uncle what got dirt into a cut\r\n’and, and three days later we were buying our blacks for him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” gasped Kay.\r\n\r\n“Two and a half, really,” said Hash. “Because he expired toward\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll run and get a sponge and a basin,” said Kay in agitation.\r\n\r\n“That’s awfully good of you,” said Sam. Oh, woman, he felt, in our hours\r\nof ease uncertain, coy and hard to please; when pain and anguish rack\r\nthe brow, a ministering angel thou. And he nearly said as much.\r\n\r\n“You don’t want to do that, miss,” said Hash. “Much simpler for him to\r\ncome indoors and put ’em under the tap.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that would be better,” agreed Kay.\r\n\r\nSam regarded his practical-minded subordinate with something of the\r\ninjured loathing which his cooking had occasionally caused to appear on\r\nthe faces of dainty feeders in the fo’c’sle of the _Araminta_.\r\n\r\n“This isn’t your busy day, Hash, I take it?” he said coldly.\r\n\r\n“Pardon?”\r\n\r\n“I said, you seem to be taking life pretty easily. Why don’t you do a\r\nlittle work sometimes? If you imagine you’re a lily of the field, look\r\nin the glass and adjust that impression.”\r\n\r\nHash drew himself up, wounded.\r\n\r\n“I’m only stayin’ ’ere to ’elp and encourage,” he said stiffly. “Now\r\nthat what I might call the peril is over, there’s nothing to keep me.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” agreed Sam cordially.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be going.”\r\n\r\n“You know your way,” said Sam. He turned to Kay. “Hash is an ass,” he\r\nsaid. “Put them under the tap, indeed! These hands need careful\r\ndressing.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they do,” Kay agreed.\r\n\r\n“They most certainly do.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we go in then?”\r\n\r\n“Without delay,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“There,” said Kay, some ten minutes later. “I think that will be all\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nThe finest efforts of the most skilful surgeon could not have evoked\r\nmore enthusiasm from her patient. Sam regarded his bathed and\r\nsticking-plastered hands with an admiration that was almost ecstatic.\r\n\r\n“You’ve had training in this sort of thing,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve never been a nurse?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Sam, “it is pure genius. It is just one of those cases of\r\nan amazing natural gift. You’ve probably saved my life. Oh, yes, you\r\nhave! Remember what Hash said about lockjaw.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought you thought Hash was an ass.”\r\n\r\n“In many ways, yes,” said Sam. “But on some points he has a certain\r\nrugged common sense. He----”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you be awfully late for the office?”\r\n\r\n“For the what? Oh! Well, yes, I suppose I ought to be going there. But\r\nI’ve got to have breakfast first.”\r\n\r\n“Well, hurry then. My uncle will be wondering what has become of you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. What a delightful man your uncle is!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, isn’t he! Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know when I’ve met a man I respected more.”\r\n\r\n“This will be wonderful news for him.”\r\n\r\n“So kind.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“So patient with me.”\r\n\r\n“I expect he needs to be.”\r\n\r\n“The sort of man it’s a treat to work with.”\r\n\r\n“If you hurry you’ll be able to work with him all the sooner.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sam; “yes. Er--is there any message I can give him?”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks.”\r\n\r\n“Ah? Well, then look here,” said Sam, “would you care to come and have\r\nlunch somewhere to-day?”\r\n\r\nKay hesitated. Then her eyes fell on those sticking-plastered hands and\r\nshe melted. After all, when a young man has been displaying great\r\nheroism in her service, a girl must do the decent thing.\r\n\r\n“I should like to,” she said.\r\n\r\n“The Savoy Grill at 1:30?”\r\n\r\n“All right. Are you going to bring my uncle along?”\r\n\r\nSam started.\r\n\r\n“Why--er--that would be splendid, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I forgot. He’s lunching with a man to-day at the Press Club.”\r\n\r\n“Is he?” said Sam. “Is he really?”\r\n\r\nHis affection and respect for Mr. Matthew Wrenn increased to an almost\r\noverwhelming degree. He went back to Mon Repos feeling that it was the\r\npresence in the world of men like Matthew Wrenn that gave the lie to\r\npessimism concerning the future of the human race.\r\n\r\nKay, meanwhile, in her rôle of understudy to Claire Lippett, who had\r\njust issued a bulletin to the effect that the neuralgic pains were\r\ndiminishing and that she hoped to be up and about by midday, proceeded\r\nto an energetic dusting of the house. As a rule, she hated this sort of\r\nwork, but to-day a strange feeling of gaiety stimulated her. She found\r\nherself looking forward to the lunch at the Savoy with something of the\r\neagerness which, as a child, she had felt at the approach of a party.\r\nReluctant to attribute this to the charms of a young man whom less than\r\ntwenty-four hours ago she had heartily disliked, she decided that it\r\nmust be the prospect of once more enjoying good cooking in pleasant\r\nsurroundings that was causing her excitement. Until recently she had\r\ntaken her midday meal at the home of Mrs. Winnington-Bates, and, as with\r\na celebrated chewing gum, the taste lingered.\r\n\r\nShe finished her operations in the dining room and made her way to the\r\ndrawing-room. Here the photograph of herself on the mantelpiece\r\nattracted her attention. She picked it up and stood gazing at it\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\nA sharp double rap on the front door broke in on her reflections. It\r\nwas the postman with the second delivery, and he had rapped because\r\namong his letters for San Rafael was one addressed to Kay on which the\r\nwriter had omitted to place a stamp. Kay paid the twopence and took the\r\nletter back with her to the drawing-room, hoping that the interest of\r\nits contents would justify the financial outlay.\r\n\r\nInspecting them, she decided that they did. The letter was from\r\nWilloughby Braddock; and Mr. Braddock, both writing and expressing\r\nhimself rather badly, desired to know if Kay could see her way to\r\nmarrying him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION AT A LUNCHEON TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little lobby of the Savoy grill-room that opens on to Savoy Court is\r\na restful place for meditation; and Kay, arriving there at twenty\r\nminutes past one, was glad that she was early. She needed solitude, and\r\nregretted that in another ten minutes Sam would come in and deprive her\r\nof it. Ever since she had received his letter she had been pondering\r\ndeeply on the matter of Willoughby Braddock, but had not yet succeeded\r\nin reaching a definite conclusion either in his favour or against him.\r\n\r\nIn his favour stood the fact that he had been a pleasant factor in her\r\nlife as far back as she could remember. She had bird’s-nested with him\r\non spring afternoons, she had played the mild card games of childhood\r\nwith him on winter evenings, and--as has been stated--she had sat in\r\ntrees and criticised with incisive power his habit of wearing bed socks.\r\nThese things count. Marrying Willoughby would undeniably impart a sort\r\nof restful continuity to life. On the other hand----\r\n\r\n“Hullo!”\r\n\r\nA young man, entering the lobby, had halted before her. For a moment she\r\nsupposed that it was Sam, come to bid her to the feast; then, emerging\r\nfrom her thoughts, she looked up and perceived that blot on the body\r\npolitic, Claude Winnington-Bates.\r\n\r\nHe was looking down at her with a sort of sheepish impudence, as a man\r\nwill when he encounters unexpectedly a girl who in the not distant past\r\nhas blacked his eye with a heavy volume of theological speculation. He\r\nwas a slim young man, dressed in the height of fashion. His mouth was\r\nsmall and furtive, his eyes flickered with a kind of stupid slyness, and\r\nhis hair, which mounted his head in a series of ridges or terraces,\r\nshone with the unguent affected by the young lads of the town. A messy\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” he said. “Waiting for someone?”\r\n\r\nFor a brief, wistful instant Kay wished that the years could roll back,\r\nmaking her young enough to be permitted to say some of the things she\r\nhad said to Willoughby Braddock on that summer morning long ago when the\r\ntopic of bed socks had come up between them. Being now of an age of\r\ndiscretion and so debarred from that rich eloquence, she contented\r\nherself with looking through him and saying nothing.\r\n\r\nThe treatment was not effective. Claude sat down on the lounge beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“I say, you know,” he urged, “there’s no need to be ratty. I mean to\r\nsay----”\r\n\r\nKay abandoned her policy of silence.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bates,” she said, “do you remember a boy who was at school with you\r\nnamed Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“Sam Shotter?” said Claude, delighted at her chattiness. “Oh, yes,\r\nrather. I remember Sam Shotter. Rather a bad show, that. I saw him the\r\nother night and he was absolutely----”\r\n\r\n“He’s coming here in a minute or two. And if he finds you sitting on\r\nthis lounge and I explain to him that you have been annoying me, he will\r\nprobably tear you into little bits. I should go, if I were you.”\r\n\r\nClaude Bates went. Indeed, the verb but feebly expresses the celerity of\r\nhis movement. One moment he was lolling on the lounge; the next he had\r\nceased to be and the lobby was absolutely free from him. Kay, looking\r\nover her shoulder into the grill-room, observed him drop into a chair\r\nand mop his forehead with a handkerchief.\r\n\r\nShe returned to her thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Claude had given them a new turn; or, rather, it had\r\nbrought prominently before her mind what until then had only lurked at\r\nthe back of it--the matter of Willoughby Braddock’s financial status.\r\nWilloughby Braddock was a very rich man; the girl who became Mrs.\r\nWilloughby Braddock would be a very rich woman. She would, that is to\r\nsay, step automatically into a position in life where the prowling\r\nClaude Bateses of the world would cease to be an annoyance. And this was\r\nbeyond a doubt another point in Mr. Braddock’s favour.\r\n\r\nWilloughby, moreover, was rich in the right way, in the Midways fashion,\r\nwith the richness that went with old greystone houses and old green\r\nparks and all the comfortable joy of the English country. He could give\r\nher the kind of life she had grown up in and loved. But on the other\r\nhand----\r\n\r\nKay stared thoughtfully before her; and, staring, was aware of Sam\r\nhurrying through the swing door.\r\n\r\n“I’m not late, am I?” said Sam anxiously.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\n“Then come along. Golly, what a corking day!”\r\n\r\nHe shepherded her solicitously into the grill-room and made for a table\r\nby the large window that looks out onto the court. A cloakroom waiter,\r\nwho had padded silently upon their trail, collected his hat and stick\r\nand withdrew with the air of a leopard that has made a good kill.\r\n\r\n“Nice-looking chap,” said Sam, following him with an appreciative eye.\r\n\r\n“You seem to be approving of everything and everybody this morning.”\r\n\r\n“I am. This is the maddest, merriest day of all the glad New Year, and\r\nyou can quote me as saying so. Now then, what is it to be?”\r\n\r\nHaving finished his ordering, a task which he approached on a lavish\r\nscale, Sam leaned forward and gazed fondly at his guest.\r\n\r\n“Gosh!” he said rapturously. “I never thought, when I was sitting in\r\nthat fishing hut staring at your photograph, that only a month or two\r\nlater I’d be having lunch with you at the Savoy.”\r\n\r\nKay was a little startled. Her brief acquaintance with him had taught\r\nher that Sam was a man of what might be called direct methods, but she\r\nhad never expected that he would be quite so direct as this. In his\r\nlexicon there appeared to be no such words as “reticence” and “finesse.”\r\n\r\n“What fishing hut was that?” she asked, feeling rather like a fireman\r\nturning a leaky hose on a briskly burning warehouse full of explosives.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t know it. It’s the third on the left as you enter Canada.”\r\n\r\n“Are you fond of fishing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But we won’t talk about that, if you don’t mind. Let’s stick to\r\nthe photograph.”\r\n\r\n“You keep talking about a photograph and I don’t in the least know what\r\nyou mean.”\r\n\r\n“The photograph I was speaking of at the dinner last night.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the one your friend found--of some girl.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t a friend; it was me. And it wasn’t some girl; it was you.”\r\n\r\nHere the waiter intruded, bearing _hors d’œuvres_. Kay lingered over her\r\nselection, but the passage of time had not the effect of diverting her\r\nhost from his chosen topic. Kay began to feel that nothing short of an\r\nearthquake would do that, and probably not even an earthquake unless it\r\ncompletely wrecked the grill-room.\r\n\r\n“I remember the first time I saw that photograph.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder which it was,” said Kay casually.\r\n\r\n“It was----”\r\n\r\n“So long as it wasn’t the one of me sitting in a sea shell at the age of\r\ntwo, I don’t mind.”\r\n\r\n“It was----”\r\n\r\n“They told me that if I was very good and sat very still, I should see a\r\nbird come out of the camera. I don’t believe it ever did. And why they\r\nlet me appear in a costume like that, even at the age of two, I can’t\r\nimagine.”\r\n\r\n“It was the one of you in a riding habit, standing by your horse.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that one?... I think I will take eggs after all.”\r\n\r\n“Eggs? What eggs?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. _Œufs à la_ something, weren’t they?”\r\n\r\n“Wait!” said Sam. He spoke as one groping his way through a maze.\r\n“Somehow or other we seem to have got onto the subject of eggs. I don’t\r\nwant to talk about eggs.”\r\n\r\n“Though I’m not positive it was à la something. I believe it was _œufs\r\nMarseillaises_ or some word like that. Anyhow, just call the waiter and\r\nsay eggs.”\r\n\r\nSam called the waiter and said eggs. The waiter appeared not only to\r\nunderstand but to be gratified.\r\n\r\n“The first time I saw that photograph----” he resumed.\r\n\r\n“I wonder why they call those eggs _œufs Marseillaises_,” said Kay\r\npensively. “Do you think it’s a special sort of egg they have in\r\nMarseilles.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t say. You know,” said Sam, “I’m not really frightfully\r\ninterested in eggs.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever been in Marseilles?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I went there once with the _Araminta_.”\r\n\r\n“Who is _Araminta_?”\r\n\r\n“The _Araminta_. A tramp steamer I’ve made one or two trips on.”\r\n\r\n“What fun! Tell me all about your trips on the _Araminta_.”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing to tell.”\r\n\r\n“Was that where you met the man you call Hash?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He was the cook. Weren’t you surprised,” said Sam, beginning to\r\nsee his way, “when you heard that he was engaged to Claire?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Kay, regretting that she had shown interest in tramp\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\n“It just shows----”\r\n\r\n“I suppose the drawback to going about on small boats like that is the\r\nfood. It’s difficult to get fresh vegetables, I should think--and eggs.”\r\n\r\n“Life isn’t all eggs,” said Sam desperately.\r\n\r\nThe head waiter, a paternal man, halted at the table and inquired if\r\neverything was to the satisfaction of the lady and gentleman. The lady\r\nreplied brightly that everything was perfect. The gentleman grunted.\r\n\r\n“They’re very nice here,” said Kay. “They make you feel as if they were\r\nfond of you.”\r\n\r\n“If they weren’t nice to you,” said Sam vehemently, “they ought to be\r\nshot. And I’d like to see the fellow who wouldn’t be fond of you.”\r\n\r\nKay began to have a sense of defeat, not unlike that which comes to a\r\nscientific boxer who has held off a rushing opponent for several rounds\r\nand feels himself weakening.\r\n\r\n“The first time I saw that photograph,” said Sam, “was one night when I\r\nhad come in tired out after a day’s fishing.”\r\n\r\n“Talking about fish----”\r\n\r\n“It was pretty dark in the hut, with only an oil lamp on the table, and\r\nI didn’t notice it at first. Then, when I was having a smoke after\r\ndinner, my eye caught something tacked up on the wall. I went across to\r\nhave a look, and, by Jove, I nearly dropped the lamp!”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why? Because it was such a shock.”\r\n\r\n“So hideous?”\r\n\r\n“So lovely, so radiant, so beautiful, so marvellous.”\r\n\r\n“I see.”\r\n\r\n“So heavenly, so----”\r\n\r\n“Yes? There’s Claude Bates over at that table.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of these words on her companion was so electrical that it\r\nseemed to Kay that she had at last discovered a theme which would take\r\nhis mind off other and disconcerting topics. Sam turned a dull crimson;\r\nhis eyes hardened; his jaw protruded; he struggled for speech.\r\n\r\n“The tick! The blister! The blighter! The worm! The pest! The hound! The\r\nbounder!” he cried. “Where is he?”\r\n\r\nHe twisted round in his chair, and having located the companion of his\r\nboyhood, gazed at the back of his ridged and shining head with a\r\nmalevolent scowl. Then, taking up a hard and nobby roll, he poised it\r\nlovingly.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Just this one!”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“Very well.”\r\n\r\nSam threw down the roll with a gesture of resignation. Kay looked at him\r\nin alarm.\r\n\r\n“I had no idea you disliked him so much as that!”\r\n\r\n“He ought to have his neck broken.”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you forgiven him yet for stealing jam sandwiches at school?”\r\n\r\n“It has nothing whatever to do with jam sandwiches. If you really want\r\nto know why I loathe and detest the little beast, it is because he had\r\nthe nerve--the audacity--the insolence--the immortal rind\r\nto--to--er”--he choked--“to kiss you. Blast him!” said Sam, wholly\r\nforgetting the dictates of all good etiquette books respecting the kind\r\nof language suitable in the presence of the other sex.\r\n\r\nKay gasped. It is embarrassing for a girl to find what she had supposed\r\nto be her most intimate private affairs suddenly become, to all\r\nappearance, public property.\r\n\r\n“How do you know that?” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Your uncle told me this morning.”\r\n\r\n“He had no business to.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he did. And what it all boils down to,” said Sam, “is this--will\r\nyou marry me?”\r\n\r\n“Will I--what?”\r\n\r\n“Marry me.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Kay stared speechlessly; then, throwing her head back, she\r\ngave out a short, sharp scream of laughter which made a luncher at the\r\nnext table stab himself in the cheek with an oyster fork. The luncher\r\nlooked at her reproachfully. So did Sam.\r\n\r\n“You seem amused,” he said coldly.\r\n\r\n“Of course I’m amused,” said Kay.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were sparkling, and that little dimple on her chin which had so\r\nexcited Sam’s admiration when seen in photographic reproduction had\r\nbecome a large dimple. Sam tickled her sense of humour. He appealed to\r\nher in precisely the same way as the dog Amy had appealed to her in the\r\ngarden that morning.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why,” said Sam. “There’s nothing funny about it. It’s\r\nmonstrous that you should be going about at the mercy of every bounder\r\nwho takes it into his head to insult you. The idea of a fellow with\r\nmarcelled hair having the crust to----”\r\n\r\nHe paused. He simply could not mention that awful word again.\r\n\r\n“----kiss me?” said Kay. “Well, you did.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Sam with dignity, “was different. That was--er--well, in\r\nshort, different. The fact remains that you need somebody to look after\r\nyou, to protect you.”\r\n\r\n“And you chivalrously offer to do it? I call that awfully nice of you,\r\nbut--well, don’t you think it’s rather absurd?”\r\n\r\n“I see nothing absurd in it at all.”\r\n\r\n“How many times have you seen me in your life?”\r\n\r\n“Thousands!”\r\n\r\n“What? Oh, I was forgetting the photograph. But do photographs really\r\ncount?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Mine can’t have counted much, if the first thing you did was to tell\r\nyour friend Cordelia Blair about it and say she might use it as a\r\nstory.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t. I only said that at dinner to--to introduce the subject. As\r\nif I would have dreamed of talking about you to anybody! And she isn’t a\r\nfriend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“But you kissed her.”\r\n\r\n“I did not kiss her.”\r\n\r\n“My uncle insists that you did. He says he heard horrible sounds of\r\nBohemian revelry going on in the outer office and then you came in and\r\nsaid the lady was soothed.”\r\n\r\n“Your uncle talks too much,” said Sam severely.\r\n\r\n“Just what I was thinking a little while ago. But still, if he tells you\r\nmy secrets, it’s only fair that he should tell me yours.”\r\n\r\nSam swallowed somewhat convulsively.\r\n\r\n“If you really want to know what happened, I’ll tell you. I did not kiss\r\nthat ghastly Blair pipsqueak. She kissed me.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“She kissed me,” repeated Sam doggedly. “I had been laying it on pretty\r\nthick about how much I admired her work, and suddenly she said, ‘Oh, you\r\ndear boy!’ and flung her loathsome arms round my neck. What could I do?\r\nI might have uppercut her as she bored in, but, short of that, there\r\nwasn’t any way of stopping her.”\r\n\r\nA look of shocked sympathy came into Kay’s face.\r\n\r\n“It’s monstrous,” she said, “that you should be going about at the mercy\r\nof every female novelist who takes it into her head to insult you. You\r\nneed somebody to look after you, to protect you----”\r\n\r\nSam’s dignity, never a very durable article, collapsed.\r\n\r\n“You’re quite right,” he said. “Well then----”\r\n\r\nKay shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not going to volunteer. Whatever your friend Cordelia Blair may\r\nsay in her stories, girls don’t marry men they’ve only seen twice in\r\ntheir lives.”\r\n\r\n“This is the fourth time you’ve seen me.”\r\n\r\n“Or even four times.”\r\n\r\n“I knew a man in America who met a girl at a party one night and married\r\nher next morning.”\r\n\r\n“And they were divorced the week after, I should think. No, Mr.\r\nShotter----”\r\n\r\n“You may call me Sam.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I ought to after this. No, Sam, I will not marry you. Thanks\r\never so much for asking me, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know you well enough.”\r\n\r\n“I feel as if I had known you all my life.”\r\n\r\n“Do you?”\r\n\r\n“I feel as if we had been destined for each other from the beginning of\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you were a king in Babylon and I was a Christian slave.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t wonder. And what is more, I’ll tell you something. When I\r\nwas in America, before I had ever dreamed of coming over to England, a\r\npalmist told me that I was shortly about to take a long journey, at the\r\nend of which I should meet a fair girl.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t believe what those palmists say.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but everything else that this one told me was absolutely true.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. She said I had a rare, spiritual nature and a sterling character\r\nand was beloved by all; but that people meeting me for the first time\r\nsometimes failed to appreciate me----”\r\n\r\n“I certainly did.”\r\n\r\n“----because I had such hidden depths.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, was that the reason?”\r\n\r\n“Well, that shows you.”\r\n\r\n“Did she tell you anything else?”\r\n\r\n“Something about bewaring of a dark man, but nothing of importance.\r\nStill, I don’t call it a bad fifty cents’ worth.”\r\n\r\n“Did she say that you were going to marry this girl?”\r\n\r\n“She did--explicitly.”\r\n\r\n“Then the idea, as I understand it, is that you want me to marry you so\r\nthat you won’t feel you wasted your fifty cents. Is that it?”\r\n\r\n“Not precisely. You are overlooking the fact that I love you.” He looked\r\nat her reproachfully. “Don’t laugh.”\r\n\r\n“Was I laughing?”\r\n\r\n“You were.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry. I oughtn’t to mock a strong man’s love, ought I?”\r\n\r\n“You oughtn’t to mock anybody’s love. Love’s a very wonderful thing. It\r\neven made Hash look almost beautiful for a moment, and that’s going\r\nsome.”\r\n\r\n“When is it going to make you look beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“Hasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“You must be patient.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try to be, and in the meantime let us face this situation. Do you\r\nknow what a girl in a Cordelia Blair story would do if she were in my\r\nplace?”\r\n\r\n“Something darned silly, I expect.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. She would do something very pretty and touching. She would\r\nlook at the man and smile tremulously and say, ‘I’m sorry, so--so sorry.\r\nYou have paid me the greatest compliment a man can pay a woman. But it\r\ncannot be. So shall we be pals--just real pals?’”\r\n\r\n“And he would redden and go to Africa, I suppose.\r\n\r\n“No. I should think he would just hang about and hope that some day she\r\nmight change her mind. Girls often do, you know.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled and put out her hand. Sam, with a cold glance at the head\r\nwaiter, whom he considered to be standing much too near and looking much\r\ntoo paternal, took it. He did more--he squeezed it. And an elderly\r\ngentleman of Napoleonic presence, who had been lunching with a cabinet\r\nminister in the main dining-room and was now walking through the court\r\non his way back to his office, saw the proceedings through the large\r\nwindow and halted, spellbound.\r\n\r\nFor a long instant he stood there, gaping. He saw Kay smile. He saw Sam\r\ntake her hand. He saw Sam smile. He saw Sam hold her hand. And then it\r\nseemed to him that he had seen enough. Abandoning his intention of\r\nwalking down Fleet Street, he hailed a cab.\r\n\r\n“There’s Lord Tilbury,” said Kay, looking out.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Sam. He was not interested in Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\n“Going back to work, I suppose. Isn’t it about time you were?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is. You wouldn’t care to come along and have a chat with\r\nyour uncle?”\r\n\r\n“I may look in later. Just now I want to go to that messenger-boy office\r\nin Northumberland Avenue and send off a note.”\r\n\r\n“Important?”\r\n\r\n“It is, rather,” said Kay. “Willoughby Braddock wanted me to do\r\nsomething, and now I find that I shan’t be able to.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\r\n\r\nLORD TILBURY ENGAGES AN ALLY\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nAlthough Lord Tilbury had not seen much of what had passed between Kay\r\nand Sam at the luncheon table, he had seen quite enough; and as he drove\r\nback to Tilbury House in his cab he was thinking hard and bitter\r\nthoughts of the duplicity of the modern girl. Here, he reflected, was\r\none who, encountered at dinner on a given night, had as good as stated\r\nin set terms that she thoroughly disliked Sam Shotter. And on the very\r\nnext afternoon, there she was, lunching with this same Sam Shotter,\r\nsmiling at this same Sam Shotter and allowing this same Shotter to press\r\nher hand. It all looked very black to Lord Tilbury, and the only\r\nsolution that presented itself to him was that the girl’s apparent\r\ndislike of Sam on the previous night had been caused by a lovers’\r\nquarrel. He knew all about lovers’ quarrels, for his papers were full of\r\nstories, both short and in serial form, that dealt with nothing else.\r\nOh, woman, woman! about summed up Lord Tilbury’s view of the affair.\r\n\r\nHe was, he perceived, in an extraordinarily difficult position. As he\r\nhad explained to his sister Frances on the occasion of Sam’s first visit\r\nto the Mammoth Publishing Company, a certain tactfulness and diplomacy\r\nin the handling of that disturbing young man were essential. He had not\r\nbeen able, during his visit to America, to ascertain exactly how Sam\r\nstood in the estimation of his uncle. The impression Lord Tilbury had\r\ngot was that Mr. Pynsent was fond of him. If, therefore, any\r\nunpleasantness should occur which might lead to a breach between Sam and\r\nthe Mammoth Publishing Company, Mr. Pynsent might be expected to take\r\nhis nephew’s side, and this would be disastrous. Any steps, accordingly,\r\nwhich were to be taken in connection with foiling the young man’s love\r\naffair must be taken subtly and with stealth.\r\n\r\nThat such steps were necessary it never occurred to Lord Tilbury for an\r\ninstant to doubt. His only standard when it came to judging his fellow\r\ncreatures was the money standard, and it would have seemed ridiculous to\r\nhim to suppose that any charm or moral worth that Kay might possess\r\ncould neutralise the fact that she had not a penny in the world. He took\r\nit for granted that Mr. Pynsent would see eye to eye with him in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the helplessness of his position tormented him.\r\nHe paced the room in an agony of spirit. The very first move in his\r\ncampaign must obviously be to keep a watchful eye on Sam and note what\r\nprogress this deplorable affair of his was having. But Sam was in Valley\r\nFields and he was in London. What he required, felt Lord Tilbury, as he\r\nploughed to and fro over the carpet, his thumbs tucked into the armholes\r\nof his waistcoat, his habit when in thought, was an ally. But what ally?\r\n\r\nA secret-service man. But what secret-service man? A properly\r\naccredited spy, who, introduced by some means into the young man’s\r\nhouse, could look, listen and make daily reports on his behaviour.\r\n\r\nBut what spy?\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, as he continued to perambulate, inspiration came to\r\nLord Tilbury. It seemed to him that the job in hand might have been\r\ncreated to order for young Pilbeam.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous publications which had their being in Tilbury House\r\nwas that popular weekly, _Society Spice_, a paper devoted to the\r\nexploitation of the shadier side of London life and edited by one whom\r\nthe proprietor of the Mammoth had long looked on as the brightest and\r\nmost promising of his young men--Percy Pilbeam, to wit, as enterprising\r\na human ferret as ever wrote a Things-We-Want-to-Know-Don’t-You-Know\r\nparagraph. Young Pilbeam would handle this business as it should be\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\nIt was the sort of commission which he had undertaken before and carried\r\nthrough with complete success, reflected Lord Tilbury, recalling how\r\nonly a few months back Percy Pilbeam, in order to obtain material for\r\nhis paper, had gone for three weeks as valet to one of the smart\r\nset--the happy conclusion of the venture being that admirable\r\nCountry-House Cesspools series which had done so much for the rural\r\ncirculation of _Society Spice_.\r\n\r\nHis hand was on the buzzer to summon this eager young spirit, when a\r\ndisturbing thought occurred to him, and instead of sending for Pilbeam,\r\nhe sent for Sam Shotter.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Shotter, I--ah---- Do you happen to know young Pilbeam?” said His\r\nLordship.\r\n\r\n“The editor of _Society Spice_?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“I know him by sight.”\r\n\r\n“You know him by sight, eh? Ah? You know him, eh? Exactly. Quite so. I\r\nwas only wondering. A charming young fellow. You should cultivate his\r\nacquaintance. That is all, Shotter.”\r\n\r\nSam, with a passing suspicion that the strain of conducting a great\r\nbusiness had been too much for his employer, returned to his work; and\r\nLord Tilbury, walking with bent brows to the window, stood looking out,\r\nonce more deep in thought.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Sam was acquainted with Pilbeam was just one of those\r\nlittle accidents which so often upset the brilliantly conceived plans of\r\ngreat generals, and it left His Lordship at something of a loss. Pilbeam\r\nwas a man he could have trusted in a delicate affair like this, and now\r\nthat he was ruled out, where else was an adequate agent to be found?\r\n\r\nIt was at this point in his meditations that his eyes, roving\r\nrestlessly, were suddenly attracted by a sign on a window immediately\r\nopposite:\r\n\r\n                  THE TILBURY DETECTIVE AGENCY, LTD.\r\n                       J. Sheringham Adair, Mgr.\r\n                       Large and Efficient Staff\r\n\r\nSuch was the sign, and Lord Tilbury read and re-read it with bulging\r\neyes. It thrilled him like a direct answer to prayer.\r\n\r\nA moment later he had seized his hat, and without pausing to wait for\r\nthe lift, was leaping down the stairs like some chamois of the Alps that\r\nbounds from crag to crag. He reached the lobby and, at a rate of speed\r\nalmost dangerous in a man of his build and sedentary habits, whizzed\r\nacross the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nAlthough, with the single exception of a woman who had lost her\r\nPekingese dog, there had never yet been a client on the premises of the\r\nTilbury Detective Agency, it was Chimp Twist’s practice to repair daily\r\nto his office and remain there for an hour or two every afternoon. If\r\nquestioned, he would have replied that he might just as well be there as\r\nanywhere; and he felt, moreover, that it looked well for him to be seen\r\ngoing in and out--a theory which was supported by the fact that only a\r\ncouple of days back the policeman on the beat had touched his helmet to\r\nhim. To have policemen touching themselves on the helmet instead of him\r\non the shoulder was a novel and agreeable experience to Chimp.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon he was sitting, as usual, with the solitaire pack laid\r\nout on the table before him, but his mind was not on the game. He was\r\nmusing on Soapy Molloy’s story of his failure to persuade Sam to\r\nevacuate Mon Repos.\r\n\r\nTo an extent, this failure had complicated matters; and yet there was a\r\nbright side. To have walked in and collected the late Edward Finglass’\r\nlegacy without let or hindrance would have been agreeable; but, on the\r\nother hand, it would have involved sharing with Soapy and his bride;\r\nand Chimp was by nature one of those men who, when there is money about,\r\ninstinctively dislike seeing even a portion of it get away from them. It\r\nseemed to him that a man of his admitted ingenuity might very well\r\nevolve some scheme by which the Molloy family could be successfully\r\nexcluded from all participation in the treasure.\r\n\r\nIt only required a little thought, felt Chimp; and he was still thinking\r\nwhen a confused noise without announced the arrival of Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the door was followed by a silence. Lord Tilbury was not\r\nbuilt for speed, and the rapidity with which he had crossed the street\r\nand mounted four flights of stairs had left him in a condition where he\r\nwas able only to sink into a chair and pant like a spent seal. As for\r\nChimp, he was too deeply moved to speak. Even when lying back in a chair\r\nand saying “Woof!” Lord Tilbury still retained the unmistakable look of\r\none to whom bank managers grovel, and the sudden apparition of such a\r\nman affected him like a miracle. He felt as if he had been fishing idly\r\nfor minnows and landed a tarpon.\r\n\r\nBeing, however, a man of resource, he soon recovered himself. Placing a\r\nfoot on a button beneath the table, he caused a sharp ringing to pervade\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” he said, politely but with a busy man’s curtness, as he\r\ntook up the telephone. “Yes? Yes? Yes, this is the Tilbury Detective\r\nAgency.... Scotland Yard? Right, I’ll hold the wire.”\r\n\r\nHe placed a hand over the transmitter and turned to Lord Tilbury with a\r\nlittle rueful grimace.\r\n\r\n“Always bothering me,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Woof!” said Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\nMr. Twist renewed his attention to the telephone.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!... Sir John? Good afternoon.... Yes.... Yes.... We are doing our\r\nbest, Sir John. We are always anxious to oblige headquarters.... Yes....\r\nYes.... Very well, Sir John. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nHe replaced the receiver and was at Lord Tilbury’s disposal.\r\n\r\n“If the Yard would get rid of their antiquated system and give more\r\nscope to men of brains,” he said, not bitterly but with a touch of\r\nannoyance, “they would not always have to be appealing to us to help\r\nthem out. Did you know that a man cannot be a detective at Scotland Yard\r\nunless he is over a certain height?”\r\n\r\n“You surprise me,” said Lord Tilbury, who was now feeling better.\r\n\r\n“Five-foot-nine, I believe it is. Could there be an absurder\r\nregulation?”\r\n\r\n“It sounds ridiculous.”\r\n\r\n“And is,” said Chimp severely. “I am five-foot-seven myself. Wilbraham\r\nand Donahue, the best men on my staff, are an inch and half an inch\r\nshorter. You cannot gauge brains by height.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” said Lord Tilbury, who was five-feet-six. “Look at\r\nNapoleon! And Nelson!”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Chimp. “Battling Nelson. A very good case in point. And\r\nTom Sharkey was a short man too.... Well, what was it you wished to\r\nconsult me about, Mr.---- I have not your name.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury hesitated.\r\n\r\n“I take it that I may rely on your complete discretion, Mr. Adair?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing that you tell me in this room will go any farther,” said Chimp,\r\nwith dignity.\r\n\r\n“I am Lord Tilbury,” said His Lordship, looking like a man unveiling a\r\nstatue of himself.\r\n\r\n“The proprietor of the joint across the way?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Lord Tilbury a little shortly.\r\n\r\nHe had expected his name to cause more emotion, and he did not like\r\nhearing the Mammoth Publishing Company described as “the joint across\r\nthe way.”\r\n\r\nHe would have been gratified had he known that his companion had\r\nexperienced considerable emotion and that it was only by a strong effort\r\nthat he had contrived to conceal it. He might have been less pleased if\r\nhe had been aware that Chimp was confidently expecting him to reveal\r\nsome disgraceful secret which would act as the foundation for future\r\nblackmail. For although, in establishing his detective agency, Chimp\r\nTwist had been animated chiefly by the desire to conceal his more\r\nimportant movements, he had never lost sight of the fact that there are\r\npossibilities in such an institution.\r\n\r\n“And what can I do for you, Lord Tilbury?” he asked, putting his finger\r\ntips together.\r\n\r\nHis Lordship bent closer.\r\n\r\n“I want a man watched.”\r\n\r\nOnce again his companion was barely able to conceal his elation. This\r\nsounded exceptionally promising. Though only an imitation private\r\ndetective, Chimp Twist had a genuine private detective’s soul. He could\r\nimagine but one reason why men should want men watched.\r\n\r\n“A boy on the staff of Tilbury House.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Chimp, more convinced than ever. “Good-looking fellow, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury considered. He had never had occasion to form an opinion of\r\nSam’s looks.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said.\r\n\r\n“One of these lounge lizards, eh? One of these parlour tarantulas? I\r\nknow the sort--know ’em well. One of these slithery young-feller-me-lads\r\nwith educated feet and shiny hair. And when did the dirty work start?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“When did you first suspect this young man of alienating Lady Tilbury’s\r\naffections?”\r\n\r\n“Lady Tilbury? I don’t understand you. I am a widower.”\r\n\r\n“Eh? Then what’s this fellow done?” said Chimp, feeling at sea again.\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury coughed.\r\n\r\n“I had better tell you the whole position. This boy is the nephew of a\r\nbusiness acquaintance of mine in America, with whom I am in the process\r\nof conducting some very delicate negotiations. He, the boy, is over here\r\nat the moment, working on my staff, and I am, you will understand,\r\npractically responsible to his uncle for his behaviour. That is to say,\r\nshould he do anything of which his uncle might disapprove, the blame\r\nwill fall on me, and these negotiations--these very delicate\r\nnegotiations--will undoubtedly be broken off. My American acquaintance\r\nis a peculiar man, you understand.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I have just discovered that the boy is conducting a clandestine\r\nlove affair with a girl of humble circumstances who resides in the\r\nsuburb.”\r\n\r\n“A tooting tooti-frooti,” translated Chimp, nodding. “I see.”\r\n\r\n“A what?” asked Lord Tilbury, a little blankly.\r\n\r\n“A belle of Balham--Bertha from Brixton.”\r\n\r\n“She lives at Valley Fields. And this boy Shotter has taken the house\r\nnext door to her. I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said Chimp in a thick voice.\r\n\r\n“I thought you spoke.”\r\n\r\n“No.” Chimp swallowed feverishly. “Did you say Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“Shotter.”\r\n\r\n“Taken a house in Valley Fields?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. In Burberry Road. Mon Repos is the name.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Chimp, expelling a deep breath.\r\n\r\n“You see the position? All that can be done at present is to institute a\r\nclose watch on the boy. It may be that I have allowed myself to become\r\nunduly alarmed. Possibly he does not contemplate so serious a step as\r\nmarriage with this young woman. Nevertheless, I should be decidedly\r\nrelieved if I felt that there was someone in his house watching his\r\nmovements and making daily reports to me.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take this case,” said Chimp.\r\n\r\n“Good! You will put a competent man on it?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t trust it to one of my staff, not even Wilbraham or Donahue.\r\nI’ll take it on myself.”\r\n\r\n“That is very good of you, Mr. Adair.”\r\n\r\n“A pleasure,” said Chimp.\r\n\r\n“And now arises a difficult point. How do you propose to make your entry\r\ninto young Shotter’s household?”\r\n\r\n“Easy as pie. Odd-job man.”\r\n\r\n“Odd-job man?”\r\n\r\n“They always want odd-job men down in the suburbs. Fellows who’ll do the\r\ndirty work that the help kick at. Listen here, you tell this young man\r\nthat I’m a fellow that once worked for you and ask him to engage me as a\r\npersonal favour. That’ll cinch it. He won’t like to refuse the\r\nboss--what I mean.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Lord Tilbury. “True. But it will necessitate something in\r\nthe nature of a change of costumes,” he went on, looking at the other’s\r\nshining tweeds.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you fret. I’ll dress the part.”\r\n\r\n“And what name would you suggest taking? Not your own, of course?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve always called myself Twist before.”\r\n\r\n“Twist? Excellent! Then suppose you come to my office in half an hour’s\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Sure!”\r\n\r\n“I am much obliged, Mr. Adair.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Chimp handsomely. “Not a-tall! Don’t mention it. Only\r\ntoo pleased.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nSam, when the summons came for him to go to his employer’s office, was\r\nreading with no small complacency a little thing of his own in the issue\r\nof Pyke’s _Home Companion_ which would be on the bookstalls next\r\nmorning. It was signed Aunt Ysobel, and it gave some most admirable\r\ncounsel to Worried (Upper Sydenham) who had noticed of late a growing\r\ncoldness toward her on the part of her betrothed.\r\n\r\nHe had just finished reading this, marvelling, as authors will when they\r\nsee their work in print, at the purity of his style and the soundness of\r\nhis reasoning, when the telephone rang and he learned that Lord Tilbury\r\ndesired his presence. He hastened to the holy of holies and found there\r\nnot only His Lordship but a little man with a waxed moustache, to which\r\nhe took an instant dislike.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Shotter,” said Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Lord Tilbury, one hand resting on the back of his\r\nchair, the fingers of the other in the fold of his waistcoat, stood\r\nlooking like a Victorian uncle being photographed. The little man\r\nfingered the waxed moustache. And Sam glanced from Lord Tilbury to the\r\nmoustache inquiringly and with distaste. He had never seen a moustache\r\nhe disliked more.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Shotter,” said Lord Tilbury, “this is a man named Twist, who was at\r\none time in my employment.”\r\n\r\n“Odd-job man,” interpolated the waxed-moustached one.\r\n\r\n“As odd-job man,” said Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\n“Ah?” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“He is now out of work.”\r\n\r\nSam, looking at Mr. Twist, considered that this spoke well for the\r\nrugged good sense of the employers of London.\r\n\r\n“I have nothing to offer him myself,” continued Lord Tilbury, “so it\r\noccurred to me that you might possibly have room for him in your new\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“Me?” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“I should take it as a personal favour to myself if you would engage\r\nTwist. I naturally dislike the idea of an old and--er--faithful employee\r\nof mine being out of work.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twist’s foresight was justified. Put in this way, the request was\r\none that Sam found it difficult to refuse.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, in that case----”\r\n\r\n“Excellent! No doubt you will find plenty of little things for him to do\r\nabout your house and garden.”\r\n\r\n“He can wash the dog,” said Sam, inspired. The question of the bathing\r\nof Amy was rapidly thrusting itself into the forefront of the domestic\r\npolitics of Mon Repos.\r\n\r\n“Exactly! And chop wood and run errands and what not.”\r\n\r\n“There’s just one thing,” said Sam, who had been eying his new assistant\r\nwith growing aversion. “That moustache must come off.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Chimp, stricken to the core.\r\n\r\n“Right off at the roots,” said Sam sternly. “I will not have a thing\r\nlike that about the place, attracting the moths.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury sighed. He found this young man’s eccentricities\r\nincreasingly hard to bear. With that sad wistfulness which the Greeks\r\ncalled _pathos_ and the Romans _desiderium_, he thought of the happy\r\ndays, only a few weeks back, when he had been a peaceful, care-free man,\r\nignorant of Sam’s very existence. He had had his troubles then, no\r\ndoubt; but how small and trivial they seemed now.\r\n\r\n“I suppose Twist will shave off his moustache if you wish it,” he said\r\nwearily.\r\n\r\nChancing to catch that eminent private investigator’s eye, he was\r\nsurprised to note its glazed and despairing expression. The man had the\r\nair of one who has received a death sentence.\r\n\r\n“Shave it?” quavered Chimp, fondling the growth tenderly. “Shave my\r\nmoustache?”\r\n\r\n“Shave it,” said Sam firmly. “Hew it down. Raze it to the soil and sow\r\nsalt upon the foundations.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” said Chimp lugubriously.\r\n\r\n“That is settled then,” said Lord Tilbury, relieved. “So you will enter\r\nMr. Shotter’s employment immediately, Twist.”\r\n\r\nChimp nodded a mournful nod.\r\n\r\n“You will find Twist thoroughly satisfactory, I am sure. He is quiet,\r\nsober, respectful and hard-working.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that’s bad,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury heaved another sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY\r\n\r\nTROUBLE IN THE SYNDICATE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Chimp Twist left Tilbury House, he turned westward along the\r\nEmbankment, for he had an appointment to meet his colleagues of the\r\nsyndicate at the Lyons tea shop in Green Street, Leicester Square. The\r\ndepression which had swept over him on hearing Sam’s dreadful edict had\r\nnot lasted long. Men of Mr. Twist’s mode of life are generally\r\nresilient. They have to be.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he felt, it would be churlish of him, in the face of this\r\nalmost supernatural slice of luck, to grumble at the one crumpled rose\r\nleaf. Besides, it would only take him about a couple of days to get away\r\nwith the treasure of Mon Repos, and then he could go into retirement and\r\ngrow his moustache again. For there is this about moustaches, as about\r\nwhiskers--though of these Mr. Twist, to do him justice, had never been\r\nguilty--that, like truth, though crushed to the earth, they will rise. A\r\nlittle patience and his moustache will rise on stepping-stones of its\r\ndead self to higher things. Yes, when the fields were white with daisies\r\nit would return. Pondering thus, Chimp Twist walked briskly to the end\r\nof the Embankment, turned up Northumberland Avenue, and reaching his\r\ndestination, found Mr. and Mrs. Molloy waiting for him at a table in a\r\nfar corner.\r\n\r\nIt was quiet in the tea shop at this hour, and the tryst had been\r\narranged with that fact in mind. For this was in all essentials a board\r\nmeeting of the syndicate, and business men and women do not like to have\r\ntheir talk interrupted by noisy strangers clamorous for food. With the\r\nexception of a woman in a black silk dress with bugles who, incredible\r\nas it may seem, had ordered cocoa and sparkling limado simultaneously\r\nand was washing down a meal of Cambridge sausages and pastry with\r\nalternate draughts of both liquids, the place was empty.\r\n\r\nSoapy and his bride, Chimp perceived, were looking grave, even gloomy;\r\nand in the process of crossing the room he forced his own face into an\r\nexpression in sympathy with theirs. It would not do, he realised, to\r\nallow his joyous excitement to become manifest at what was practically a\r\npost-mortem. For the meeting had been convened to sit upon the failure\r\nof his recent scheme and he suspected the possibility of a vote of\r\ncensure. He therefore sat down with a heavy seriousness befitting the\r\noccasion; and having ordered a cup of coffee, replied to his companions’\r\nquestioning glances with a sorrowful shake of the head.\r\n\r\n“Nothing stirring,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t doped out another scheme,” said Dolly, bending her shapely\r\nbrows in a frown.\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” demanded the lady heatedly, “where does this\r\nsixty-five-thirty-five stuff come in? That’s what I’d like to know.”\r\n\r\n“Me, too,” said Mr. Molloy with spirit. It occurred to Chimp that a\r\nlittle informal discussion must have been indulged in by his colleagues\r\nof the board previous to his arrival, for their unanimity was wonderful.\r\n\r\n“You threw a lot of bull about being the brains of the concern,” said\r\nDolly accusingly, “and said that, being the brains of the concern, you\r\nhad ought to be paid highest. And now you blow in and admit that you\r\nhaven’t any more ideas than a rabbit.”\r\n\r\n“Not so many,” said Mr. Molloy, who liked rabbits and had kept them as a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nChimp stirred his coffee thoughtfully. He was meditating on what a\r\ndifference a very brief time can make in the fortunes of man. But for\r\nthat amazing incursion of Lord Tilbury, he would have been approaching\r\nthis interview in an extremely less happy frame of mind. For it was\r\nplain that the temper of the shareholders was stormy.\r\n\r\n“You’re quite right, Dolly,” he said humbly, “quite right. I’m not so\r\ngood as I thought I was.”\r\n\r\nThis handsome admission should have had the effect proverbially\r\nattributed to soft words, but it served only to fan the flame.\r\n\r\n“Then where do you get off with this sixty-five-thirty-five?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” said Chimp. “I don’t, Dolly.” The man’s humility was\r\ntouching. “That’s all cold. We split fifty-fifty, that’s what we do.”\r\n\r\nSoft words may fail, but figures never. Dolly uttered a cry that caused\r\nthe woman in the bugles to spill her cocoa, and Mr. Molloy shook as with\r\na palsy.\r\n\r\n“Now you’re talking,” said Dolly.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Mr. Molloy, “you are talking.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s that,” said Chimp. “Now let’s get down to it and see what\r\nwe can do.”\r\n\r\n“I might go to the joint again and have another talk with that guy,”\r\nsuggested Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\n“No sense in that,” said Chimp, somewhat perturbed. It did not at all\r\nsuit his plans to have his old friend roaming about in the neighbourhood\r\nof Mon Repos while he was in residence.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know so much,” said Mr. Molloy thoughtfully. “I didn’t seem to\r\nget going quite good that last time. The fellow had me out on the\r\nsidewalk before I could pull a real spiel. If I tried again----”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be any use,” said Chimp. “This guy Shotter told you himself\r\nhe had a special reason for staying on.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t think he’s wise to the stuff being there?” said Dolly,\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Chimp. “Nothing like that. There’s a dame next door he’s\r\nkind of stuck on.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\nChimp gulped. He felt like a man who discovers himself on the brink of a\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\n“I--I was snooping around down there and I saw ’em,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What were you doing down there?” asked Dolly suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“Just looking around, Dolly, just looking around.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?”\r\n\r\nThe silence which followed was so embarrassing to a sensitive man that\r\nChimp swallowed his coffee hastily and rose.\r\n\r\n“Going?” said Mr. Molloy coldly.\r\n\r\n“Just remembered I’ve got a date.”\r\n\r\n“When do we meet again?”\r\n\r\n“No sense in meeting for the next day or two.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Well, a fellow wants time to think. I’ll give you a ring.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be at your office to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“Not to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Day after?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe not the day after. I’m moving around some.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, all around.”\r\n\r\n“Doing what?”\r\n\r\nChimp’s self-control gave way.\r\n\r\n“Say, what’s eating you?” he demanded. “Where do you get this stuff of\r\nprying and poking into a man’s affairs? Can’t a fellow have a little\r\nprivacy sometimes?”\r\n\r\n“Sure!” said Mr. Molloy. “Sure!”\r\n\r\n“Sure!” said Mrs. Molloy. “Sure!”\r\n\r\n“Well, good-bye,” said Chimp.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\n“God bless you,” said Mrs. Molloy, with a little click of her teeth.\r\n\r\nChimp left the tea shop. It was not a dignified exit, and he was aware\r\nof it with every step that he took. He was also aware of the eyes of his\r\ntwo colleagues boring into his retreating back. Still, what did it\r\nmatter, argued Chimp Twist, even if that stiff, Soapy, and his wife had\r\nsuspicions of him? They could not know. And all he needed was a clear\r\nday or two and they could suspect all they pleased. Nevertheless, he\r\nregretted that unfortunate slip.\r\n\r\nThe door had hardly closed behind him when Dolly put her suspicions into\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“Soapy!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, petty?”\r\n\r\n“That bird is aiming to double-cross us.”\r\n\r\n“You said it!”\r\n\r\n“I wondered why he switched to that fifty-fifty proposition so smooth.\r\nAnd when he let it out that he’d been snooping around down there, I\r\nknew. He’s got some little game of his own on, that’s what he’s got.\r\nHe’s planning to try and scoop that stuff by himself and leave us flat.”\r\n\r\n“The low hound!” said Mr. Molloy virtuously.\r\n\r\n“We got to get action, Soapy, or we’ll be left. To think of that little\r\nChimp doing us dirt just goes against my better nature. How would it be\r\nif you was to go down to-night and do some more porch climbing? Once you\r\nwere in, you could get the stuff easily. It wouldn’t be a case of\r\nhunting around same as last time.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sweetie,” said Mr. Molloy frankly, “I’ll tell you. I’m not so\r\nstrong for that burgling stuff. It’s not my line and I don’t like it.\r\nIt’s awful dark and lonesome in that joint at three o’clock in the\r\nmorning. All the time I was there I kep’ looking over my shoulder,\r\nexpecting old Finky’s ghost to sneak up on me and breathe down the back\r\nof my neck.”\r\n\r\n“Be a man, honey!”\r\n\r\n“I’m a man all right, petty, but I’m temperamental.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then----” said Dolly, and breaking off abruptly, plunged into\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy watched her fondly and hopefully. He had a great respect for\r\nher woman’s resourcefulness, and it seemed to him from the occasional\r\ngleam in her vivid eyes that something was doing.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got it!”\r\n\r\n“You have?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir!”\r\n\r\n“There is none like her, none,” Mr. Molloy’s glistening eye seemed to\r\nsay. “Give us an earful, baby,” he begged emotionally.\r\n\r\nDolly bent closer and lowered her voice to a whisper. The woman in the\r\nbugles, torpid with much limado, was out of ear-shot, but a waitress was\r\nhovering not far away.\r\n\r\n“Listen! We got to wait till the guy Shotter is out of the house.”\r\n\r\n“But he’s got a man. You told me that yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Sure he’s got a man, but if you’ll only listen I’ll tell you. We wait\r\ntill this fellow Shotter is out----”\r\n\r\n“How do we know he’s out?”\r\n\r\n“We ask at the front door, of course. Say, listen, Soapy, for the love\r\nof Pete don’t keep interrupting! We go to the house. You go round to the\r\nback door.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll soak you one in a minute,” exclaimed Dolly despairingly.\r\n\r\n“All right, sweetness. Sorry. Didn’t mean to butt in. Keep talking. You\r\nhave the floor.”\r\n\r\n“You go round to the back door and wait, keeping your eye on the front\r\nsteps, where I’ll be. I ring the bell and the hired man comes. I say,\r\n‘Is Mr. Shotter at home?’ If he says yes, I’ll go in and make some sort\r\nof spiel about something. But if he’s not, I’ll give you the high sign\r\nand you slip in at the back door; and then when the man comes down into\r\nthe kitchen again you’re waiting and you bean him one with a sandbag.\r\nThen you tie him up and come along to the front door and let me in and\r\nwe go up and grab that stuff. How about it?”\r\n\r\n“I bean him one?” said Mr. Molloy doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Cert’nly you bean him one.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t do it, petty,” said Mr. Molloy. “I’ve never beaned anyone in\r\nmy life.”\r\n\r\nDolly exhibited the impatience which all wives, from Lady Macbeth\r\ndownward through the ages, have felt when their schemes appear in danger\r\nof being thwarted by the pusillanimity of a husband.\r\n\r\nThe words, “Infirm of purpose, give me the sandbag!” seemed to be\r\ntrembling on her lips.\r\n\r\n“You poor cake eater!” she cried with justifiable vigour. “You talk as\r\nif it needed a college education to lean a stuffed eelskin on a guy’s\r\nhead. Of course you can do it. You’re behind the kitchen door, see?--and\r\nhe comes in, see?--and you sim’ly bust him one, see? A feller with one\r\narm and no legs could do it. And, say, if you want something to brace\r\nyou up, think of all that money lying in the cistern, just waiting for\r\nus to come and dip for it!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Mr. Molloy, brightening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\r\n\r\nAUNT YSOBEL POINTS THE WAY\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nClaire Lippett sat in the kitchen of San Rafael, reading Pyke’s _Home\r\nCompanion_. It was Mr. Wrenn’s kindly custom to bring back a copy for\r\nher each week on the day of publication, thus saving her an outlay of\r\ntwopence. She was alone in the house, for Kay was up in London doing\r\nsome shopping, and Mr. Wrenn, having come in and handed over the current\r\nnumber, had gone off for a game of chess with his friend, Cornelius.\r\n\r\nShe was not expecting to be alone long. Muffins lay on the table, all\r\nready to be toasted; a cake which she had made herself stood beside\r\nthem; and there was also a new tin of anchovy paste--all of which\r\ndainties were designed for the delectation of Hash Todhunter, her\r\nfiancé, who would shortly be coming to tea.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, Pyke’s _Home Companion_ absorbed Claire’s undivided\r\nattention, for she was one of its most devoted supporters; but this\r\nevening she found her mind wandering, for there was that upon it which\r\nnot even Cordelia Blair’s _Hearts Aflame_ could conjure away.\r\n\r\nClaire was worried. On the previous day a cloud had fallen on her life,\r\nnot exactly blotting out the sunshine, but seeming to threaten some such\r\neclipse in the near future. She had taken Hash to John Street for a\r\nformal presentation to her mother, and it was on the way home that she\r\nhad first observed the approach of the cloud.\r\n\r\nHash’s manner had seemed to her peculiar. A girl who has just become\r\nromantically betrothed to a man does not expect that man, when they are\r\nsitting close together on the top of an omnibus, to talk moodily of the\r\nunwisdom of hasty marriages.\r\n\r\nIt pains and surprises her when he mentions friends of his who, plunging\r\nhot-heatedly into matrimony, spent years of subsequent regret. And when,\r\nstaring woodenly before him, he bids her look at Samson, Doctor Crippen\r\nand other celebrities who were not fortunate in their domestic lives,\r\nshe feels a certain alarm.\r\n\r\nAnd such had been the trend of Hash Todhunter’s conversation, coming\r\nhome from John Street. Claire, recalling the more outstanding of his\r\ndicta, felt puzzled and unhappy, and not even the fact that Cordelia\r\nBlair had got her hero into a ruined mill with villains lurking on the\r\nground floor and dynamite stored in the basement could enchain her\r\ninterest. She turned the page listlessly and found herself confronted by\r\nAunt Ysobel’s Chats With My Girls.\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, Claire’s spirits rose a little. She never failed to\r\nread every word that Aunt Ysobel wrote, for she considered that lady a\r\ncomplete guide to all mundane difficulties. Nor was this an unduly\r\nflattering opinion, for Aunt Ysobel was indeed like a wise pilot,\r\ngently steering the storm-tossed barks of her fellow men and women\r\nthrough the shoals and sunken rocks of the ocean of life. If you wanted\r\nto know whether to blow on your tea or allow it to cool of itself in\r\nGod’s good time, Aunt Ysobel would tell you. If, approaching her on a\r\ndeeper subject, you desired to ascertain the true significance of the\r\ndark young man’s offer of flowers, she could tell you that too--even\r\nattributing to each individual bloom a hidden and esoteric meaning which\r\nit would have been astonished to find that it possessed.\r\n\r\nShould a lady shake hands or bow on parting with a gentleman whom she\r\nhas met only once? Could a gentleman present a lady with a pound of\r\nchocolates without committing himself to anything unduly definite? Must\r\nmother always come along? Did you say “Miss Jones--Mr. Smith” or “Mr.\r\nSmith--Miss Jones,” when introducing friends? And arising from this\r\nquestion, did Mr. Smith on such an occasion say, “Pleased to meet you”\r\nor “Happy, I’m sure”?\r\n\r\nAunt Ysobel was right there every time with the correct answer. And\r\neverything she wrote had a universal message.\r\n\r\nIt was so to-day. Scarcely had Claire begun to read, when her eye was\r\ncaught by a paragraph headed Worried (Upper Sydenham).\r\n\r\n“Coo!” said Claire.\r\n\r\nThe passage ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     “WORRIED (Upper Sydenham). You tell me, dear, that the man to whom\r\n     you are betrothed seems to you to be growing cold, and you ask me\r\n     what you had better do. Well, dear, there is only one thing you\r\n     can do, and I give this advice to all my girl friends who come to\r\n     me with this trouble. You must test this man. You see, he may not\r\n     really be growing cold; he may merely have some private business\r\n     worry on his mind which causes him to seem distrait. If you test\r\n     him you will soon learn the truth. What I suggest may seem to you\r\n     at first a wee bit unladylike, but try it all the same. Pretend to\r\n     show a liking for some other gentleman friend of yours. Even flirt\r\n     with him a teeny-weeny bit.\r\n\r\n     “You will soon discover then if this young man really cares for you\r\n     still. If he does he will exhibit agitation. He may even go to the\r\n     length of becoming violent. In the olden days, you know, knights\r\n     used to joust for the love of their lady. Try Herbert or George, or\r\n     whatever his name is, out for a week, and see if you can work him\r\n     up to the jousting stage.”\r\n\r\nClaire laid down the paper with trembling hands. The thing might have\r\nbeen written for her personal benefit. There was no getting away from\r\nAunt Ysobel. She touched the spot every time.\r\n\r\nOf course, there were difficulties. It was all very well for Aunt Ysobel\r\nto recommend flirting with some other male member of your circle, but\r\nsuppose your circle was so restricted that there were no available\r\nvictims. From the standpoint of dashing male society, Burberry Road was\r\nat the moment passing through rather a lean time. The postman was an\r\nelderly man who, if he stopped to exchange a word, talked only of his\r\nson in Canada. The baker’s representative, on the other hand, was a\r\nmere boy, and so was the butcher’s. Besides, she might smile upon these\r\nby the hour and Hash would never see her. It was all very complex, and\r\nshe was still pondering upon the problem when a whistle from without\r\nannounced the arrival of her guest.\r\n\r\nThe chill of yesterday still hung over Mr. Todhunter’s demeanour. He was\r\nnot precisely cold, but he was most certainly not warm. He managed\r\nsomehow to achieve a kind of intermediate temperature. He was rather\r\nlike a broiled fish that has been lying too long on a plate.\r\n\r\nHe kissed Claire. That is to say, technically the thing was a kiss. But\r\nit was not the kiss of other days.\r\n\r\n“What’s up?” asked Claire, hurt.\r\n\r\n“Nothing’s up.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is something up.”\r\n\r\n“No, there ain’t anything up.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is.”\r\n\r\n“No, there ain’t.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Claire, “what’s up?”\r\n\r\nThese intellectual exchanges seemed to have the effect of cementing Mr.\r\nTodhunter’s gloom. He relapsed into a dark silence, and Claire, her chin\r\ndangerously elevated, prepared tea.\r\n\r\nTea did not thaw the guest. He ate a muffin, sampled the cake and drank\r\ndeeply; but he still remained that strange, moody figure who rather\r\nreminded Claire of the old earl in _Hearts Aflame_. But then the old\r\nearl had had good reason for looking like a man who has drained the wine\r\nof life and is now unwillingly facing the lees, because he had driven\r\nhis only daughter from his door, and though mistaken in this view,\r\nsupposed that she had died of consumption in Australia. (It was really\r\nanother girl.) But why Hash should look like one who has drained the\r\nfour ale of life and found a dead mouse at the bottom of the pewter,\r\nClaire did not know, and she quivered with a sense of injury.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was a hostess. (“A hostess, dears, must never, never permit\r\nher private feelings to get the better of her”--Aunt Ysobel.)\r\n\r\n“Would you like a nice fresh lettuce?” she asked. It might be, she felt,\r\nthat this would just make the difference.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Hash. He had a weakness for lettuces.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go down the garden and cut you one.”\r\n\r\nHe did not offer to accompany her, and that in itself was significant.\r\nIt was with a heart bowed down that Claire took her knife and made her\r\nway along the gravel path. So preoccupied was she that she did not cast\r\neven a glance over the fence till she was aware suddenly of a strange\r\nmoaning sound proceeding from the domain of Mon Repos. This excited her\r\ncuriosity. She stopped, listened, and finally looked.\r\n\r\nThe garden of Mon Repos presented an animated spectacle. Sam was\r\nwatering a flower bed, and not far away the dog Amy, knee-deep in a tub,\r\nwas being bathed by a small, clean-shaven man who was a stranger to\r\nClaire.\r\n\r\nBoth of them seemed to be having a rough passage. Amy, as is the habit\r\nof her species on these occasions, was conveying the impression of being\r\nat death’s door and far from resigned. Her mournful eyes stared\r\nhopelessly at the sky, her brow was wrinkled with a perplexed sorrow,\r\nand at intervals she uttered a stricken wail. On these occasions she in\r\naddition shook herself petulantly, and Chimp Twist--for, as Miss Blair\r\nwould have said, it was he--was always well within range.\r\n\r\nClaire stopped, transfixed. She had had no notion that the staff of Mon\r\nRepos had been augmented, and it seemed to her that Chimp had been sent\r\nfrom heaven. Here, right on the spot, in daily association with Hash,\r\nwas the desired male. She smiled dazzlingly upon Chimp.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” said Chimp.\r\n\r\nHe spoke moodily, for he was feeling moody. There might be golden\r\nrewards at the end of this venture of his, but he perceived already that\r\nthey would have to be earned. Last night Hash Todhunter had won six\r\nshilling from him at stud poker, and Chimp was a thrifty man. Moreover,\r\nHash slept in the top back room, and when not in it, locked the door.\r\n\r\nThis latter fact may seem to offer little material for gloom on Chimp’s\r\npart, but it was, indeed, the root of all his troubles. In informing Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Molloy that the plunder of the late Edward Finglass was hidden\r\nin the cistern of Mon Repos, Chimp Twist had been guilty of\r\nsubterfuge--pardonable, perhaps, for your man of affairs must take these\r\nlittle business precautions, but nevertheless subterfuge. In the letter\r\nwhich, after carefully memorising, he had just as carefully destroyed,\r\nMr. Finglass had revealed that the proceeds of his flutter with the New\r\nAsiatic Bank might be found not in the cistern but rather by anyone who\r\nprocured a chisel and raised the third board from the window in the top\r\nback room. Chimp had not foreseen that this top back room would be\r\noccupied by a short-tempered cook who, should he discover people prying\r\nup his floor with chisels, would scarcely fail to make himself\r\nunpleasant. That was why Mr. Twist spoke moodily to Claire, and who\r\nshall blame him?\r\n\r\nClaire was not discouraged. She had cast Chimp for the rôle of stalking\r\nhorse and he was going to be it.\r\n\r\n“Is the doggie having his bath?” she asked archly.\r\n\r\n“I think they’re splitting it about fifty-fifty,” said Sam, adding\r\nhimself to the conversation.\r\n\r\nClaire perceived that this was, indeed, so.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are wet,” she cried. “You’ll catch cold. Would you like a nice\r\ncup of hot tea?”\r\n\r\nSomething approaching gratitude appeared in Chimp’s mournful face.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, miss,” he said. “I would.”\r\n\r\n“We’re spoiling you,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe sauntered down the garden, plying his hose, and Claire hurried back\r\nto her kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Where’s my nice lettuce?” demanded Hash.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t got it yet. I’ve come in to get a cup of hot tea and a slice of\r\ncake for that young man next door. He’s got so wet washing that big\r\ndog.”\r\n\r\nIt was some little time before she returned.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been having a talk with that young man,” she said. “He liked his\r\ntea very much.”\r\n\r\n“Did he?” said Hash shortly. “Ho, did he? Where’s my lettuce?”\r\n\r\nClaire uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n“There! If I haven’t gone and forgotten it!”\r\n\r\nHash rose, a set look on his face.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” he said. “Never mind.”\r\n\r\n“You aren’t going?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am.”\r\n\r\n“What, already?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, already.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you must,” said Claire. “I like Mr. Twist,” she went on\r\npensively. “He’s what I call a perfect gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“He’s what I call a perisher,” said Hash sourly.\r\n\r\n“Nice way he’s got of speaking. His Christian name’s Alexander. Do you\r\ncall him that or Aleck?”\r\n\r\n“If you care to ’ear what I call him,” replied Hash with frigid\r\npoliteness, “you can come and listen at our kitchen door.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you surely aren’t jealous!” cried Claire, wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n“Who, me?” said Hash bitterly.\r\n\r\nIt was some few minutes later that Sam, watering his garden like a good\r\nhouseholder, heard sounds of tumult from within. Turning off his hose,\r\nhe hastened toward the house and reached it in time to observe the back\r\ndoor open with some violence and his new odd-job man emerge at a high\r\nrate of speed. A crockery implement of the kind used in kitchens\r\nfollowed the odd-job man, bursting like a shell against the brick wall\r\nwhich bounded the estate of Mon Repos. The odd-job man himself, heading\r\nfor the street, disappeared, and Sam, going into the kitchen, found Mr.\r\nTodhunter fuming.\r\n\r\n“Little tiff?” inquired Sam.\r\n\r\nHash gave vent to a few sailorly oaths.\r\n\r\n“He’s been flirting with my girl and I’ve been telling him off.”\r\n\r\nSam clicked his tongue.\r\n\r\n“Boys will be boys,” he said. “But, Hash, didn’t I gather from certain\r\nwords you let fall when you came home last night that your ardour was\r\nbeginning to wane a trifle?”\r\n\r\n“Ur?”\r\n\r\n“I say, from the way you spoke last night about the folly of hasty\r\nmarriages, I imagined that you had begun to experience certain regrets.\r\nIn other words, you gave me the impression of a man who would be glad to\r\nbe free from sentimental entanglements. Yet here you are\r\npositively--yes, by Jove, positively jousting!”\r\n\r\n“What say?”\r\n\r\n“I was quoting from a little thing I dashed off up at the office\r\nrecently. Have you changed your mind about hasty marriages then?”\r\n\r\nHash frowned perplexedly at the stove. He was not a man who found it\r\neasy to put his thoughts into words.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s like this: I saw her mother yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! That is a treat I have not had.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think girls get like their mothers, Sam?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes.”\r\n\r\nHash shivered.\r\n\r\n“Well, the ’ole thing is, when I’m away from the girl, I get to thinking\r\nabout her.”\r\n\r\n“Very properly,” said Sam. “Absence, it has been well said, makes the\r\nheart grow fonder.”\r\n\r\n“Thinking of her mother, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, of her mother?”\r\n\r\n“And then I wish I was well out of it all, you understand. But then\r\nagain, when I’m settin’ with ’er with my arm round ’er little waist----”\r\n\r\n“You are still speaking of the mother?”\r\n\r\n“No, the girl.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the girl?”\r\n\r\n“And when I’m lookin’ at her and she’s lookin’ at me, it’s different.\r\nIt’s--well, it’s what I may call different. She’s got a way of tossing\r\nher chin up, Sam, and waggling of ’er ’air----”\r\n\r\nSam nodded.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said, “I know. They have, haven’t they? Confirmed hair\r\nwagglers, all of them. Well, Hash, if you will listen to the advice of\r\nan old lady with girl friends in every part of England--and Scotland,\r\ntoo, for that matter; you will find a communication from Bonnie Lassie\r\n(Glasgow) in this very issue--I would say, Risk the mother. And\r\nmeanwhile, Hash, refrain, if possible, from slaying our odd-job man. He\r\nmay not be much to look at, but he is uncommonly useful. Never forget\r\nthat in a few days we may want Amy washed again.”\r\n\r\nHe bestowed an encouraging nod upon his companion and went out into the\r\ngarden. He was just picking up his hose when a scuffling sound from the\r\nother side of the fence attracted his attention. It was followed by a\r\nsharp exclamation, and he recognised Kay’s voice.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark now, but it was not too dark for Sam to see, if only\r\nsketchily, what was in progress in the garden of San Rafael. Shrouded\r\nthough the whole scene was in an evening mist, he perceived a male\r\nfigure. He also perceived the figure of Kay. The male figure appeared\r\neither to be giving Kay a lesson in jiujitsu or else embracing her\r\nagainst her will. From the sound of her voice, he put the latter\r\nconstruction on the affair, and it seemed to him that, in the inspired\r\nwords of the typewriter, now was the time for all good men to come to\r\nthe aid of the party.\r\n\r\nSam was a man of action. Several policies were open to him. He could\r\nignore the affair altogether; he could shout reproof at the aggressor\r\nfrom a distance; he could climb the fence and run to the rescue. None of\r\nthese operations appealed to him. It was his rule in life to act swiftly\r\nand to think, if at all, later. In his simple, direct fashion,\r\ntherefore, he lifted the hose and sent a stream of water shooting at the\r\nnow closely entangled pair.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe treatment was instantaneously effective. The male member of the\r\ncombination, receiving several gallons of the Valley Fields Water\r\nCompany’s best stuff on the side of his head and then distributed at\r\nrandom over his person, seemed to understand with a lightning quickness\r\nthat something in the nature of reinforcements had arrived. Hastily\r\npicking up his hat, which had fallen off, he stood not upon the order of\r\nhis going, but ran. The darkness closed upon him, and Sam, with a\r\ncertain smug complacency inevitable in your knight errant who has borne\r\nhimself notably well in a difficult situation, turned off the hose and\r\nstood waiting while Kay crossed the lawn.\r\n\r\n“Who was our guest?” he asked.\r\n\r\nKay seemed a little shaken. She was breathing quickly.\r\n\r\n“It was Claude Bates,” she said, and her voice quivered. So did Sam’s.\r\n\r\n“Claude Bates!” he cried distractedly. “If I had known that, I would\r\nhave chased him all the way back to London, kicking him violently.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you had.”\r\n\r\n“How on earth did that fellow come to be here?”\r\n\r\n“I met him outside Victoria Station. I suppose he got into the train and\r\nfollowed me.”\r\n\r\n“The hound!”\r\n\r\n“I suddenly found him out here in the garden.”\r\n\r\n“The blister!”\r\n\r\n“Do you think somebody will kill him some day?” asked Kay wistfully.\r\n\r\n“I shall have a very poor opinion of the public spirit of the modern\r\nEnglishman,” Sam assured her, “if that loathsome leprous growth is\r\npermitted to infest London for long. But in the meantime,” he said,\r\nlowering his voice tenderly, “doesn’t it occur to you that this thing\r\nhas been sent for a purpose? Surely it is intended as a proof of the\r\ntruth of what I was saying at lunch, that you need----”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Kay; “but we’ll talk about that some other time, if you\r\ndon’t mind. I suppose you know you’ve soaked me to the skin.”\r\n\r\n“You?” said Sam incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, me.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean Bates?”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not mean Bates. Feel my arm if you don’t believe me.”\r\n\r\nSam extended a reverent hand.\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinarily beautiful arm you have,” he said.\r\n\r\n“An extraordinarily wet arm.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are wet,” Sam acknowledged. “Well, all I can say is that I am\r\nextremely sorry. I acted for the best; impulsively, let us\r\nsay--mistakenly, it may be--but still with the best intentions.”\r\n\r\n“I should hate to be anywhere near when you are doing your worst. Well,\r\nthings like this, I suppose, must be----”\r\n\r\n“----after a famous victory. Exactly!”\r\n\r\n“I must run in and change.”\r\n\r\n“Wait!” said Sam. “We must get this thing straight. You will admit now,\r\nI imagine, that you need a strong man’s protection?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t admit anything of the kind.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“But surely, with Claude Bateses surging around you on every side,\r\ndogging your footsteps, forcing their way into your very garden, you\r\nmust acknowledge----”\r\n\r\n“I shall catch cold.”\r\n\r\n“Of course! What am I thinking of? You must run in at once.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But wait!” said Sam. “I want to get to the bottom of this. What makes\r\nyou think that you and I were not designed for each other from the\r\nbeginning of time? I’ve been thinking very deeply about the whole thing,\r\nand it beats me why you can’t see it. To start with, we are so much\r\nalike, we have the same tastes----”\r\n\r\n“Have we?”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly. To take a single instance, we both dislike Claude\r\nBates. Then there is your love, which I share, for a life in the\r\ncountry. The birds, the breezes, the trees, the bees--you love them and\r\nso do I. It is my one ambition to amass enough money to enable me to buy\r\na farm and settle down. You would like that.”\r\n\r\n“You seem to know a lot about me.”\r\n\r\n“I have my information from your uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you and uncle ever do any work at the office? You seem to spend\r\nyour whole time talking.”\r\n\r\n“In the process of getting together a paper like Pyke’s _Home\r\nCompanion_, there come times when a little rest, a little folding of the\r\nhands, is essential. Otherwise the machine would break down. On these\r\noccasions we chat, and when we chat we naturally talk about you.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because there is no other subject in which I am in the least\r\ninterested. Well, then, returning to what I was saying, we are so much\r\nalike----”\r\n\r\n“They say that people should marry their opposites.”\r\n\r\n“Pyke’s _Home Companion_ has exploded that view. Replying to Anxious\r\n(Wigan) in this very issue, Aunt Ysobel says just the contrary.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve often wondered who Aunt Ysobel was.”\r\n\r\n“It would be foreign to the policy of Pyke’s _Home Companion_ to reveal\r\noffice secrets. You may take it from me that Aunt Ysobel is the goods.\r\nShe knows. You might say she knows everything.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if she knows I’m getting pneumonia.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! I was forgetting. I mustn’t keep you standing here for\r\nanother instant.”\r\n\r\n“No. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Wait!” said Sam. “While we are on the subject of Aunt Ysobel, I wonder\r\nif you have seen her ruling this week in the case of Romeo\r\n(Middlesbrough)?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t read this week’s number.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Well, the gist of what she says--I quote from memory--is that there\r\nis nothing wrong in a young man taking a girl to the theatre, provided\r\nthat it is a matinée performance. On the contrary, the girl will\r\nconsider it a pretty and delicate attention. Now to-morrow will be\r\nSaturday, and I have in my possession two seats for the Winter Garden.\r\nWill you come?”\r\n\r\n“Does Aunt Ysobel say what the significance is if the girl accepts?”\r\n\r\n“It implies that she is beginning to return--slightly, it may be, but\r\nnevertheless perceptibly--the gentleman’s esteem.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Rather serious. I must think this over.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. And now, if I may suggest it, you really ought to be going\r\nin and changing your dress. You are very wet.”\r\n\r\n“So I am. You seem to know everything--like Aunt Ysobel.”\r\n\r\n“There is a resemblance, perhaps,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nHash Todhunter met Sam as he re-entered Mon Repos.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there you are,” said Hash. “There was some people calling, wanting\r\nto see you, a minute ago.”\r\n\r\n“Really? Who?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was a young female party that come to the door, but I thought\r\nI saw a kind of thickset feller hanging about down on the drive.”\r\n\r\n“My old friends, Thomas G. and Miss Gunn, no doubt. A persistent couple.\r\nDid they leave any message?”\r\n\r\n“No. She asked if you was in, and when I told her you was around\r\nsomewhere she said it didn’t matter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThat night. The apartments of Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\n“Yes? Yes? This is Lord Tilbury speaking.... Ah, is that you, Twist?\r\nHave you anything to report?”\r\n\r\n“The young woman’s cook has just been round with a message. The young\r\nwoman is going with Mr. Shotter to the theatre to-morrow afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Cor!” said Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\nHe replaced the receiver. He remained for a moment in the deepest\r\nthought. Then, swiftly reaching a decision, he went to the desk and took\r\nout a cable form.\r\n\r\nThe wording of the cable gave him some little trouble. The first version\r\nwas so condensed that he could not understand it himself. He destroyed\r\nthe form and decided that this was no time for that economy which is\r\ninstinctive even to the richest men when writing cables. Taking another\r\nform and recklessly dashing the expense, he informed Mr. Pynsent that,\r\nin spite of the writer’s almost fatherly care, his nephew Samuel had\r\nmost unfortunately sneaked off surreptitiously and become entangled with\r\na young woman residing in the suburbs. He desired Mr. Pynsent to\r\ninstruct him in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe composition satisfied him. It was a good piece of work. He rang for\r\nan underling and sent him with it to the cable office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\r\n\r\nSTORMY TIMES AT MON REPOS\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few pleasanter things in life than to sit under one’s own\r\nrooftree and smoke the first pipe of the morning which so sets the seal\r\non the charms of breakfast. Sam, as he watched Hash clearing away the\r\nremains of as goodly a dish of bacon and eggs and as fragrant a pot of\r\ncoffee as ever man had consumed, felt an uplifted thrill of well-being.\r\nIt was Saturday morning, and a darned good Saturday morning at\r\nthat--mild enough to permit of an open window, yet crisp enough to\r\njustify a glowing fire.\r\n\r\n“Hash,” said Sam, “have you ever felt an almost overwhelming desire to\r\nbreak into song?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Hash, after consideration.\r\n\r\n“You have never found yourself irresistibly compelled to render some old\r\nProvençal _chansonnette_ breathing of love and youth and romance?”\r\n\r\n“No, I ain’t.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it’s as well. You wouldn’t be good at it, and one must consider\r\nthe neighbours. But I may tell you that I am feeling the urge to-day.\r\nWhat’s that thing of Browning’s that you’re always quoting? Ah, yes!\r\n\r\n    ‘The morning’s at seven;\r\n      The hillside’s dew-pearled.\r\n    God’s in his heaven;\r\n      All’s right with the world.’\r\n\r\nThat is how I feel.”\r\n\r\n“How’d you like this bacon?” inquired Hash, picking up a derelict slice\r\nand holding it against the light as if it were some rare _objet d’art_.\r\n\r\nSam perceived that his audience was not attuned to the lyrical note.\r\n\r\n“I am too spiritual to be much of a judge of these things,” he said,\r\n“but as far as I could gather it seemed all right.”\r\n\r\n“Ha’penny a pound cheaper than the last,” said Hash with sober triumph.\r\n\r\n“Indeed? Well, as I was saying, life seems decidedly tolerable to-day. I\r\nam taking Miss Derrick to the theatre this afternoon, so I shall not be\r\nback until lateish. Before I go, therefore, I have something to say to\r\nyou, Hash. I noticed a disposition on your part yesterday to try to\r\ndisintegrate our odd-job man. This must not be allowed to grow upon you.\r\nWhen I return this evening I shall expect to find him all in one piece.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, Sam,” replied Mr. Todhunter cordially. “All that\r\n’appened there was that I let myself get what I might call rather ’asty.\r\nI been thinking it over, and I’ve got nothing against the feller.”\r\n\r\nThis was true. Sleep, which knits up the ravelled sleeve of care, had\r\ndone much to soothe the troubled spirit of Hash Todhunter. The healing\r\neffect of a night’s slumber had been to convince him that he had\r\nwronged Claire. He proceeded to get Sam’s expert views on this.\r\n\r\n“Suppose it was this way, Sam: Suppose a feller’s young lady went and\r\ngive another feller a cup of hot tea and cut him a slice of cake. That\r\nwouldn’t ’ave to mean that she was flirting with ’im, would it?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Sam warmly. “Far from it. I would call it evidence of\r\nthe kind heart rather than the frivolous mind.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“I may be dangerously modern,” said Sam, “but my view--and I give it\r\nfearlessly--is that a girl may cut many a slice of cake and still remain\r\na good, sweet, womanly woman.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” argued Hash, “he was wet.”\r\n\r\n“Who was wet?”\r\n\r\n“This feller Twist. Along of washing the dog. And Claire, she took and\r\ngive him a nice cup of hot tea and a slice of cake. Upset me at the\r\ntime, I’ll own, but I see where maybe I done ’er an injustice.”\r\n\r\n“You certainly did, Hash. That girl is always doing that sort of thing\r\nout of pure nobility of nature. Why, the first morning I was here she\r\ngave me a complete breakfast--eggs, bacon, toast, coffee, marmalade and\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\n“No, did she?”\r\n\r\n“You bet she did. She’s a jewel, and you’re lucky to get her.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Hash with fervour.\r\n\r\nHe gathered up the tray alertly and bore it downstairs to the kitchen,\r\nwhere Chimp Twist eyed him warily. Although on his return to the house\r\non the previous night Chimp had suffered no injury at Hash’s hands, he\r\nattributed this solely to the intervention of Sam, who had insisted on a\r\nformal reconciliation; and he had just heard the front door bang behind\r\nSam. A nervous man who shrank from personal violence, particularly when\r\nit promised to be so one-sided as in his present society, Chimp felt\r\napprehensive.\r\n\r\nHe was reassured by the geniality of his companion’s manner.\r\n\r\n“Nice day,” said Hash.\r\n\r\n“Lovely,” said Chimp, relieved.\r\n\r\n“’As that dog ’ad ’er breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“She was eating a shoe when I saw her last.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, maybe that’ll do her till dinnertime. Nice dog.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Nice weather.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes.”\r\n\r\n“If the rain ’olds off, it’ll be a regular nice day.”\r\n\r\n“It certainly will.”\r\n\r\n“And if it rains,” continued Hash, sunnily optimistic, “I see by the\r\npaper that the farmers need it.”\r\n\r\nIt was a scene which would have rejoiced the heart of Henry Ford or any\r\nother confirmed peacemaker; and Chimp, swift, in his canny fashion, to\r\ntake advantage of his companion’s miraculous cordiality, put a tentative\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Sleep well last night?”\r\n\r\n“Like a top.”\r\n\r\n“So did I. Say,” said Chimp enthusiastically, “that’s a swell bed I’ve\r\ngot.”\r\n\r\n“Ah?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, that’s one swell bed. And a dandy room too. And I been\r\nthinking it over, and it don’t seem right that I should have that dandy\r\nroom and that swell bed, seeing that I came here after you. So what say\r\nwe exchange?”\r\n\r\n“Change rooms?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; you have my swell big front room and I have your poky little\r\nback room.”\r\n\r\nThe one fault which undoes diplomatists more than any other is the\r\ntemptation to be too elaborate. If it had been merely a case of\r\nexchanging rooms, as two medieval monarchs, celebrating a truce, might\r\nhave exchanged chargers and suits of armour, Hash would probably have\r\nconsented. He would have thought it silly, but he would have done it by\r\nway of a gesture indicating his opinion of the world’s excellence this\r\nmorning and of his desire to show Mr. Twist that he had forgiven him and\r\nwished him well. But the way the other put it made it impossible for any\r\nman feeling as generous and amiable as he did to become a party to a\r\nscheme for turning this charming fellow out of a swell front room and\r\nputting him in a poky back one.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t do it,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I cert’nly wish you would.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Hash. “No; couldn’t do it.”\r\n\r\nChimp sighed and returned to his solitaire. Hash, full of the milk of\r\nhuman kindness, went out into the garden. It had occurred to him that at\r\nabout this time of day Claire generally took a breather in the open\r\nafter the rough work of making the beds. She was strolling up and down\r\nthe gravel path.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” said Hash. “Nice day.”\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of the pathos of life comes from the\r\nmisunderstandings that arise between male and female through the\r\ninability of a man with an untrained voice to convey the emotions\r\nunderlying his words. Hash supposed that he had spoken in a way that\r\nwould show Claire that he considered her an angel of light and a credit\r\nto her sex. If he was slightly more formal than usual, that was because\r\nhe was feeling embarrassed at the thought of the injustice he had done\r\nher at their last meeting.\r\n\r\nClaire, however, noting the formality--for it was customary with him to\r\ncouch his morning’s greeting in some such phrase as “Hullo, ugly!” or\r\n“What cheer, face!”--attributed it to that growing coldness of which she\r\nhad recently become aware. Her heart sank. She became provocative.\r\n\r\n“How’s Mr. Twist this morning?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s fine.”\r\n\r\n“Not been quarrelling with him, have you?”\r\n\r\n“Who, me?” cried Hash, shocked. “Why, him and me is the best of\r\nfriends!”\r\n\r\n“Oh?”\r\n\r\n“We just been having a chat.”\r\n\r\n“About me?”\r\n\r\n“No; about the weather and the dog and how well we slept last night.”\r\n\r\nClaire scraped at the gravel with the toe of her shoe.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Well, I’ve got to go and wash the dishes,” she said. “Goo’\r\nmornin’.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nHash Todhunter was not a swift-thinking man. Nor was he one of those\r\npractised amateurs of the sex who can read volumes in a woman’s glance\r\nand see in a flash exactly what she means when she scrapes arabesques on\r\na gravel path with the toe of her shoe. For some three hours and more,\r\ntherefore, he remained in a state of perfect content. And then suddenly,\r\nwhile smoking a placid after-luncheon pipe, his mood changed and there\r\nbegan to seep into the hinterlands of his mind the idea that in Claire’s\r\nmanner at their recent meeting there had been something decidedly\r\npeculiar.\r\n\r\nHe brooded over this; and as the lunch which he had cooked and eaten\r\nfought what was for the moment a winning battle with his organs of\r\ndigestion, there crept over him a sombre alarm. Slowly, but with a\r\npersistence not to be denied, the jealousy of which sleep had cured him\r\nbegan to return. He blew out a cloud of tobacco smoke and through it\r\nstared bleakly at Chimp Twist, who was in a reverie on the other side of\r\nthe kitchen table.\r\n\r\nIt came to him, not for the first time, that he did not like Chimp’s\r\nlooks. Handsome not even his mother could have called Chimp Twist; and\r\nyet there was about him a certain something calculated to inspire\r\nuneasiness in an engaged man. He had that expression in his eyes which\r\nhome wreckers wear in the movies. A human snake, if ever there was one,\r\nfelt Hash, as his interior mechanism strove vainly to overcome that\r\nwhich he had thrust upon it.\r\n\r\nNor did his recollection of Claire’s conversation bring any reassurance.\r\nSo brief it had been that he could remember everything she had said.\r\nAnd it had all been about that black-hearted little object across the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“How’s Mr. Twist this morning?” A significant question. “Not been\r\nquarrelling with him, have you?” A fishy remark. And then he had said\r\nthat they had been having a chat, and she had asked, “About me?”\r\n\r\nSo moved was Hash by the recollection of this that he took the pipe out\r\nof his mouth and addressed his companion with an abruptness that was\r\nalmost violent:\r\n\r\n“Hey!”\r\n\r\nChimp looked up with a start. He had been pondering whether it might not\r\npossibly come within the scope of an odd-job man’s duties to put a\r\nladder against the back of the house and climb up it and slap a coat of\r\npaint on the window frame of the top back room. Then, when Hash was\r\ncooking dinner----\r\n\r\n“Hullo?” he said, blinking. He was surprised to see that the other, who\r\nhad been geniality itself during lunch, was regarding him with a cold\r\nand suspicious hostility.\r\n\r\n“Want to ask you something,” said Hash.\r\n\r\n“Spill it,” said Chimp, and smiled nervously.\r\n\r\nIt was an unfortunate thing for him to have done, for he did not look\r\nhis best when smiling. It seemed to Hash that his smile was furtive and\r\ncunning.\r\n\r\n“Want to know,” said Hash, “if there are any larks on?”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“You and my young lady next door--there’s nothing what you might call\r\nbetween you, is there?”\r\n\r\n“’Course not!” cried Chimp in agitation.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Hash weightily, “there better hadn’t be. See?”\r\n\r\nHe rose, feeling a little better, and, his suspicions momentarily\r\nquieted, he proceeded to the garden, where he chirruped for a while over\r\nthe fence. This producing no response, he climbed the fence and peeped\r\nin through the kitchen window of San Rafael. The kitchen was empty.\r\n\r\n“Gone for a walk,” diagnosed Hash, and felt a sense of injury. If Claire\r\nwanted to go for a walk, why hadn’t she asked him to come too? He did\r\nnot like it. It seemed to him that love must have grown cold. He\r\nreturned to Mon Repos and embarrassed the sensitive Mr. Twist by staring\r\nat him for twenty minutes almost without a blink.\r\n\r\nClaire had not gone for a walk. She had taken the 12:10 train to\r\nVictoria and had proceeded thence to Mr. Braddock’s house in John\r\nStreet. It was her intention to put the facts before her mother and from\r\nthat experienced woman to seek advice in this momentous crisis of her\r\nlife. Her faith in Aunt Ysobel had not weakened, but there is never any\r\nharm done by getting the opinion of a second specialist. For Claire’s\r\nuneasiness had been growing ever since that talk with Hash across the\r\nfence that morning. His manner had seemed to her peculiar. Nor did her\r\nrecollection of his conversation bring any reassurance.\r\n\r\n“How’s Mr. Twist this morning?” she had asked. And instead of looking\r\nlike one about to joust, he had replied heartily, “Oh, he’s fine.” A\r\ndisturbing remark.\r\n\r\nAnd then he had gone on to say that he and Chimp were the best of\r\nfriends. It was with tight lips and hard eyes that Claire, replying\r\nabsently to the paternal badinage of Sleddon, the butler, made her way\r\ninto her mother’s presence. Mrs. Lippett, consulted, proved\r\nuncompromisingly pro-Aunt Ysobel.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I call a sensible woman, Clara.”\r\n\r\n“Claire,” corrected her daughter mechanically.\r\n\r\n“She knows.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I think.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, she’s suffered, that woman has,” said Mrs. Lippett. “You can see\r\nthat. Stands to reason she couldn’t know so much about life if she\r\nhadn’t suffered.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’d go on testing him?” said Claire anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Test him more and more,” said Mrs. Lippett. “There’s no other way.\r\nYou’ve got to remember, dearie, that your Clarence is a sailor, and\r\nsailors has to be handled firm. They say sailors don’t care. I say they\r\nmust be made to care. That’s what I say.”\r\n\r\nClaire made the return journey on an omnibus. For purposes of thought\r\nthere is nothing like a ride on the top of an omnibus. By four o’clock,\r\nwhen the vehicle put her down at the corner of Burberry Road, her\r\nresolution was as chilled steel and she had got her next move all\r\nplanned out. She went into the kitchen for a few moments, and coming out\r\ninto the garden, perceived Hash roaming the lawn of Mon Repos.\r\n\r\n“Hi!” she called, and into her voice managed to project a note of\r\ncare-free liveliness.\r\n\r\n“Where you been?” inquired Hash.\r\n\r\n“I been up seeing mother.... Is Mr. Twist indoors?”\r\n\r\n“What do you want with Mr. Twist?”\r\n\r\n“Just wanted to give him this--something I promised him.”\r\n\r\nThis was an envelope, lilac in colour and scent, and Hash, taking it and\r\ngazing upon it as he might have gazed upon an adder nestling in his\r\npalm, made a disturbing discovery.\r\n\r\n“There’s something inside this.”\r\n\r\n“Of course there is. If there wasn’t, what ’ud I be giving it him for?”\r\n\r\nHash’s fingers kneaded the envelope restlessly.\r\n\r\n“What you writing to him about?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind.”\r\n\r\n“There’s something else inside this ’ere envelope besides a letter.\r\nThere’s something that sort of crinkles when you squeeze it.”\r\n\r\n“Just a little present I promised to give him.”\r\n\r\nA monstrous suspicion flamed in Hash Todhunter’s mind. It seemed\r\ninconceivable, and yet---- He tore open the envelope and found his\r\nsuspicion fulfilled. Between his fingers there dangled a lock of\r\ntow-coloured hair.\r\n\r\n“When you’ve finished opening other people’s letters----” said Claire.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, hopefully at first, and then with a growing despair.\r\nFor Hash’s face was wooden and expressionless.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad,” said Hash huskily at length. “I been worried, but now I’m\r\nnot worried. I been worried because I been worrying about you and me not\r\nbeing suited to one another and ’aving acted ’asty; but now I’m not\r\nworried, because I see there’s another feller you’re fond of, so the\r\nworry about what was to be done and everything don’t worry me no more.\r\nHe’s in the kitchen,” said Hash in a gentle rumble. “I’ll give him this\r\nand explain ’ow it come to be opened in error.”\r\n\r\nNothing could have exceeded the dignity of his manner, but there are\r\nmoments when women chafe at masculine dignity.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you going to knock his head off?” demanded Claire distractedly.\r\n\r\n“Me?” said Hash, looking as nearly as he could like the picture of Saint\r\nSebastian in the Louvre. “Me? Why should I knock the pore feller’s ’ead\r\noff? I’m glad. Because I was worried, and now I’m not worried--see what\r\nI mean?”\r\n\r\nBefore Claire’s horrified eyes and through a world that rocked and\r\ndanced, he strode toward the kitchen of Mon Repos, bearing the envelope\r\ndaintily between finger and thumb. He seemed calm and at peace. He\r\nlooked as if he might be humming.\r\n\r\nInside the kitchen, however, his manner changed. Chimp Twist, glancing\r\nup from his solitaire, observed in the doorway, staring down at him, a\r\nface that seemed to his excited imagination to have been equipped with\r\nsearchlights instead of eyes. Beneath these searchlights was a mouth\r\nthat appeared to be gnashing its teeth. And from this mouth, in a brief\r\ninterval of gnashing, proceeded dreadful words.\r\n\r\nThe first that can be printed were the words “Put ’em up!”\r\n\r\nMr. Twist, rising, slid like an eel to the other side of the table.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” he demanded in considerable agitation.\r\n\r\n“I’ll show you what’s the matter,” said Hash, after another verbal\r\ninterlude which no compositor would be allowed by his union to set up.\r\n“Come out from behind that table like a man and put your ’ands up!”\r\n\r\nMr. Twist rejected this invitation.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to take your ’ead,” continued Hash, sketching out his plans,\r\n“and I’m going to pull it off, and then----”\r\n\r\nWhat he proposed to do after this did not intrigue Chimp. He foiled a\r\nsudden dash with an inspired leap.\r\n\r\n“Come ’ere,” said Hash coaxingly.\r\n\r\nHis mind clearing a little, he perceived that the root of the trouble,\r\nthe obstacle which was standing in the way of his aims, was the table.\r\nIt was a heavy table, but with a sharp heave he tilted it on its side\r\nand pushed it toward the stove. Chimp, his first line of defense thus\r\ndemolished, shot into the open, and Hash was about to make another\r\noffensive movement when the dog Amy, who had been out in the garden\r\nmaking a connoisseur’s inspection of the dustbin, strolled in and\r\nobserved with pleasure that a romp was in progress.\r\n\r\nAmy was by nature a thoughtful dog. Most of her time, when she was not\r\neating or sleeping, she spent in wandering about with wrinkled forehead,\r\npuzzling over the cosmos. But she could unbend. Like so many\r\nphilosophers, she loved an occasional frolic, and this one appeared to\r\nbe of exceptional promise.\r\n\r\nThe next moment Hash, leaping forward, found his movements impeded by\r\nwhat seemed like several yards of dog. It was hard for him to tell\r\nwithout sorting the tangle out whether she was between his legs or\r\nleaning on his shoulder. Certainly she was licking his face; but on the\r\nother hand, he had just kicked her with a good deal of violence, which\r\nseemed to indicate that she was on a lower level.\r\n\r\n“Get out!” cried Hash.\r\n\r\nThe remark was addressed to Amy, but the advice it contained was so\r\nadmirable that Chimp Twist acted on it without hesitation. In the swirl\r\nof events he had found himself with a clear path to the door, and along\r\nthis path he shot without delay. And not until he had put the entire\r\nlength of Burberry Road between him and his apparently insane aggressor\r\ndid he pause.\r\n\r\nThen he mopped his forehead and said, “Gee!”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Chimp Twist that a long walk was indicated--a walk so long\r\nthat by the time he reached Mon Repos again, Sam, his preserver, would\r\nhave returned and would be on the spot to protect him.\r\n\r\nHash, meanwhile, raged, baffled. He had extricated himself from Amy and\r\nhad rushed out into the road, but long ere that his victim had\r\ndisappeared. He went back to try to find Amy and rebuke her, but Amy had\r\ndisappeared too. In spite of her general dreaminess, there was sterling\r\ncommon sense in Amy. She knew when and when not to be among those\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nHash returned to his kitchen and remained there, seething. He had been\r\nseething for perhaps a quarter of an hour, when the front doorbell rang.\r\nHe climbed the stairs gloomily; and such was his disturbed frame of\r\nmind that not even the undeniable good looks of the visitor who had rung\r\ncould soothe him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Shotter in?”\r\n\r\nHe recognised her now. It was the young party that had called on the\r\nprevious evening, asking for Sam. And, as on that occasion, he seemed to\r\nsee through the growing darkness the same sturdy male person hovering\r\nabout in the shadows.\r\n\r\n“No, miss, he ain’t.”\r\n\r\n“Expecting him back soon?”\r\n\r\n“No, miss, I ain’t. He’s gone to the theatre, to a mat-i-nay.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the lady, “is that so?” And she made a sudden, curious\r\ngesture with her parasol.\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” said Hash, melting a little, for her eyes were very bright.\r\n\r\n“Can’t be helped. You all alone here then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Tough luck.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t mind, miss,” said Hash, pleased by her sympathy.\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t keep you. ’Devening.”\r\n\r\n“’Evening, miss.”\r\n\r\nHash closed the door. Whistling a little, for his visitor had lightened\r\nsomehow the depression which was gnawing at him, he descended the stairs\r\nand entered the kitchen.\r\n\r\nSomething which appeared at first acquaintance to be the ceiling, the\r\nupper part of the house and a ton of bricks thrown in for good measure\r\nhit Hash on the head and he subsided gently on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nSoapy Molloy came to the front door and opened it. He was a little pale,\r\nand he breathed heavily.\r\n\r\n“All right?” said his wife eagerly.\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“Tied him up?”\r\n\r\n“With a clothesline.”\r\n\r\n“How about if he hollers?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve put a duster in his mouth.”\r\n\r\n“At-a-boy!” said Mrs. Molloy. “Then let’s get action.”\r\n\r\nThey climbed the stairs to where the cistern stood, and Mr. Molloy,\r\nremoving his coat, rolled up his sleeves.\r\n\r\nSome minutes passed, and then Mr. Molloy, red in the face and wet in the\r\narm, made a remark.\r\n\r\n“But it must be there!” cried his wife.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t looked.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve looked everywhere. There couldn’t be a toothpick in that thing\r\nwithout I’d have found it.” He expelled a long breath and his face grew\r\nbleak. “Know what I think?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“That little oil can, Chimp, has slipped one over on us--told us the\r\nwrong place.”\r\n\r\nThe plausibility of this theory was so obvious that Mrs. Molloy made no\r\nattempt to refute it. She bit her lip in silence.\r\n\r\n“Then let’s you and me get busy and find the right place,” she said at\r\nlength, with the splendid fortitude of a great woman. “We know the\r\nstuff’s in the house somewheres, and we got the place to ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“It’s taking a chance,” said Mr. Molloy doubtfully. “Suppose somebody\r\nwas to come and find us here.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, all you would do would be to just simply haul off and bust\r\nthem one, same as you did the hired man.”\r\n\r\n“’M, yes,” said Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\r\n\r\nSOAPY MOLLOY’S BUSY AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unwelcome discovery of the perfidy of Chimp Twist had been made by\r\nMr. Molloy and his bride at about twenty minutes past four. At 4:30 a\r\nnatty two-seater car drew up at the gate of San Rafael and Willoughby\r\nBraddock alighted. Driving aimlessly about the streets of London some\r\nforty minutes earlier, and feeling rather at a loose end, it had\r\noccurred to him that a pleasant way of passing the evening would be to\r\ngo down to Valley Fields and get Kay to give him a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock was in a mood of the serenest happiness. And if this seems\r\nstrange, seeing that only recently he had had a proposal of marriage\r\nrejected, it should be explained that he had regretted that hasty\r\nproposal within two seconds of dropping the letter in the letter box.\r\nAnd he had come to the conclusion that, much as he liked Kay, what had\r\ninduced him to offer her his hand and heart had been the fact that he\r\nhad had a good deal of champagne at dinner and that its after effects\r\nhad consisted of a sort of wistful melancholy which had removed for the\r\ntime his fundamental distaste for matrimony. He did not want matrimony;\r\nhe wanted adventure. He had not yet entirely abandoned hope that some\r\nmiracle might occur to remove Mrs. Lippett from the scheme of things;\r\nand when that happened, he wished to be free.\r\n\r\nYes, felt Willoughby Braddock, everything had turned out extremely well.\r\nHe pushed open the gate of San Rafael with the debonair flourish of a\r\nman without entanglements. As he did so, the front door opened and Mr.\r\nWrenn came out.\r\n\r\n“Oh, hullo,” said Mr. Braddock. “Kay in?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid not,” said Mr. Wrenn. “She has gone to the theatre.”\r\nPoliteness to a visitor wrestled with the itch to be away. “I fear I\r\nhave an engagement also, for which I am already a little late. I\r\npromised Cornelius----”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right. I’ll go in next door and have a chat with Sam\r\nShotter.”\r\n\r\n“He has gone to the theatre with Kay.”\r\n\r\n“A washout, in short,” said Mr. Braddock with undiminished cheerfulness.\r\n“Right-ho! Then I’ll pop.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear fellow, you mustn’t run away like this,” said Mr. Wrenn\r\nwith remorse. “Why don’t you come in and have a cup of tea and wait for\r\nKay? Claire will bring you some if you ring.”\r\n\r\n“Something in that,” agreed Mr. Braddock. “Sound, very sound.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke a few genial words of farewell and proceeded to the\r\ndrawing-room, where he rang the bell. Nothing ensuing, he went to the\r\ntop of the kitchen stairs and called down.\r\n\r\n“I say!” Silence from below. “I say!” fluted Mr. Braddock once more, and\r\nnow it seemed to him that the silence had been broken by a sound--a\r\nrummy sound--a sound that was like somebody sobbing.\r\n\r\nHe went down the stairs. It was somebody sobbing. Bunched up on a chair,\r\nwith her face buried in her arms, that weird girl Claire was crying like\r\nthe dickens.\r\n\r\n“I say!” said Mr. Braddock.\r\n\r\nThere is this peculiar quality about tears--that they can wash away in a\r\nmoment the animosity of a lifetime. For years Willoughby Braddock had\r\nbeen on terms of distant hostility with this girl. Even apart from the\r\nfact that that affair of the onion had not ceased to rankle in his\r\nbosom, there had been other causes of war between them. Mr. Braddock\r\nstill suspected that it was Claire who, when on the occasion of his\r\neighteenth birthday he had called at Midways in a top hat, had flung a\r\nstone at that treasured object from the recesses of a shrubbery. One of\r\nthose things impossible of proof, the outrage had been allowed to become\r\na historic mystery; but Willoughby Braddock had always believed the\r\nhidden hand to be Claire’s, and his attitude toward her from that day\r\nhad been one of stiff disapproval.\r\n\r\nBut now, seeing her weeping and broken before him, with all the infernal\r\ncheek which he so deprecated swept away on a wave of woe, his heart\r\nsoftened. It has been a matter of much speculation among historians what\r\nWellington would have done if Napoleon had cried at Waterloo.\r\n\r\n“I say,” said Mr. Braddock, “what’s the matter? Anything up?”\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice seemed to penetrate Claire’s grief. She sat up\r\nand looked at him damply.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Braddock,” she moaned, “I’m so wretched! I am so miserable, Mr.\r\nBraddock!”\r\n\r\n“There, there!” said Willoughby Braddock.\r\n\r\n“How was I to know?”\r\n\r\n“Know what?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t tell.”\r\n\r\n“Tell which?”\r\n\r\n“I never had a notion he would act like that.”\r\n\r\n“Who would like what?”\r\n\r\n“Hash.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve spoiled the hash?” said Mr. Braddock, still out of his depth.\r\n\r\n“My Hash--Clarence. He took it the wrong way.”\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Braddock began to see daylight. She had cooked hash for this\r\nClarence, whoever he might be, and he had swallowed it in so erratic a\r\nmanner that it had choked him.\r\n\r\n“Is he dead?” he asked in a hushed voice.\r\n\r\nA piercing scream rang through the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Oh! Oh!”\r\n\r\n“My dear old soul!”\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t do that, would he?”\r\n\r\n“Do what?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Braddock, do say he wouldn’t do that!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by ‘that’?”\r\n\r\n“Go and kill himself.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Hash.”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock removed the perfectly folded silk handkerchief from his\r\nbreast pocket and passed it across his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” he said limply, “you couldn’t tell me the whole thing from\r\nthe beginning in a few simple words, could you?”\r\n\r\nHe listened with interest as Claire related the events of the day.\r\n\r\n“Then Clarence is Hash?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And Hash is Clarence?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; everyone calls him Hash.”\r\n\r\n“That was what was puzzling me,” said Mr. Braddock, relieved. “That was\r\nthe snag that I got up against all the time. Now that is clear, we can\r\nbegin to examine this thing in a calm and judicial spirit. Let’s see if\r\nI’ve got it straight. You read this stuff in the paper and started\r\ntesting him--is that right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. And instead of jousting, he just turned all cold-like and broke\r\noff the engagement.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Well, dash it, the thing’s simple. All you want is for some\r\npolished man of the world to take the blighter aside and apprise him of\r\nthe facts. Shall I pop round and see him now?”\r\n\r\nClaire’s tear-stained face lit up as if a light had been switched on\r\nbehind her eyes. She eyed Mr. Braddock devotedly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you only would!”\r\n\r\n“Of course I will--like a shot.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are good! I’m sorry I threw that onion at you, Mr. Braddock.”\r\n\r\n“Fault’s on both sides,” said Mr. Braddock magnanimously. “Now you stop\r\ncrying, like a good girl, and powder your nose and all that, and I’ll\r\nhave the lad round all pleasant and correct in a couple of minutes.”\r\n\r\nHe patted Claire’s head in a brotherly fashion and trotted out through\r\nthe back door.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, Mr. and Mrs. Molloy, searching feverishly in the\r\ndrawing-room of Mon Repos, heard a distant tinkle and looked at each\r\nother with a wild surmise.\r\n\r\n“It’s the back doorbell,” said Dolly.\r\n\r\n“I told you,” said Mr. Molloy sombrely. “I knew this would happen.\r\nWhat’ll we do?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Molloy was not the woman to be shaken for long.\r\n\r\n“Why, go downstairs and answer it,” she said. “It’s prob’ly only a\r\ntradesman come with a loaf of bread or something. He’ll think you’re the\r\nhelp.”\r\n\r\n“And if he doesn’t,” replied Mr. Molloy with some bitterness, “I suppose\r\nI bust him one with the meat ax. Looks to me as if I shall have to lay\r\nout the whole darned population of this blamed place before I’m\r\nthrough.”\r\n\r\n“Sweetie mustn’t be cross.”\r\n\r\n“Sweetie’s about fed up,” said Mr. Molloy sombrely.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nExpecting, when he opened the back door, to see a tradesman with a\r\nbasket on his arm, Soapy Molloy found no balm to his nervous system in\r\nthe apparition of a young man of the leisured classes in a faultlessly\r\ncut grey suit. He gaped at Mr. Braddock.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” said Mr. Braddock.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” said Soapy.\r\n\r\n“Are you Hash?” inquired the ambassador.\r\n\r\n“Pardon?”\r\n\r\n“Is your name Clarence?”\r\n\r\nIn happier circumstances Soapy would have denied the charge indignantly;\r\nbut now he decided that it was politic to be whatever anyone wished him\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n“That’s me, brother,” he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock greatly disliked being called brother, but he made no\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n“Well, I just buzzed round,” he said, “to tell you that everything’s all\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nSoapy was far from agreeing with him. He was almost equally far from\r\nunderstanding a word that this inexplicable visitor was saying. He\r\ncoughed loudly, to drown a strangled sound that had proceeded from the\r\ngagged and bound Hash, whom he had deposited in a corner by the range.\r\n\r\n“That’s good,” he said.\r\n\r\n“About the girl, I mean. Claire, you know. I was in the kitchen next\r\ndoor a moment ago, and she was crying and howling and all that because\r\nshe thought you didn’t love her any more.”\r\n\r\n“Too bad,” said Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\n“It seems,” went on Mr. Braddock, “that she read something in a paper,\r\nwritten by some silly ass, which said that she ought to test your\r\naffection by pretending to flirt with some other cove. And when she did,\r\nyou broke off the engagement. And the gist, if you understand me, of\r\nwhat I buzzed round to say is that she loves you still and was only\r\nfooling when she sent that other bloke the lock of hair.”\r\n\r\n“Ah?” said Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\n“So it’s all right, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right by me,” said Mr. Molloy, wishing--for it sounded\r\ninteresting--that he knew what all this was about.\r\n\r\n“Then that’s that, what?”\r\n\r\n“You said it, brother.”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock paused. He seemed disappointed at a certain lack of emotion\r\non his companion’s part.\r\n\r\n“She’s rather expecting you to dash round right away, you know--fold her\r\nin your arms, and all that.”\r\n\r\nThis was a complication which Soapy had not foreseen.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll tell you,” he said. “I’ve a lot of work to do around this\r\nhouse and I don’t quite see how I can get away. Say, listen, brother,\r\nyou tell her I’ll be round later on in the evening.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I’m glad everything’s satisfactory. She’s a nice girl\r\nreally.”\r\n\r\n“None better,” said Mr. Molloy generously.\r\n\r\n“I still think she threw a stone at my top hat that day, but dash it,”\r\nsaid Mr. Braddock warmly, “let the dead past bury its dead, what?”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t do a wiser thing,” said Mr. Molloy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe closed the door; and having breathed a little stertorously, mounted\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n“Who was it?” called Dolly from the first landing.\r\n\r\n“Some nut babbling about a girl.”\r\n\r\n“Oh? Well, I’m having a hunt round in the best bedroom. You go on\r\nlooking in the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\nSoapy turned his steps towards the drawing-room, but he did not reach\r\nit. For as he was preparing to cross the threshold, the front doorbell\r\nrang.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Soapy that he was being called upon to endure more than man\r\nwas ever intended to bear. That, at least, was his view as he dragged\r\nhis reluctant feet to the door. It was only when he opened it that he\r\nrealised that he had underestimated the malevolence of fate. Standing on\r\nthe top step was a policeman.\r\n\r\n“Hell!” cried Soapy. And while we blame him for the intemperate\r\nejaculation, we must in fairness admit that the situation seemed to call\r\nfor some such remark. He stood goggling, a chill like the stroke of an\r\nicy finger running down his spine.\r\n\r\n“’Evening, sir,” said the policeman. “Mr. Shotter?”\r\n\r\nSoapy’s breath returned.\r\n\r\n“That’s me,” he said huskily. This thing, coming so soon after his\r\nunrehearsed impersonation of Hash Todhunter, made him feel the sort of\r\ndizzy feeling which a small-part actor must experience who has to open a\r\nplay as Jervis, a footman, and then rush up to his dressing room, make a\r\ncomplete change and return five minutes later as Lord George Spelvin,\r\none of Lady Hemmingway’s guests at The Towers.\r\n\r\nThe policeman fumbled in the recesses of his costume.\r\n\r\n“Noo resident, sir, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then you will doubtless be glad,” said the policeman, shutting\r\nhis eyes and beginning to speak with great rapidity, as if he\r\nwere giving evidence in court, “of the opportunity to support a\r\ncharitibulorganization which is not only most deserving in itself but\r\nis connected with a body of men to ’oom you as a house-’older will be\r\nthe first to admit that you owe the safety of your person and the\r\ntranquillity of your home--the police,” explained the officer, opening\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy did not look on the force in quite this light, but he could\r\nnot hurt the man’s feelings by saying so.\r\n\r\n“This charitibulorganizationtowhichIallude,” resumed the constable,\r\nshutting his eyes again, “is the Policeman’s Orphanage, for which I have\r\nbeen told of--one of several others--to sell tickets for the annual\r\nconcert of, to be ’eld at the Oddfellows ‘All in Ogilvy Street on the\r\ncoming sixteenth prox. Tickets, which may be purchased in any quantity\r\nor number, consist of the five-shilling ticket, the half-crown ticket,\r\nthe two-shilling ticket, the shilling ticket and the sixpenny ticket.”\r\nHe opened his eyes. “May I have the pleasure of selling you and your\r\ngood lady a couple of the five-shilling?”\r\n\r\n“If I may add such weight as I possess to the request, I should\r\ncertainly advocate the purchase, Mr. Shotter. It is a most excellent and\r\ndeserving charity.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a gentleman in clerical dress who had appeared from\r\nnowhere and was standing at the constable’s side. His voice caused Soapy\r\na certain relief; for when, a moment before, a second dark figure had\r\nsuddenly manifested itself on the top step, he had feared that the\r\nstrain of the larger life was causing him to see double.\r\n\r\n“I take it that I am addressing Mr. Shotter?” continued the new-comer.\r\nHe was a hatchet-faced man with penetrating eyes and for one awful\r\nmoment he had looked to Soapy exactly like Sherlock Holmes. “I have just\r\ntaken up my duties as vicar of this parish, and I am making a little\r\npreliminary round of visits so that I may become acquainted with my\r\nparishioners. Mr. Cornelius, the house agent, very kindly gave me a list\r\nof names. May I introduce myself?--the Rev. Aubrey Jerningham.”\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that the world knows little of its greatest men.\r\nThis name, which would have thrilled Kay Derrick, made no impression\r\nupon Soapy Molloy. He was not a great reader; and when he did read, it\r\nwas something a little lighter and more on the zippy side than _Is There\r\na Hell?_\r\n\r\n“How do?” he said gruffly.\r\n\r\n“And ’ow many of the five-shilling may I sell you and your good lady?”\r\ninquired the constable. His respect for the cloth had kept him silent\r\nthrough the recent conversation, but now he seemed to imply that\r\nbusiness is business.\r\n\r\n“It is a most excellent charity,” said the Rev. Aubrey, edging past\r\nSoapy in spite of that sufferer’s feeble effort to block the way. “And I\r\nunderstand that several highly competent performers will appear on the\r\nplatform. I am right, am I not, officer?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, you are quite right. In the first part of the program\r\nConstable Purvis will render the ’Oly City--no, I’m a liar, Asleep on\r\nthe Deep; Constable Jukes will render imitations of well-known footlight\r\ncelebrities ’oo are familiartoyouall; Inspector Oakshott will render\r\nconjuring tricks; Constable----”\r\n\r\n“An excellent evening’s entertainment, in fact,” said the Rev. Aubrey.\r\n“I am taking the chair, I may mention.”\r\n\r\n“And the vicar is taking the chair,” said the policeman, swift to seize\r\nupon this added attraction. “So ’ow many of the five-shilling may I sell\r\nyou and your good lady, sir?”\r\n\r\nSoapy, like Chimp, was a thrifty man; and apart from the expense, his\r\nwhole soul shrank from doing anything even remotely calculated to\r\nencourage the force. Nevertheless, he perceived that there was no escape\r\nand decided that it remained only to save as much as possible from the\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\n“Gimme one,” he said, and the words seemed to be torn from him.\r\n\r\n“One only?” said the constable disappointedly. “’Ow about your good\r\nlady?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not married.”\r\n\r\n“’Ow about your sister?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t a sister.”\r\n\r\n“Then ’ow about if you ’appen to meet one of your gentlemen friends at\r\nthe club and he expresses a wish to come along?”\r\n\r\n“Gimme one!” said Soapy.\r\n\r\nThe policeman gave him one, received the money, returned a few genial\r\nwords of thanks and withdrew. Soapy, going back into the house, was\r\nacutely disturbed to find that the vicar had come too.\r\n\r\n“A most deserving charity,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\nSoapy eyed him bleakly. How did one get rid of vicars? Short of\r\nemploying his bride’s universal panacea and hauling off and busting him\r\none, Soapy could not imagine.\r\n\r\n“Have you been a resident of Valley Fields long, Mr. Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“I hope we shall see much of each other.”\r\n\r\n“Do you?” said Soapy wanly.\r\n\r\n“The first duty of a clergyman, in my opinion----”\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy had no notion of what constituted the first duty of a\r\nclergyman, and he was destined never to find out. For at this moment\r\nthere came from the regions above the clear, musical voice of a woman.\r\n\r\n“Sweet-ee!”\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy started violently. So did the Rev. Aubrey Jerningham.\r\n\r\n“I’m in the bedroom, honey bunch. Come right on up.”\r\n\r\nA dull flush reddened the Rev. Aubrey’s ascetic face.\r\n\r\n“I understood you to say that you were not married, Mr. Shotter,” he\r\nsaid in a metallic voice.\r\n\r\n“No--er--ah----”\r\n\r\nHe caught the Rev. Aubrey’s eye. He was looking as Sherlock Holmes might\r\nhave looked had he discovered Doctor Watson stealing his watch.\r\n\r\n“No--I--er--ah----”\r\n\r\nIt is not given to every man always to do the right thing in trying\r\ncircumstances. Mr. Molloy may be said at this point definitely to have\r\ncommitted a social blunder. Winking a hideous, distorted wink, he raised\r\nthe forefinger of his right hand and with a gruesome archness drove it\r\nsmartly in between his visitor’s third and fourth ribs.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, you know how it is,” he said thickly.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Aubrey Jerningham quivered from head to heel. He drew himself\r\nup and looked at Soapy. The finger had given him considerable physical\r\npain, but it was the spiritual anguish that hurt the more.\r\n\r\n“I do, indeed, know how it is,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Man of the world,” said Soapy, relieved.\r\n\r\n“I will wish you good evening, Mr. Shotter,” said the Rev. Aubrey.\r\n\r\nThe front door banged. Dolly appeared on the landing.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you come up?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Because I’m going to lie down,” said Soapy, breathing heavily.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I want a rest. I need a rest, and I’m going to have it.” Dolly\r\ndescended to the hall.\r\n\r\n“Why, you’re looking all in, precious!”\r\n\r\n“‘All in’ is right. If I don’t ease off for a coupla minutes, you’ll\r\nhave to send for an ambulance.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know as I won’t take a spell myself. It’s kinda dusty\r\nwork, hunting around. I’ll go take a breath of air outside at the\r\nback.... Was that somebody else calling just now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it was.”\r\n\r\n“Gee! These people round these parts don’t seem to have any homes of\r\ntheir own, do they? Well, I’ll be back in a moment, honey. There’s a\r\nsort of greenhouse place by the back door. Quite likely old Finglass may\r\nhave buried the stuff there.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Aubrey Jerningham crossed the little strip of gravel that\r\nserved both Mon Repos and San Rafael as a drive and mounted the steps\r\nto Mr. Wrenn’s front door. He was still quivering.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wrenn?” he asked of the well-dressed young man who answered the\r\nring.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock shook his head. This was the second time in the last five\r\nminutes that he had been taken for the owner of San Rafael; for while\r\nthe vicar had worked down Burberry Road from the top, the policeman had\r\nstarted at the bottom and worked up.\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” he said, “Mr. Wrenn’s out.”\r\n\r\n“I will come in and wait,” said the Rev. Aubrey.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely,” said Mr. Braddock.\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the drawing-room, feeling something of the\r\nembarrassment, though in a slighter degree, which this holy man had\r\ninspired in Soapy Molloy. He did not know much about vicars, and rather\r\nwondered how he was to keep the conversation going.\r\n\r\n“Offer you a cup of tea?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid,” said Mr. Braddock apologetically, “I don’t know where they\r\nkeep the whisky.”\r\n\r\n“I never touch spirits.”\r\n\r\nConversation languished. Willoughby Braddock began to find his companion\r\na little damping. Not matey. Seemed to be brooding on something, or Mr.\r\nBraddock was very much mistaken.\r\n\r\n“You’re a clergyman, aren’t you, and all that?” he said, after a pause\r\nof some moments.\r\n\r\n“I am. My name is the Rev. Aubrey Jerningham. I have just taken up my\r\nduties as vicar of this parish.”\r\n\r\n“Ah? Jolly spot.”\r\n\r\n“Where every prospect pleases,” said the Rev. Aubrey, “and only man is\r\nvile.”\r\n\r\nSilence fell once more. Mr. Braddock searched in his mind for genial\r\nchatter, and found that he was rather short on clerical small talk.\r\n\r\nHe thought for a moment of asking his visitor why it was that bishops\r\nwore those rummy bootlace-looking things on their hats--a problem that\r\nhad always perplexed him; but decided that the other might take offence\r\nat being urged to give away professional secrets.\r\n\r\n“How’s the choir coming along?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“The choir is quite satisfactory.”\r\n\r\n“That’s good. Organ all right?”\r\n\r\n“Quite, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Fine!” said Mr. Braddock, feeling that things were beginning to move.\r\n“You know, down where I live, in Wiltshire, the local padres always seem\r\nto have the deuce of a lot of trouble with their organs. Their church\r\norgans, I mean, of course. I’m always getting touched for contributions\r\nto organ funds. Why is that? I’ve often wondered.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Aubrey Jerningham forbore to follow him into this field of\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n“Then you do not live here, Mr.----”\r\n\r\n“Braddock’s my name--Willoughby Braddock. Oh, no, I don’t live here.\r\nJust calling. Friend of the family.”\r\n\r\n“Ah? Then you are not acquainted with the--gentleman who lives next\r\ndoor--Mr. Shotter?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I am! Sam Shotter? He’s one of my best pals. Known him for\r\nyears and years and years.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? I cannot compliment you upon your choice of associates.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s wrong with Sam?”\r\n\r\n“Only this, Mr. Braddock,” said the Rev. Aubrey, his suppressed wrath\r\nboiling over like a kettle: “He is living a life of open sin.”\r\n\r\n“Open which?”\r\n\r\n“Open sin. In the heart of my parish.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t get this. How do you mean--open sin?”\r\n\r\n“I have it from this man Shotter’s own lips that he is a bachelor.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s right.”\r\n\r\n“And yet a few minutes ago I called at his house and found that there\r\nwas a woman residing there.”\r\n\r\n“A woman?”\r\n\r\n“A woman.”\r\n\r\n“But there can’t be. Sam’s not that sort of chap. Did you see her?”\r\n\r\n“I did not wait to see her. I heard her voice.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got it,” said Mr. Braddock acutely. “She must have been a caller;\r\nsome casual popper-in, you know.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, what would she be doing in his bedroom?”\r\n\r\n“In his bedroom?”\r\n\r\n“In--his--bedroom! I came here to warn Mr. Wrenn, who, I understand from\r\nMr. Cornelius, has a young niece, to be most careful to allow nothing in\r\nthe shape of neighbourly relations between the two houses. Do you think\r\nthat Mr. Wrenn will be returning shortly?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t say. But look here,” said Mr. Braddock, troubled, “there\r\nmust be some mistake.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know where he is, by any chance?”\r\n\r\n“No--yes, I do, though. He said something about going to see Cornelius.\r\nI think they play chess together or something. A game,” said Mr.\r\nBraddock, “which I have never been able to get the hang of. But then I’m\r\nnot awfully good at those brainy games.”\r\n\r\n“I will go to Mr. Cornelius’ house,” said the Rev. Aubrey, rising.\r\n\r\n“You don’t play mah-jongg, do you?” asked Mr. Braddock. “Now, there’s a\r\ngame that I----”\r\n\r\n“If he is not there, I will return.”\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Willoughby Braddock found that his appetite for tea had\r\ndeserted him. Claire, grateful for his services, had rather extended\r\nherself over the buttered toast, but it had no appeal for him. He\r\nlighted a cigarette and went out to fiddle with the machinery of his\r\ntwo-seater, always an assistance to thought.\r\n\r\nBut even the carburettor, which had one of those fascinating ailments to\r\nwhich carburettors are subject, yielded him no balm. He was thoroughly\r\nupset and worried.\r\n\r\nHe climbed into the car and gave himself up to gloomy meditation, and\r\npresently voices down the road announced the return of Kay and Sam. They\r\nwere chatting away in the friendliest possible fashion--from where he\r\nsat, Willoughby Braddock could hear Kay’s clear laugh ringing out\r\nhappily--and it seemed to Mr. Braddock, though he was no austerer\r\nmoralist than the rest of his generation, that things were in a position\r\nonly to be described as a bit thick. He climbed down and waited on the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\n“Why, hullo, Willoughby,” said Kay. “This is fine. Have you just\r\narrived? Come in and have some tea.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve had tea, thanks. That girl Claire gave me some, thanks.... I say,\r\nSam, could I have a word with you?”\r\n\r\n“Say on,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“In private, I mean. You don’t mind, Kay?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit. I’ll go in and order tea.”\r\n\r\nKay disappeared into the house; and Sam, looking at Mr. Braddock,\r\nobserved with some surprise that his face had turned a vivid red and\r\nthat his eyes were fastened upon him in a reproachful stare.\r\n\r\n“What’s up?” he asked, concerned.\r\n\r\nWilloughby Braddock cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“You know, Sam----”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t,” said Sam, as he paused.\r\n\r\n“----you know, Sam, I’m not a--nobody would call me a---- Dash it, now\r\nI’ve forgotten the word!”\r\n\r\n“Beauty?” hazarded Sam.\r\n\r\n“It’s on the tip of my tongue--Puritan. That’s the word I want. I’m not\r\na Puritan. Not strait-laced, you know. But, really, honestly, Sam, old\r\nman--I mean, dash it all!”\r\n\r\nSam stroked his chin thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“I still don’t quite get it, Bradder,” he said. “What exactly is the\r\ntrouble?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean, on the premises, old boy, absolutely on the premises--is\r\nit playing the game? I mean, next door to people who are pals of mine\r\nand taking Kay to the theatre and generally going on as if nothing was\r\nwrong.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is wrong?” asked Sam patiently.\r\n\r\n“Well, when it comes to the vicar beetling in and complaining about\r\nwomen in your bedroom----”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“He said he heard her.”\r\n\r\n“Heard a woman in my bedroom?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“He must be crazy. When?”\r\n\r\n“Just now.”\r\n\r\n“This beats me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that was what he said, anyway. Dashed unpleasant he was about it\r\ntoo. Oh, and there’s another thing, Sam. I wish you’d ask that man of\r\nyours not to call me brother. He----”\r\n\r\n“Great Cæsar!” said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe took Willoughby Braddock by the arm and urged him toward the steps.\r\nHis face wore a purposeful look.\r\n\r\n“You go in, like a good chap, and talk to Kay,” he said. “Tell her I’ll\r\nbe in in a minute. There’s something I’ve got to look into.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but listen----”\r\n\r\n“Run along!”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“Push off!”\r\n\r\nYielding to superior force, Willoughby Braddock entered San Rafael,\r\nwalking pensively. And Sam, stepping off the gravel onto the grass,\r\nmoved with a stealthy tread toward his home. Vague but lively suspicions\r\nwere filling his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the foot of the steps and paused to listen, when the\r\nevening air was suddenly split by a sharp feminine scream. This was\r\nfollowed by a joyous barking. And this in its turn was followed by the\r\nabrupt appearance of a flying figure, racing toward the gate. It was\r\nmoving swiftly and the light was dim, but Sam had no difficulty in\r\nrecognising his old acquaintance Miss Gunn, of Pittsburgh. She fled\r\nrapidly through the gate and out into Burberry Road, while Amy, looking\r\nin the dusk like a small elephant, gambolled about her, uttering strange\r\ncanine noises. Dolly slammed the gate, but gates meant nothing to Amy.\r\nShe poured herself over it and the two passed into the darkness.\r\n\r\nSam’s jaw set grimly. He moved with noiseless steps to the door of Mon\r\nRepos and took out his key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\r\n\r\nMAINLY ABOUT TROUSERS\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe meeting between Amy and Mrs. Molloy had taken place owing to the\r\nresolve of the latter to search the small conservatory which stood\r\noutside the back door. She had told Soapy that she thought the missing\r\nbonds might be hidden there. They were not, but Amy was. The\r\nconservatory was a favourite sleeping porch of Amy’s, and thither she\r\nhad repaired on discovering that her frolicsome overtures to Hash had\r\nbeen taken in the wrong spirit.\r\n\r\nMrs. Molloy’s feelings, on groping about in the dark and suddenly poking\r\nher hand into the cavernous mouth of the largest dog she had ever\r\nencountered, have perhaps been sufficiently indicated by the description\r\nof her subsequent movements. Iron-nerved woman though she was, this was\r\ntoo much for her.\r\n\r\nThe single scream which she emitted, previous to saving her breath for\r\nthe race for life, penetrated only faintly to where Mr. Molloy sat\r\ntaking a rest on the sofa in the drawing-room. He heard it, but it had\r\nno message for him. He was feeling a little better now, and his\r\nganglions, though not having ceased to vibrate with uncomfortable\r\nrapidity, were beginning to simmer down. He decided that he would give\r\nhimself another couple of minutes of repose.\r\n\r\nIt was toward the middle of the second minute that the door opened\r\nquietly and Sam came in. He stood looking at the recumbent Mr. Molloy\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\n“Comfortable?” he said.\r\n\r\nSoapy shot off the sofa with a sort of gurgling whoop. Of all the\r\ndisturbing events of that afternoon, this one had got more surely in\r\namongst his nerve centres than any other. He had not heard the door\r\nopen, and Sam’s voice had been the first intimation that he was no\r\nlonger alone.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I startled you,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of a difficult profession had made Soapy Molloy a quick\r\nthinker. Frequently in the course of a busy life he had found himself in\r\npositions where a split second was all that was allowed him for forming\r\na complete plan of action. His trained mind answered to the present\r\nemergency like a machine.\r\n\r\n“You certainly did startle me,” he said bluffly, in his best Thomas G.\r\nGunn manner. “You startled the daylights out of me. So here you are at\r\nlast, Mr. Shotter.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, here I am.”\r\n\r\n“I have been waiting quite some little time. I’m afraid you caught me on\r\nthe point of going to sleep.”\r\n\r\nHe chuckled, as a man will when the laugh is on him.\r\n\r\n“I should imagine,” said Sam, “that it would take a smart man to catch\r\nyou asleep.”\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy chuckled again.\r\n\r\n“Just what the boys used to say of me in Denver City.” He paused and\r\nlooked at Sam a little anxiously. “Say, you do remember me, Mr.\r\nShotter?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly do.”\r\n\r\n“You remember my calling here the other day to see my old home?”\r\n\r\n“I remember you before that--when you were in Sing Sing.”\r\n\r\nHe turned away to light the gas, and Mr. Molloy was glad of the interval\r\nfor thought afforded by this action.\r\n\r\n“Sing Sing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You were never there.”\r\n\r\n“I went there to see a show, in which you took an important part. I\r\nforget what your number was.”\r\n\r\n“And what of it?”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy drew himself up with considerable dignity.\r\n\r\n“What of it?” he repeated. “What if I was for a brief period--owing to a\r\nprejudiced judge and a packed jury--in the place you mention? I decline\r\nto have the fact taken as a slur on my character. You are an American,\r\nMr. Shotter, and you know that there is unfortunately a dark side to\r\nAmerican politics. My fearless efforts on behalf of the party of reform\r\nand progress brought me into open hostility with a gang of unscrupulous\r\nmen, who did not hesitate to have me arrested on a trumped-up charge\r\nand----”\r\n\r\n“All this,” said Sam, “would go a lot stronger with me if I hadn’t found\r\nyou burgling my house.”\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult to say whether the expression that swept\r\nover Mr. Molloy’s fine face was more largely indignation or amazement.\r\n\r\n“Burgling your house? Are you insane? I called here in the hope of\r\nseeing you, was informed that you were not at home, and was invited by\r\nyour manservant, a most civil fellow, to await your return. Burgling\r\nyour house, indeed! If I were, would you have found me lying on the\r\nsofa?”\r\n\r\n“Hash let you in?”\r\n\r\nSuch was the magnetic quality of the personality of one who had often\r\nsold large blocks of shares in nonexistent oil wells to Scotchmen, that\r\nSam was beginning in spite of himself to be doubtful.\r\n\r\n“If Hash is the name of your manservant, most certainly he let me in. He\r\nadmitted me by the front door in the perfectly normal and conventional\r\nmanner customary when gentlemen pay calls.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Hash?”\r\n\r\n“Why ask me?”\r\n\r\nSam went to the door. The generous indignation of his visitor had caused\r\nhim to waver, but it had not altogether convinced him.\r\n\r\n“Hash!” he called.\r\n\r\n“He appears to be out.”\r\n\r\n“Hash!”\r\n\r\n“Gone for a walk, no doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Hash!” shouted Sam.\r\n\r\nFrom the regions below there came an answering cry.\r\n\r\n“Hi! Help!”\r\n\r\nIt had been a long and arduous task for Hash Todhunter to expel from his\r\nmouth the duster which Soapy Molloy had rammed into it with such\r\nearnest care, but he had accomplished it at last, and his voice sounded\r\nto Mr. Molloy like a knell.\r\n\r\n“He appears to be in, after all,” he said feebly.\r\n\r\nSam had turned and was regarding him fixedly, and Soapy noted with a\r\nsinking heart the athletic set of his shoulders and the large\r\nmuscularity of his hands. “Haul off and bust him one!” his wife’s gentle\r\nvoice seemed to whisper in his ear; but eying Sam, he knew that any such\r\nproject was but a Utopian dream. Sam had the unmistakable look of one\r\nwho, if busted, would infallibly bust in return and bust\r\ndisintegratingly.\r\n\r\n“You tied him up, I suppose,” said Sam, with a menacing calm.\r\n\r\nSoapy said nothing. There is a time for words and a time for silence.\r\n\r\nSam looked at him in some perplexity. He had begun to see that he was\r\nfaced with the rather delicate problem of how to be in two places at the\r\nsame time. He must, of course, at once go down to the kitchen and\r\nrelease Hash. But if he did that, would not this marauder immediately\r\nescape by the front door? And if he took him down with him to the\r\nkitchen, the probability was that he would escape by the back door.\r\nWhile if he merely left him in this room and locked the door, he would\r\nproceed at once to depart by the window.\r\n\r\nIt was a nice problem, but all problems are capable of solution. Sam\r\nsolved this one in a spasm of pure inspiration. He pointed a menacing\r\nfinger at Soapy.\r\n\r\n“Take off those trousers!” he said.\r\n\r\nSoapy gaped. The intellectual pressure of the conversation had become\r\ntoo much for him.\r\n\r\n“Trousers?” he faltered.\r\n\r\n“Trousers. You know perfectly well what trousers are,” said Sam, “and\r\nit’s no good pretending you don’t. Take them off!”\r\n\r\n“Take off my trousers?”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” said Sam with sudden petulance. “What’s the matter with the\r\nman. You do it every night, don’t you? You do it when you take a Turkish\r\nbath, don’t you? Where’s the difficulty? Peel them off and don’t waste\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“But----”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” said Sam. “If those trousers are not delivered to me f. o. b.\r\nin thirty seconds, I’ll bust you one!”\r\n\r\nHe had them in eighteen.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Sam, “I think you’ll find it a little difficult to get\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nHe gathered up the garments, draped them over his arm and went down to\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nLove is the master passion. It had come to Hash Todhunter late, but,\r\nlike measles, the more violent for the delay. A natural inclination to\r\ngo upstairs and rend his recent aggressor limb from limb faded before\r\nthe more imperious urge to dash across to San Rafael and see Claire. It\r\nwas the first thing of which he spoke when Sam, with the aid of a\r\ncarving knife, had cut his bonds.\r\n\r\n“I got to see ’er!”\r\n\r\n“Are you hurt, Hash?”\r\n\r\n“No, ’e only ’it me on the ’ead. I got to see ’er, Sam.”\r\n\r\n“Claire?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! The pore little angel, crying ’er ruddy eyes out. The gentleman was\r\nsaying all about it.”\r\n\r\n“What gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“A gentleman come to the back door and told that perisher all about how\r\nthe pore little thing was howling and weeping and all, thinking ’e was\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Have you had a quarrel with Claire?”\r\n\r\n“We ’ad words. I got to see ’er.”\r\n\r\n“You shall. Can you walk?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I can walk. Why shouldn’t I walk?”\r\n\r\n“Come along then.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his assurance, however, Hash found his cramped limbs hard to\r\nsteer. Sam had to lend an arm, and their progress was slow.\r\n\r\n“Sam,” said Hash, after a pause which had been intended primarily for\r\nmassage, but which had plainly been accompanied by thought, “do you know\r\nanything about getting married?”\r\n\r\n“Only that it is an excellent thing to do.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, ’ow quick can a feller get married?”\r\n\r\n“Like a flash, I believe. At any rate, if he goes to a registrar’s.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to a registrar’s then. I’ve ’ad enough of these what I might\r\ncall misunderstandings.”\r\n\r\n“Brave words, Hash! How are the legs?”\r\n\r\n“The legs are all right. It’s her mother I’m thinking of.”\r\n\r\n“You always seem to be thinking of her mother. Are you quite sure\r\nyou’ve picked the right one of the family?”\r\n\r\nHash had halted again, and his face was that of a man whose soul was a\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\n“Sam, ’er mother wants to come and live with us when we’re married.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why not?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you ain’t seen her, Sam! She’s got a hooked nose and an eye like\r\none of these animal trainers. Still----”\r\n\r\nThe battle appeared to be resumed once more.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well!” said Hash. He mused for a while. “You’ve got to look at it\r\nall round, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“And there’s this to think of: She says she’ll buy a pub for us.”\r\n\r\n“Pubs are pubs,” agreed Sam.\r\n\r\n“I’ve always wanted to have a pub of my own.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shouldn’t hesitate.”\r\n\r\nHash suddenly saw the poetic side of the vision.\r\n\r\n“Won’t my little Clara look a treat standing behind a bar, serving the\r\ndrinks and singing out, ‘Time, gentlemen, please!’ Can’t you see her\r\nscraping the froth off the mugs?”\r\n\r\nHe fell into a rapt silence, and said no more while Sam escorted him\r\nthrough the back door of San Rafael and led him into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThere, rightly considering that the sacred scene of re-union was not for\r\nhis eyes, Sam turned away. Gently depositing the nether garments of Mr.\r\nMolloy on the table, he left them together and made his way to the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThe first thing he heard as he opened the door was Kay’s voice.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” she was saying. “I simply don’t believe it.”\r\n\r\nHe went in and discovered that she was addressing her uncle, Mr. Wrenn,\r\nand the white-bearded Mr. Cornelius. They were standing together by the\r\nmantelpiece, their attitude the sheepish and browbeaten one of men who\r\nhave been rash enough to argue with a woman. Mr. Wrenn was fiddling with\r\nhis tie, and Mr. Cornelius looked like a druid who is having a little\r\nunpleasantness with the widow of the deceased.\r\n\r\nSam’s entrance was the signal for an awkward silence.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Mr. Wrenn,” said Sam. “Good evening, Mr. Cornelius.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wrenn looked at Mr. Cornelius. Mr. Cornelius looked at Mr. Wrenn.\r\n\r\n“Say something,” said Mr. Cornelius’ eye to Mr. Wrenn. “You are her\r\nuncle.”\r\n\r\n“You say something,” retorted Mr. Wrenn’s eye to Mr. Cornelius. “You\r\nhave a white beard.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry I’ve been such a time,” said Sam to Kay. “I have had a little\r\ndomestic trouble. I found a gentleman burgling my house.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“There had been a lady there, too, but she was leaving as I arrived.”\r\n\r\n“A lady!”\r\n\r\n“Well, let us call her a young female party.”\r\n\r\nKay swung round on Mr. Wrenn, her eyes gleaming with the light that\r\nshines only in the eyes of girls who are entitled to say “I told you\r\nso!” to elderly relatives. Mr. Wrenn avoided her gaze. Mr. Cornelius\r\nplucked at his beard and registered astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Burgling your house? What for?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what’s puzzling me. These two people seem extraordinarily\r\ninterested in Mon Repos. They called some days ago and wanted to buy the\r\nplace, and now I find them burgling it.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” cried Mr. Cornelius. “I wonder! Can it be possible?”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t wonder. It might,” said Sam. “What?”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember my telling you, Mr. Shotter, when you came to me about\r\nthe lease of the house that a well-known criminal had once lived there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“A man named Finglass. Do you remember Finglass, Wrenn?”\r\n\r\n“No; he must have been before my time.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you been here?”\r\n\r\n“About three years and a half.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then it was before your time. This man robbed the New Asiatic Bank\r\nof something like four hundred thousand pounds’ worth of securities. He\r\nwas never caught, and presumably fled the country. You will find the\r\nwhole story in my history of Valley Fields. Can it be possible that\r\nFinglass hid the bonds in Mon Repos and was unable to get back there and\r\nremove them?”\r\n\r\n“You said it!” cried Sam enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“It would account for the anxiety of these people to obtain access to\r\nthe house.”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course!” said Kay.\r\n\r\n“It sounds extremely likely,” said Mr. Wrenn.\r\n\r\n“Was the man tall and thin, with a strong cast in the left eye?”\r\n\r\n“No; a square-faced sort of fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Then it would not be Finglass himself. No doubt some other criminal,\r\nsome associate of his, who had learned from him that the bonds were\r\nhidden in the house. I wish I had my history here,” said Mr. Cornelius.\r\n“Several pages of it are devoted to Finglass.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what,” said Sam, “go and get it.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, do.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Will you come with me, Wrenn?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly he will,” said Sam warmly. “Mr. Wrenn would like a breath of\r\nfresh air.”\r\n\r\nWith considerable satisfaction he heard the front door close on the\r\nnon-essential members of the party.\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinary thing!” said Kay.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sam, drawing his chair closer. “The aspect of the affair\r\nthat strikes me----”\r\n\r\n“What became of the man?”\r\n\r\n“He’s all right. I left him in the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\n“But he’ll escape.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he won’t.”\r\n\r\n“But all he’s got to do is walk out of the door.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but he won’t do it.” Sam drew his chair still closer. “I was\r\nsaying that the aspect of the affair that strikes me most forcibly is\r\nthat now I shall be in a position to marry and do it properly.”\r\n\r\n“Are you thinking of marrying someone?”\r\n\r\n“I think of nothing else. Well, now, to look into this. The bank will\r\nprobably give a ten per cent reward for the return of the stuff. Even\r\nfive per cent would be a nice little sum. That fixes the financial end\r\nof the thing. So now----”\r\n\r\n“You seem very certain that you will find this money.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I shall find it, have no fear. If it’s there----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but perhaps it isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I feel sure that it is. So now let’s make our plans. We will buy a farm\r\nsomewhere, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“I have no objection to your buying a farm.”\r\n\r\n“I said we. We will buy a farm, and there settle down and live to a ripe\r\nold age on milk, honey and the produce of the soil. You will wear a\r\ngingham gown, I shall grow a beard. We will keep dogs, pigeons, cats,\r\nsheep, fowls, horses, cows, and a tortoise to keep in the garden. Good\r\nfor the snails,” explained Sam.\r\n\r\n“Bad for them, I should think. Are you fond of tortoises?”\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Not very.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Sam magnanimously, “we will waive the tortoise.”\r\n\r\n“It sounds like a forgotten sport of the past--Waving the Tortoise.”\r\n\r\n“To resume. We decide on the farm. Right! Now where is it to be? You are\r\na Wiltshire girl, so no doubt will prefer that county. I can’t afford\r\nto buy back Midways for you, I’m afraid, unless on second thoughts I\r\ndecide to stick to the entire proceeds instead of handing them back to\r\nthe bank--we shall have to talk that over later--but isn’t there some\r\nold greystone, honeysuckle-covered place in the famous Braddock\r\nestates?”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“You said you had left that man in your drawing-room.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve suddenly remembered that I sent Willoughby over to Mon Repos ten\r\nminutes ago to find out why you were so long. He’s probably being\r\nmurdered.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I shouldn’t think so. To go back to what I was saying----”\r\n\r\n“You must go and see at once.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really think it’s necessary?”\r\n\r\n“Of course it is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well.”\r\n\r\nSam rose reluctantly. Life, he felt with considerable peevishness, was\r\none long round of interruptions. He went round to the door of Mon Repos\r\nand let himself in with his key. A rumble of voices proceeding from the\r\ndrawing-room greeted him as he entered. He banged the door, and a moment\r\nlater Mr. Braddock came out, looking a little flustered.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there you are, Sam! I was just coming round to fetch you.”\r\n\r\n“Anything wrong?”\r\n\r\n“It depends on what you call wrong.” Mr. Braddock closed the\r\ndrawing-room door carefully. “You know Lord Tilbury?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I know Lord Tilbury.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he’s in there,” said Willoughby Braddock, jerking an awed thumb\r\ntoward the drawing-room, “and he hasn’t got any trousers on.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\r\n\r\nSAM HEARS BAD NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nSam uttered a cry of exceeding bitterness. Nothing is more galling to\r\nyour strategist than to find that some small, unforeseen accident has\r\noccurred and undone all his schemes. The one thing for which he had\r\nomitted to allow was the possibility of some trousered caller wandering\r\nin during his absence and supplying Mr. Molloy with the means of escape.\r\n\r\n“So he’s gone, I suppose?” he said morosely.\r\n\r\n“No, he’s still here,” said Mr. Braddock. “In the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\n“The man, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“What man?”\r\n\r\n“The other man.”\r\n\r\n“What other man?” asked Mr. Braddock, whose exacting afternoon had begun\r\nto sap his mental powers.\r\n\r\n“Oh, never mind,” said Sam impatiently. “What did Lord Tilbury want,\r\ncoming down here, confound him?”\r\n\r\n“Came to see you about something, I should think,” surmised Mr.\r\nBraddock.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t he tell you what it was?”\r\n\r\n“No. As a matter of fact, we’ve been chatting mostly about trousers. You\r\nhaven’t got a spare pair in the house by any chance, have you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I have--upstairs.”\r\n\r\n“Then I wish,” said Mr. Braddock earnestly, “that you would dig them out\r\nand give them to the old boy. He’s been trying for the last ten minutes\r\nto get me to lend him mine, and it simply can’t be done. I’ve got to be\r\ngetting back to town soon to dress for dinner, and you can say what you\r\nlike, a fellow buzzing along in a two-seater without any trousers on\r\nlooks conspicuous.”\r\n\r\n“Darn that fool, coming down here at just this time!” said Sam, still\r\naggrieved. “What exactly happened?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he’s a bit on the incoherent side; but as far as I can make out,\r\nthat man of yours, the chap who called me brother, seems to have gone\r\ncompletely off his onion. Old Tilbury rang the front doorbell, and there\r\nwas a bit of a pause, and then this chap opened the door and old Tilbury\r\nwent in, and then he happened to look at him and saw that he hadn’t any\r\ntrousers on.”\r\n\r\n“That struck him as strange, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Apparently he hadn’t much time to think about it, for the bloke\r\nimmediately proceeded to hold him up with a gun.”\r\n\r\n“He hadn’t got a gun.”\r\n\r\n“Well, old Tilbury asserts that he was shoving something against his\r\npocket from inside.”\r\n\r\n“His finger, or a pipe.”\r\n\r\n“No, I say, really!” Mr. Braddock’s voice betrayed the utmost\r\nastonishment and admiration. “Would that be it? I call that clever.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he hadn’t a gun when I caught him or he would have used it on me.\r\nWhat happened then?”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean--caught him?”\r\n\r\n“I found him burgling the house.”\r\n\r\n“Was that chap who called me brother a burglar?” cried Mr. Braddock,\r\namazed. “I thought he was your man.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he wasn’t. What happened next?”\r\n\r\n“The bloke proceeded to de-bag old Tilbury. Then shoving on the\r\ntrousers, he started to leg it. Old Tilbury at this juncture appears to\r\nhave said ‘Hi! What about me?’ or words to that effect; upon which the\r\nbloke replied, ‘Use your own judgment!’ and passed into the night. When\r\nI came in, old Tilbury was in the drawing-room, wearing the evening\r\npaper as a sort of kilt and not looking too dashed pleased with things\r\nin general.”\r\n\r\n“Well, come along and see him.”\r\n\r\n“Not me,” said Mr. Braddock. “I’ve had ten minutes of him and it has\r\nsufficed. Also, I’ve got to be buzzing up to town. I’m dining out.\r\nBesides, it’s you he wants to see, not me.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what he wants to see me about.”\r\n\r\n“Must be something important to bring him charging down here. Well, I’ll\r\nbe moving, old boy. Mustn’t keep you. Thanks for a very pleasant\r\nafternoon.”\r\n\r\nWilloughby Braddock took his departure; and Sam, having gone to his\r\nbedroom and found a pair of grey flannel trousers, returned to the lower\r\nregions and went into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had not expected to find his visitor in anything approaching a mood\r\nof sunniness, but he was unprepared for the red glare of hate and\r\nhostility in the eyes which seared their way through him as he entered.\r\nIt almost seemed as if Lord Tilbury imagined the distressing happenings\r\nof the last quarter of an hour to be Sam’s fault.\r\n\r\n“So there you are!” said Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\nHe had been standing with an air of coyness behind the sofa; but now, as\r\nhe observed the trousers over Sam’s arm, he swooped forward feverishly\r\nand wrenched them from him. He pulled them on, muttering thickly to\r\nhimself; and this done, drew himself up and glared at his host once more\r\nwith that same militant expression of loathing in his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe seemed keenly alive to the fact that he was not looking his best. Sam\r\nwas a long-legged man, and in the case of Lord Tilbury, Nature, having\r\nequipped him with an outsize in brains, had not bothered much about his\r\nlower limbs. The borrowed trousers fell in loose folds about his ankles,\r\nbrushing the floor. Nor did they harmonise very satisfactorily with the\r\nupper portion of a morning suit. Seeing him, Sam could not check a faint\r\nsmile of appreciation.\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury saw the smile, and it had the effect of increasing his fury\r\nto the point where bubbling rage becomes a sort of frozen calm.\r\n\r\n“You are amused,” he said tensely.\r\n\r\nSam repudiated the dreadful charge.\r\n\r\n“No, no! Just thinking of something.”\r\n\r\n“Cor!” said Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\nSam perceived that a frank and soothing explanation must be his first\r\nstep. After that, and only after that, could he begin to institute\r\ninquiries as to why His Lordship had honoured him with this visit.\r\n\r\n“That fellow who stole your trousers----”\r\n\r\n“I have no wish to discuss him,” said Lord Tilbury with hauteur. “The\r\nfact that you employ a lunatic manservant causes me no surprise.”\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t my manservant. He was a burglar.”\r\n\r\n“A burglar? Roaming at large about the house? Did you know he was here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. I caught him and I made him take his trousers off, and then I\r\nwent next door to tea.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury expelled a long breath.\r\n\r\n“Indeed? You went next door to tea?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Leaving this--this criminal----”\r\n\r\n“Well, I knew he couldn’t get away. Oh, I had reasoned it all out. Your\r\nhappening to turn up was just a bit of bad luck. Was there anything you\r\nwanted to see me about?” asked Sam, feeling that the sooner this\r\ninterview terminated the pleasanter it would be.\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury puffed out his cheeks and stood smouldering for a moment.\r\nIn the agitation of the recent occurrences, he had almost forgotten the\r\ntragedy which had sent him hurrying down to Mon Repos.\r\n\r\n“Yes, there was,” he said. He sizzled for another brief instant. “I may\r\nbegin by telling you,” he said, “that your uncle, Mr. Pynsent, when he\r\nsent you over here to join my staff, practically placed me _in loco\r\nparentis_ with respect to you.”\r\n\r\n“An excellent idea,” said Sam courteously.\r\n\r\n“An abominable idea! It was an iniquitous thing to demand of a busy man\r\nthat he should take charge of a person of a character so erratic, so\r\nundisciplined, so--er--eccentric as to border closely upon the insane.”\r\n\r\n“Insane?” said Sam. He was wounded to the quick by the injustice of\r\nthese harsh words. From first to last, he could think of no action of\r\nhis that had not been inspired and guided throughout by the dictates of\r\npure reason. “Who, me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you! It was a monstrous responsibility to give any man, and I\r\nconsented to undertake it only because--er----”\r\n\r\n“I know. My uncle told me,” said Sam, to help him out. “You had some\r\nbusiness deal on, and you wanted to keep in with him.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury showed no gratitude for this kindly prompting.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said bitterly, “it may interest you to know that the deal to\r\nwhich you refer has fallen through.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that,” said Sam sympathetically. “That’s tough\r\nluck. I’m afraid my uncle is a queer sort of fellow to do business\r\nwith.”\r\n\r\n“I received a cable from him this afternoon, informing me that he had\r\nchanged his mind and would be unable to meet me in the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Too bad,” said Sam. “I really am sorry.”\r\n\r\n“And it is entirely owing to you, you may be pleased to learn.”\r\n\r\n“Me? Why, what have I done?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you what you have done. Mr. Pynsent’s cable was in answer\r\nto one from me, in which I informed him that you were in the process of\r\nbecoming entangled with a girl.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“You need not trouble to deny it. I saw you with my own eyes lunching\r\ntogether at the Savoy, and I happen to know that this afternoon you took\r\nher to the theatre.”\r\n\r\nSam looked at him dizzily.\r\n\r\n“You aren’t--you can’t by any chance be referring to Miss Derrick?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I am referring to Miss Derrick.”\r\n\r\nSo stupendous was Sam’s amazement that anybody could describe what was\r\nprobably the world’s greatest and most beautiful romance as “becoming\r\nentangled with a girl” that he could only gape.\r\n\r\n“I cabled to Mr. Pynsent, informing him of the circumstances and asking\r\nfor instructions.”\r\n\r\n“You did what?” Sam’s stupor of astonishment had passed away, whirled to\r\nthe four winds on a tempestuous rush of homicidal fury. “You mean to\r\ntell me that you had the--the nerve--the insolence----” He gulped. Being\r\na young man usually quick to express his rare bursts of anger in terms\r\nof action, he looked longingly at Lord Tilbury, regretting that the\r\nlatter’s age and physique disqualified him as a candidate for assault\r\nand battery. “Do you mean to tell me----” He swallowed rapidly. The\r\nthought of this awful little man spying upon Kay and smirching her with\r\nhis loathly innuendoes made mere words inadequate.\r\n\r\n“I informed Mr. Pynsent that you were conducting a clandestine love\r\naffair and asked him what I was to do.”\r\n\r\nTo Sam, like some blessed inspiration, there came a memory of a scene\r\nthat had occurred in his presence abaft the fiddley of the tramp steamer\r\n_Araminta_ when that vessel was two days out of New York. A dreamy\r\nable-bodied seaman, thoughts of home or beer having temporarily taken\r\nhis mind off his job, had chanced to wander backward onto the foot of\r\nthe bos’n while the latter was crossing the deck with a full pot of\r\npaint in his hands. And the bos’n, recovering his breath, had condensed\r\nhis feelings into two epithets so elastic and comprehensive that, while\r\nthey were an exact description of the able-bodied seaman, they applied\r\nequally well to Lord Tilbury. Indeed, it seemed to Sam that they might\r\nhave been invented expressly for Lord Tilbury’s benefit.\r\n\r\nA moment before he had been deploring the inadequacy of mere words. But\r\nthese were not mere words. They were verbal dynamite.\r\n\r\n“You so-and-so!” said Sam. “You such-and-such!”\r\n\r\nSailors are toughened by early training and long usage to bear\r\nthemselves phlegmatically beneath abuse. Lord Tilbury had had no such\r\nadvantages. He sprang backward as if he had been scalded by a sudden jet\r\nof boiling water.\r\n\r\n“You pernicious little bounder!” said Sam. He strode to the door and\r\nflung it open. “Get out!”\r\n\r\nIf ever there was an occasion on which a man might excusably have said\r\n“Sir!” this was it; and no doubt, had he been able to speak, this was\r\nthe word which Lord Tilbury would have used. Nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury had passed since he had been addressed in this fashion to his\r\nface, and the thing staggered him.\r\n\r\n“Get out!” repeated Sam. “What the devil,” he inquired peevishly, “are\r\nyou doing here, poisoning the air?”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury felt no inclination to embark upon a battle of words in\r\nwhich he appeared to be in opposition to an expert. Dazedly he flapped\r\nout into the hall, the grey flannel trousers swirling about his feet. At\r\nthe front door, however, it suddenly occurred to him that he had not yet\r\nfired the most important shell in his ammunition wagon. He turned at\r\nbay.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” he cried. “I may add----”\r\n\r\n“No, you mayn’t,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“I wish to add----”\r\n\r\n“Keep moving!”\r\n\r\n“I insist on informing you,” shouted Lord Tilbury, plucking at the\r\ntrousers with a nautical twitch, “of this one thing: Your uncle said in\r\nhis cable that you were to take the next boat back to America.”\r\n\r\nIt had not been Sam’s intention to permit anything to shake the stern\r\nsteeliness of his attitude, but this information did it. He stopped\r\nmidway in an offensive sniff designed to afford a picturesque\r\nillustration of his view on the other’s air-poisoning qualities and\r\ngazed at him blankly.\r\n\r\n“Did he say that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he did.” Sam scratched his chin thoughtfully. Lord Tilbury began\r\nto feel a little better. “And,” he continued, “as I should imagine that\r\na young man of your intellectual attainments has little scope for making\r\na living except by sponging on his rich relatives, I presume that you\r\nwill accede to his wishes. In case you may still suppose that you are a\r\nmember of the staff of Tilbury House, I will disabuse you of that view.\r\nYou are not.”\r\n\r\nSam remained silent; and Lord Tilbury, expanding and beginning to\r\nrealise that there is nothing unpleasant about a battle of words\r\nprovided that the battling is done in the right quarter, proceeded.\r\n\r\n“I only engaged you as a favour to your uncle. On your merits you could\r\nnot have entered Tilbury House as an office boy. I say,” he repeated in\r\na louder voice, “that, had there been no question of obliging Mr.\r\nPynsent, I would not have engaged you as an office boy.”\r\n\r\nSam came out of his trance.\r\n\r\n“Are you still here?” he said, annoyed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am still here. And let me tell you----”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” said Sam. “If you aren’t out of this house in two seconds,\r\nI’ll take those trousers back.”\r\n\r\nEvery Achilles has his heel. Of all the possible threats that Sam could\r\nhave used, this was probably the only one to which Lord Tilbury, in his\r\ndangerously elevated and hostile frame of mind, would have paid heed.\r\nFor one moment he stood swelling like a toy balloon, then he slid out\r\nand the door banged behind him.\r\n\r\nA dark shape loomed up before Lord Tilbury as he stood upon the gravel\r\noutside the portal of Mon Repos. Beside this shape there frolicked\r\nanother and a darker one.\r\n\r\n“’Evening, sir.”\r\n\r\nLord Tilbury perceived through the gloom that he was being addressed by\r\na member of the force. He made no reply. He was not in the mood for\r\nconversation with policemen.\r\n\r\n“Bringing your dog back,” said the officer genially. “Found ’er roaming\r\nabout at the top of the street.”\r\n\r\n“It is not my dog,” said Lord Tilbury between set teeth, repelling Amy\r\nas she endeavoured in her affable way to climb on to his neck.\r\n\r\n“Not a member of the ’ousehold, sir? Just a neighbour making a friendly\r\ncall? I see. Now I wonder,” said the policeman, “if any of my mates ’ave\r\napproached you on the matter of this concert in aid of a\r\ncharitubulorganisation which is not only most deserving in itself but is\r\nconnected with a body of men to ’oom you as a nouse’older will----”\r\n\r\n“G-r-r-h!” said Lord Tilbury.\r\n\r\nHe bounded out of the gate. Dimly, as he waddled down Burberry Road, the\r\ngrey flannel trousers brushing the pavement with a musical swishing\r\nsound, there came to him, faint but pursuing, the voice of the\r\nindefatigable policeman:\r\n\r\n“This charitubulorganisationtowhichIallude----”\r\n\r\nOut of the night, sent from heaven, there came a crawling taxicab. Lord\r\nTilbury poured himself in and sank back on the seat, a spent force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\r\n\r\nSAM HEARS GOOD NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nKay came out into the garden of San Rafael. Darkness had fallen now, and\r\nthe world was full of the sweet, wet scents of an autumn night. She\r\nstood still for a moment, sniffing, and a little pang of home-sickness\r\nshot through her. The garden smelled just like Midways. This was how she\r\nalways remembered Midways most vividly, with the shadows cloaking the\r\nflower beds, the trees dripping and the good earth sending up its\r\nincense to a starlit sky.\r\n\r\nWhen she shut her eyes she could almost imagine that she was back there.\r\nThen somebody began to whistle in the road and a train clanked into the\r\nstation and the vision faded.\r\n\r\nA faint odour of burning tobacco came to her, and on the lawn next door\r\nshe saw the glow of a pipe.\r\n\r\n“Sam!” she called.\r\n\r\nHis footsteps crunched on the gravel and he joined her at the fence.\r\n\r\n“You’re a nice sort of person, aren’t you?” said Kay. “Why didn’t you\r\ncome back?”\r\n\r\n“I had one or two things to think about.”\r\n\r\n“Willoughby dashed in for a minute and told me an incoherent story. So\r\nthe man got away?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Lord Tilbury!” said Kay, with a sudden silvery little bubble of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nSam said nothing.\r\n\r\n“What did he want, by the way?”\r\n\r\n“He came to tell me that he had had a cable from my uncle saying that I\r\nwas to go back at once.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Kay with a little gasp, and there was silence. “Go back--to\r\nAmerica?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“At once?”\r\n\r\n“Wednesday’s boat, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Not this very next Wednesday?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThere was another silence. The night was as still as if the clock had\r\nslipped back and Valley Fields had become the remote country spot of two\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\n“Are you going?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so.”\r\n\r\nFrom far away, out in the darkness, came the faint grunting of a train\r\nas it climbed the steep gradient of Sydenham Hill. An odd forlorn\r\nfeeling swept over Kay.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose you must,” she said. “You can’t afford to offend your\r\nuncle, can you?”\r\n\r\nSam moved restlessly, and there was a tiny rasping sound as his hand\r\nscraped along the fence.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t that,” he said.\r\n\r\n“But your uncle’s very rich, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“What does that matter?” Sam’s voice shook. “Lord Tilbury was good\r\nenough to inform me that my only way of making a living was to sponge on\r\nmy uncle, but I’m not going to have you thinking it.”\r\n\r\n“But--well, why are you going then?”\r\n\r\nSam choked.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you why I’m going. Simply because I might as well be in New\r\nYork as anywhere. If there was the slightest hope that by staying on\r\nhere I could get you to--to marry me----” His hand rasped on the fence\r\nagain. “Of course, I know there isn’t. I know you don’t take me\r\nseriously. I haven’t any illusions about myself. I know just what I\r\namount to in your eyes. I’m the fellow who blunders about and trips over\r\nhimself and is rather amusing when you’re in the mood. But I don’t\r\ncount. I don’t amount to anything.” Kay stirred in the darkness, but she\r\ndid not speak. “You think I’m kidding all the time. Well, I just want\r\nyou to know this--that I’m not kidding about the way I feel about you. I\r\nused to dream over that photograph before I’d ever met you. And when I\r\nmet you I knew one thing for certain, and that was there wasn’t ever\r\ngoing to be anyone except you ever. I know you don’t care about me and\r\nnever will. Why should you? What on earth is there about me that could\r\nmake you? I’m just a----”\r\n\r\nA little ripple of laughter came from the shadows.\r\n\r\n“Poor old Sam!” said Kay.\r\n\r\n“Yes! There you are--in a nutshell! Poor old Sam!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry I laughed. But it was so funny to hear you denouncing\r\nyourself in that grand way.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! Funny!”\r\n\r\n“Well, what’s wrong with being funny? I like funny people. I’d no notion\r\nyou had such hidden depths, Sam. Though, of course, the palmist said\r\nyou had, didn’t she?”\r\n\r\nThe train had climbed the hill and was now rumbling off into the\r\ndistance. A smell of burning leaves came floating over the gardens.\r\n\r\n“I don’t blame you for laughing,” said Sam. “Pray laugh if you wish to.”\r\n\r\nKay availed herself of the permission.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Sam, you are a pompous old ass, aren’t you? ‘Pray laugh if you wish\r\nto’!... Sam!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean that you would stay on in England if I promised to\r\nmarry you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And offend your rich uncle for life and get cut off with a dollar or\r\nwhatever they cut nephews off with in America?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nKay reached up at Sam’s head and gave his hair a little proprietorial\r\ntug.\r\n\r\n“Well, why don’t you, Sambo?” she said softly.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Sam that in some strange way his powers of breathing had\r\nbecome temporarily suspended. A curious dry feeling had invaded his\r\nthroat. He could hear his heart thumping.\r\n\r\n“What?” he croaked huskily.\r\n\r\n“I said why--do--you--not, Samivel?” whispered Kay, punctuating the\r\nwords with little tugs.\r\n\r\nSam found himself on the other side of the fence. How he had got there\r\nhe did not know. Presumably he had scrambled over. A much abraded shin\r\nbone was to show him later that this theory was the correct one, but at\r\nthe moment bruised shins had no meaning for him. He stood churning the\r\nmould of the flower bed on which he had alighted, staring at the\r\nindistinct whiteness which was Kay.\r\n\r\n“But look here,” said Sam thickly. “But look here----” A bird stirred\r\nsleepily in the tree.\r\n\r\n“But look here----”\r\n\r\nAnd then somehow--things were happening mysteriously to-night, and\r\napparently of their own volition--he found that Kay was in his arms. It\r\nseemed to him also, though his faculties were greatly clouded, that he\r\nwas kissing Kay.\r\n\r\n“But look here----” he said thickly. They were now, in some peculiar\r\nmanner, walking together up the gravel path, and he, unless his senses\r\ndeceived him, was holding her hand tucked very tightly under his arm. At\r\nleast, somebody, at whom he seemed to be looking from a long distance,\r\nwas doing this. This individual, who appeared to be in a confused frame\r\nof mind, was holding that hand with a sort of frenzied determination, as\r\nif he were afraid she might get away from him. “But look here, this\r\nisn’t possible!”\r\n\r\n“What isn’t possible?”\r\n\r\n“All this. A girl like you--a wonderful, splendid, marvellous girl like\r\nyou can’t possibly love”--the word seemed to hold all the magic of all\r\nthe magicians, and he repeated it dazedly--“love--love--can’t possibly\r\nlove a fellow like me.” He paused, finding the wonder of the thing\r\noppressive. “It--it doesn’t make sense.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Well, a fellow--a man--a fellow--oh, I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nKay chuckled. It came upon Sam with an overwhelming sense of personal\r\nloss that she was smiling and that he could not see that smile. Other,\r\nfuture smiles he would see, but not that particular one, and it seemed\r\nto him that he would never be able to make up for having missed it.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to to know something, Sam?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you’ll listen, I’ll explain exactly how I feel. Have you ever\r\nhad a very exciting book taken away from you just when you were in the\r\nmiddle of it?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I have. It was at Midways, when I was nine. I had borrowed it\r\nfrom the page boy, who was a great friend of mine, and it was about a\r\nman called Cincinnati Kit, who went round most of the time in a mask,\r\nwith lots of revolvers. I had just got half-way in it when my governess\r\ncaught me and I was sent to bed and the book was burned. So I never\r\nfound out what happened in the little room with the steel walls behind\r\nthe bar at the Blue Gulch Saloon. I didn’t get over the disappointment\r\nfor years. Well, when you told me you were going away, I suddenly\r\nrealised that this awful thing was on the point of happening to me\r\nagain, and this time I knew I would never get over it. It suddenly\r\nflashed upon me that there was absolutely nothing worth while in life\r\nexcept to be with you and watch you and wonder what perfectly mad thing\r\nyou would be up to next. Would Aunt Ysobel say that that was love?”\r\n\r\n“She would,” said Sam with conviction.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s my form of it, anyhow. I just want to be with you for years\r\nand years and years, wondering what you’re going to do next.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what I’m going to do at this moment,” said Sam. “I’m\r\ngoing to kiss you.”\r\n\r\nTime passed.\r\n\r\n“Kay,” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know---- No, you’ll laugh.”\r\n\r\n“I promise I won’t. What were you going to say?”\r\n\r\n“That photograph of you--the one I found in the fishing hut.”\r\n\r\n“What about it?”\r\n\r\n“I kissed it once.”\r\n\r\n“Only once?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Sam stoutly. “If you really want the truth, every day; every\r\nblessed single day, and several times a day. Now laugh!”\r\n\r\n“No; I’m going to laugh at you all the rest of my life, but not\r\nto-night. You’re a darling, and I suppose,” said Kay thoughtfully, “I’d\r\nbetter go and tell uncle so, hadn’t I, if he has got back?”\r\n\r\n“Tell your uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he likes to know what’s going on around him in the home.”\r\n\r\n“But that means that you’ll have to go in.”\r\n\r\n“Only for a minute. I shall just pop my head in at the door and say ‘Oh,\r\nuncle, talking of Sam, I love him.’”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Sam earnestly, “if you will swear on your word of\r\nhonour--your sacred word of honour--not to be gone more than thirty\r\nseconds----”\r\n\r\n“As if I could keep away from you longer than that!” said Kay.\r\n\r\nLeft alone in a bleak world, Sam found his thoughts taking for a while a\r\nsombre turn. In the exhilaration of the recent miracle which had altered\r\nthe whole face of the planet, he had tended somewhat to overlook the\r\nfact that for a man about to enter upon the sacred state of matrimony he\r\nwas a little ill equipped with the means of supporting a home. His\r\nweekly salary was in his pocket, and a small sum stood to his credit in\r\na Lombard Street bank; but he could not, he realised, be considered an\r\nexceptionally good match for the least exacting of girls. Indeed, at the\r\nmoment, like the gentleman in the song, all he was in a position to\r\noffer his bride was a happy disposition and a wild desire to succeed.\r\n\r\nThese are damping reflections for a young man to whom the keys of heaven\r\nhave just been given, and they made Sam pensive. But his natural\r\nebullience was not long in coming to the rescue. One turn up and down\r\nthe garden and he was happy again in the possession of lavish rewards\r\nbestowed upon him by beaming bank managers, rejoicing in their hearty\r\nCity fashion as they saw those missing bonds restored to them after many\r\nyears. He refused absolutely to consider the possibility of failure to\r\nunearth the treasure. It must be somewhere in Mon Repos, and if it was\r\nin Mon Repos he would find it--even if, in direct contravention of the\r\nterms of Clause 8 in his lease, he had to tear the house to pieces.\r\n\r\nHe strode, full of a great purpose, to the window of the kitchen. A\r\nlight shone there, and he could hear the rumbling voice of his faithful\r\nhenchman. He tapped upon the window, and presently the blind shot up and\r\nHash’s face appeared. In the background Claire, a little flushed, was\r\nsmoothing her hair. The window opened.\r\n\r\n“Who’s there?” said Hash gruffly.\r\n\r\n“Only me, Hash. I want a word with you.”\r\n\r\n“Ur?”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Hash. Tear yourself away shortly, and come back to Mon Repos.\r\nThere is man’s work to do there.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to search that house from top to bottom. I’ve just found out\r\nthat it’s full of bonds.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say!”\r\n\r\n“I do say.”\r\n\r\n“Nasty things,” said Hash reflectively. “Go off in your ’ands as likely\r\nas not.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the quiet night was rent by a strident voice.\r\n\r\n“Sam! Hi, Sam! Come quick!”\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Willoughby Braddock, and it appeared to proceed from\r\none of the upper rooms of Mon Repos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\r\n\r\nSPIRITED BEHAVIOUR OF MR. BRADDOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Willoughby Braddock, some ten minutes earlier, had parted from Kay\r\nand come out on to the gravel walk in front of San Rafael, he was in a\r\ncondition of mind which it is seldom given to man to achieve until well\r\nthrough the second quart of champagne. So stirred was his soul, so\r\nchurned up by a whirlwind of powerful emotions, that he could have\r\nstepped straight into any hospital as a fever patient and no questions\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nFor the world had become of a sudden amazingly vivid to Willoughby.\r\nAfter a quarter of a century in which absolutely nothing had occurred to\r\nruffle the placid surface of his somewhat stagnant existence, strange\r\nand exhilarating things had begun to happen to him with a startling\r\nabruptness.\r\n\r\nWhen he reflected that he had actually stood chatting face to face with\r\na member of the criminal classes, interrupting him in the very act of\r\nburgling a house, and on top of that had found Lord Tilbury, a man who\r\nwas on the committee of his club, violently transformed into a\r\nsans-culotte, it seemed to him that life in the true meaning of the word\r\nhad at last begun.\r\n\r\nBut it was something that Kay had said that had set the seal on the\r\nthrills of this great day. Quite casually she had mentioned that Mrs.\r\nLippett proposed, as soon as her daughter Claire was married to Hash\r\nTodhunter, to go and live with the young couple. It was as if somebody,\r\nstrolling with stout Balboa, had jerked his thumb at a sheet of water\r\nshining through the trees and observed nonchalantly, “By the way,\r\nthere’s the Pacific.” It was this, even more than the other events of\r\nthe afternoon, that had induced in Mr. Braddock the strange, yeasty\r\nfeeling of unreality which was causing him now to stand gulping on the\r\ngravel. For years he had felt that only a miracle could rid him of Mrs.\r\nLippett’s limpet-like devotion, and now that miracle had happened.\r\n\r\nHe removed his hat and allowed the cool night air to soothe his flaming\r\nforehead. He regretted that he had pledged himself to dinner that night\r\nat the house of his Aunt Julia. Aunt Julia was no bad sort, as aunts go,\r\nbut dinner at her house was scarcely likely to provide him with\r\nmelodrama, and it was melodrama that Mr. Braddock’s drugged soul now\r\ncraved, and nothing but melodrama. It irked him to be compelled to leave\r\nthis suburban maelstrom of swift events and return to a London which\r\ncould not but seem mild and tame by comparison.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had so pledged himself, and the word of a Braddock was his\r\nbond. Moreover, if he were late, Aunt Julia would be shirty to a degree.\r\nReluctantly he started to move toward the two-seater, and had nearly\r\nreached it when he congealed again into a motionless statue. For, even\r\nas he prepared to open the gate of San Rafael, he beheld slinking in at\r\nthe gate of Mon Repos a furtive figure.\r\n\r\nIn his present uplifted frame of mind a figure required to possess only\r\nthe minimum of furtiveness to excitement Willoughby Braddock’s\r\nsuspicions, and this one was well up in what might be called the Class A\r\nof furtiveness. It wavered and it crept. It hesitated and it slunk. And\r\nas the rays from the street lamp shone momentarily upon its face, Mr.\r\nBraddock perceived that it was a drawn and anxious face, the face of one\r\nwho nerves himself to desperate deeds.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the other was feeling nervous. He walked warily, like some\r\nnot too courageous explorer picking his way through a jungle in which he\r\nsuspects the presence of unpleasant wild beasts. Drawn by the lure of\r\ngain to revisit Mon Repos, Chimp Twist was wondering pallidly if each\r\nmoment might not not bring Hash ravening out at him from the shadows.\r\n\r\nHe passed round the angle of the house, and Willoughby Braddock,\r\nreckless of whether or no this postponement of his return to London\r\nwould make him late for dinner at Aunt Julia’s and so cause him to be\r\nproperly ticked off by that punctuality-loving lady, flitted silently\r\nafter him and was in time to see him peer through the kitchen window. A\r\nmoment later, his peering seeming to have had a reassuring effect, he\r\nhad opened the back door and was inside the house.\r\n\r\nWilloughby Braddock did not hesitate. The idea of being alone in a small\r\nsemi-detached house with a desperate criminal who was probably armed to\r\nthe gills meant nothing to him now. In fact, he rather preferred it. He\r\nslid silently through the back door in the fellow’s wake; and having\r\nremoved his shoes, climbed the kitchen stairs. A noise from above told\r\nhim that he was on the right track. Whatever it was that the furtive\r\nbloke was doing, he was doing it upstairs.\r\n\r\nAs for Chimp Twist, he was now going nicely. The operations which he was\r\nconducting were swift and simple. Once he had ascertained by a survey\r\nthrough the kitchen window that his enemy, Hash, was not on the\r\npremises, all his nervousness had vanished. Possessing himself of the\r\nchisel which he had placed in the drawer of the kitchen table in\r\nreadiness for just such an emergency, he went briskly upstairs. The\r\nlight was burning in the hall and also in the drawing-room; but the\r\nabsence of sounds encouraged him to believe that Sam, like Hash, was\r\nout. This proved to be the case, and he went on his way completely\r\nreassured. All he wanted was five minutes alone and undisturbed, for the\r\ndirections contained in Mr. Finglass’ letter had been specific; and once\r\nhe had broken through the door of the top back bedroom, he anticipated\r\nno difficulty in unearthing the buried treasure. It was, Mr. Finglass\r\nhad definitely stated, a mere matter of lifting a board. Chimp Twist did\r\nnot sing as he climbed the stairs, for he was a prudent man, but he felt\r\nlike singing.\r\n\r\nA sharp cracking noise came to Willoughby Braddock’s ears as he halted\r\nsnakily on the first landing. It sounded like the breaking open of a\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. Chimp, had the conditions been favourable, would have\r\npreferred to insinuate himself into Hash’s boudoir in a manner involving\r\nless noise; but in this enterprise of his time was of the essence and he\r\nhad no leisure for niggling at locks with a chisel. Arriving on the\r\nthreshold, he raised his boot and drove it like a battering-ram.\r\n\r\nThe doors of suburban villas are not constructed to stand rough\r\ntreatment. If they fit within an inch or two and do not fall down when\r\nthe cat rubs against them, the architect, builder and surveyor shake\r\nhands and congratulate themselves on a good bit of work. And Chimp,\r\nthough a small man, had a large foot. The lock yielded before him and\r\nthe door swung open. He went in and lit the gas. Then he took a rapid\r\nsurvey of his surroundings.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up the second flight of stairs, Willoughby Braddock stood\r\nlistening. His face was pink and determined. As far as he was concerned,\r\nAunt Julia might go and boil herself. Dinner or no dinner, he meant to\r\nsee this thing through.\r\n\r\nChimp wasted no time.\r\n\r\n“The stuff,” his friend, the late Edward Finglass, had written, “is in\r\nthe top back bedroom. You’ve only to lift the third board from the\r\nwindow and put your hand in, Chimpie, and there it is.” And after this\r\nhad come a lot of foolish stuff about sharing with Soapy Molloy. A\r\ntrifle maudlin old Finky had become on his deathbed, it seemed to Chimp.\r\n\r\nAnd, hurried though he was, Chimp Twist had time to indulge in a brief\r\nsmile as he thought of Soapy Molloy. He also managed to fit in a brief\r\nmoment of complacent meditation, the trend of which was that when it\r\ncomes to a show-down brains will tell. He, Chimp Twist, was the guy with\r\nthe brains, and the result was that in about another half minute he\r\nwould be in possession of American-bearer securities to the value of\r\ntwo million dollars. Whereas poor old Soapy, who had just about enough\r\nintelligence to open his mouth when he wished to eat, would go through\r\nlife eking out a precarious existence, selling fictitious oil stock to\r\nmembers of the public who were one degree more cloth-headed than\r\nhimself. There was a moral to be drawn from this, felt Chimp, but his\r\ntime was too valuable to permit him to stand there drawing it. He\r\ngripped his chisel and got to work.\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock, peering in at the door with the caution of a red Indian\r\nstalking a relative by marriage with a tomahawk, saw that the intruder\r\nhad lifted a board and was groping in the cavity. His heart beat like a\r\nmotor-bicycle. It gave him some little surprise that the fellow did not\r\nhear it.\r\n\r\nPresumably the fellow was too occupied. Certainly he seemed like a man\r\nwhose mind was on his job. Having groped for some moments, he now\r\nuttered a sound that was half an oath and half a groan, and as if seized\r\nwith a frenzy, began tearing up other boards, first one, then another,\r\nafter that a third. It was as though this business of digging up boards\r\nhad begun to grip him like some drug. Starting in a modest way with a\r\nsingle board he had been unable to check the craving, and it now\r\nappeared to be his intention to excavate the entire floor.\r\n\r\nBut he was not allowed to proceed with this work uninterrupted. Possibly\r\nthis wholesale demolition of bedrooms jarred upon Mr. Braddock’s\r\nsensibilities as a householder. At any rate, he chose this moment to\r\nintervene.\r\n\r\n“I say, look here!” he said.\r\n\r\nIt had been his intention, for he was an enthusiastic reader of\r\nsensational fiction and knew the formulæ as well as anyone, to say\r\n“Hands up!” But the words had slipped from him without his volition. He\r\nhastily corrected himself.\r\n\r\n“I mean, Hands up!” he said.\r\n\r\nThen backing to the window, he flung it open and shouted into the night.\r\n\r\n“Sam! Hi, Sam! Come quick!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\r\n\r\nTHE MISSING MILLIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThose captious critics who are always on the alert to catch the\r\nhistorian napping and expose in his relation of events some damaging\r\nflaw will no doubt have seized avidly on what appears to be a blunder in\r\nthe incident just recorded. Where, they will ask, did Willoughby\r\nBraddock get the revolver, without which a man may say “Hands up!” till\r\nhe is hoarse and achieve no result? For of all the indispensable\r\narticles of costume which the well-dressed man must wear if he wishes to\r\ngo about saying “Hands up!” to burglars, a revolver is the one which can\r\nleast easily be omitted.\r\n\r\nWe have no secrets from posterity. Willoughby Braddock possessed no\r\nrevolver. But he had four fingers on his right hand, and two of these he\r\nwas now thrusting earnestly against the inside of his coat pocket. Wax\r\nto receive and marble to retain, Willoughby Braddock had not forgotten\r\nthe ingenious subterfuge by means of which Soapy Molloy had been enabled\r\nto intimidate Lord Tilbury, and he employed it now upon Chimp Twist.\r\n\r\n“You low blister!” said Mr. Braddock.\r\n\r\nWhether this simple device would have been effective with a person of\r\nferocious and hard-boiled temperament, one cannot say; but fortunately\r\nChimp was not of this description. His strength was rather of the head\r\nthan of the heart. He was a man who shrank timidly from even the\r\nappearance of violence; and though he may have had doubts as to the\r\ngenuineness of Mr. Braddock’s pistol, he had none concerning the\r\nlatter’s physique. Willoughby Braddock was no Hercules, but he was some\r\nfour inches taller and some sixty pounds heavier than Chimp, and it was\r\nnot in Mr. Twist’s character to embark upon a rough-and-tumble with such\r\nodds against him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Chimp would not lightly have embarked on a rough-and-tumble with\r\nanyone who was not an infant in arms or a member of the personnel of\r\nSinger’s Troupe of Midgets.\r\n\r\nHe tottered against the wall and stood there, blinking. The sudden\r\nmaterialisation of Willoughby Braddock, apparently out of thin air, had\r\ngiven him a violent shock, from which he had not even begun to recover.\r\n\r\n“You man of wrath!” said Mr. Braddock.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps of one leaping from stair to stair made themselves heard.\r\nSam charged in.\r\n\r\n“What’s up?”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock, with pardonable unction, directed his notice to the\r\ncaptive.\r\n\r\n“Another of the gang,” he said. “I caught him.”\r\n\r\nSam gazed at Chimp and looked away, disappointed.\r\n\r\n“You poor idiot,” he said peevishly. “That’s my odd-job man.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“My odd-job man.”\r\n\r\nWilloughby Braddock felt for an instant damped. Then his spirits rose\r\nagain. He knew little of the duties of odd-job men; but whatever they\r\nwere, this one, he felt, had surely exceeded them.\r\n\r\n“Well, why was he digging up the floor?”\r\n\r\nAnd Sam, glancing down, saw that this was what his eccentric employee\r\nhad, indeed, been doing; and suspicion blazed up within him.\r\n\r\n“What’s the game?” he demanded, eying Chimp.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Mr. Braddock. “The game--what is it?”\r\n\r\nChimp’s nerves had recovered a little of their tone. His agile brain was\r\nstirring once more.\r\n\r\n“You can’t do anything,” he said. “It wasn’t breaking and entering. I\r\nlive here. I know the law.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind about that. What were you up to?”\r\n\r\n“Looking for something,” said Chimp sullenly. “And it wasn’t there.”\r\n\r\n“Did you know Finglass?” asked Sam keenly.\r\n\r\nChimp gave a short laugh of intense bitterness.\r\n\r\n“I thought I did. But I didn’t know he was so fond of a joke.”\r\n\r\n“Bradder,” said Sam urgently, “a crook named Finglass used to live in\r\nthis house, and he buried a lot of his swag somewhere in it.”\r\n\r\n“Good gosh!” exclaimed Mr. Braddock. “You don’t say so!”\r\n\r\n“Did this fellow take anything from under the floor?”\r\n\r\n“You bet your sweet life I didn’t,” said Chimp with feeling. “It wasn’t\r\nthere. You seem to know all about it, so I don’t mind telling you that\r\nFinky wrote me that the stuff was under the third board from the window\r\nin this room. Whether he was off his damned head or was just stringing\r\nme, I don’t know. But I do know it isn’t there. And now I’m going.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, you aren’t, by Jove!” said Mr. Braddock.\r\n\r\n“Oh, let him go,” said Sam wearily. “What’s the use of keeping him\r\nhanging round?” He turned to Chimp. His own disappointment was so keen\r\nthat he could almost sympathise with him. “So you think Finglass really\r\ngot away with the stuff, after all?”\r\n\r\n“Looks like it.”\r\n\r\n“Then why on earth did he write to you?”\r\n\r\nChimp shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Off his nut, I guess. He always was a loony sort of bird, outside of\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t think the other chap found the stuff, Sam?” suggested Mr.\r\nBraddock.\r\n\r\nSam shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I doubt it. It’s much more likely it was never here at all. We had a\r\nfriend of yours here this evening,” he said to Chimp. “At least, I\r\nsuppose he was a friend of yours. Thomas G. Gunn he called himself.”\r\n\r\n“I know who you mean--that poor dumb brick, Soapy. He wouldn’t have\r\nfound anything. If it isn’t here it isn’t anywhere. And now I’m going.”\r\n\r\nMr. Braddock eyed him a little wistfully as he slouched through the\r\ndoorway. It was galling to see the only burglar he had ever caught\r\nwalking out as if he had finished paying a friendly call. However, he\r\nsupposed there was nothing to be done about it. Sam had gone to the\r\nwindow and was leaning out, looking into the night.\r\n\r\n“I must go and see Kay,” he said at length, turning.\r\n\r\n“I must get up to town,” said Mr. Braddock. “By Jove, I shall be most\r\nfrightfully late if I don’t rush. I’m dining with my Aunt Julia.”\r\n\r\n“This is going to be bad news for her.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, she’ll be most awfully interested. She’s a very sporting old\r\nparty.”\r\n\r\n“What the devil are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“My Aunt Julia.”\r\n\r\n“Oh? Well, good-bye.”\r\n\r\nSam left the room, and Willoughby Braddock, following him at some little\r\ndistance, for his old friend seemed disinclined for company and\r\nconversation, heard the front door bang. He sat down on the stairs and\r\nbegan to put on his shoes, which he had cached on the first landing.\r\nWhile he was engaged in this task, the front doorbell rang. He went down\r\nto open it, one shoe off and one shoe on, and found on the steps an aged\r\ngentleman with a white beard.\r\n\r\n“Is Mr. Shotter here?” asked the aged gentleman.\r\n\r\n“Just gone round next door. Mr. Cornelius, isn’t it? I expect you’ve\r\nforgotten me--Willoughby Braddock. I met you for a minute or two when I\r\nwas staying with Mr. Wrenn.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes. And how is the world using you, Mr. Braddock?”\r\n\r\nWilloughby was only too glad to tell him. A confidant was precisely what\r\nin his exalted frame of mind he most desired.\r\n\r\n“Everything’s absolutely topping, thanks. What with burglars floating in\r\nevery two minutes and Lord Tilbury getting de-bagged and all that,\r\nlife’s just about right. And my housekeeper is leaving me.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear that.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t. What it means is that now I shall at last be able to buzz off\r\nand see life. Have all sorts of adventures, you know. I’m frightfully\r\nkeen on adventure.”\r\n\r\n“You should come and live in Valley Fields, Mr. Braddock. There is\r\nalways some excitement going on here.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you’re not far wrong. Still, what I meant was more the biffing off\r\non the out-trail stuff. I’m going to see the world. I’m going to be one\r\nof those fellows Kipling writes about. I was talking to a chap of that\r\nsort at the club the other day. He said he could remember Uganda when\r\nthere wasn’t a white man there.”\r\n\r\n“I can remember Valley Fields when it had not a single cinema house.”\r\n\r\n“This fellow was once treed by a rhinoceros for six hours.”\r\n\r\n“A similar thing happened to a Mr. Walkinshaw, who lived at Balmoral, in\r\nAcacia Road. He came back from London one Saturday afternoon in a new\r\ntweed suit, and his dog, failing to recognise him, chased him on to the\r\nroof of the summer house.... Well, I must be getting along, Mr.\r\nBraddock. I promised to read extracts from my history of Valley Fields\r\nto Mr. Shotter. Perhaps you would care to hear them too.”\r\n\r\n“I should love it, but I’ve got to dash off and dine with my Aunt\r\nJulia.”\r\n\r\n“Some other time perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely.... By the way, that man I was telling you about. He was as\r\nnear as a toucher bitten by a shark once.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing to what happens in Valley Fields,” said Mr. Cornelius\r\npatriotically. “The occupant of the Firs at the corner of Buller Street\r\nand Myrtle Avenue--a Mr. Phillimore--perhaps you have heard of him?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Edwin Phillimore. Connected with the firm of Birkett, Birkett,\r\nBirkett, Son, Podmarsh, Podmarsh & Birkett, the solicitors.”\r\n\r\n“What about him?”\r\n\r\n“Last summer,” said Mr. Cornelius, “he was bitten by a guinea pig.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\r\n\r\nMR. CORNELIUS READS HIS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, and one frequently noted by philosophers, that\r\nevery woman in this world cherishes within herself a deep-rooted belief,\r\nfrom which nothing can shake her, that the particular man to whom she\r\nhas plighted her love is to be held personally blameworthy for\r\npractically all of the untoward happenings of life. The vapid and\r\nirreflective would call these things accidents, but she knows better. If\r\nshe arrives at a station at five minutes past nine to catch a train\r\nwhich has already left at nine minutes past five, she knows that it is\r\nher Henry who is responsible, just as he was responsible the day before\r\nfor a shower of rain coming on when she was wearing her new hat.\r\n\r\nBut there was sterling stuff in Kay Derrick. Although no doubt she felt\r\nin her secret heart that the omission of the late Mr. Edward Finglass to\r\ndeposit his ill-gotten gains beneath the floor of the top back bedroom\r\nof Mon Repos could somehow have been avoided if Sam had shown a little\r\nenterprise and common sense, she uttered no word of reproach. Her\r\nreception of the bad news, indeed, when, coming out into the garden, he\r\nsaw her waiting for him on the lawn of San Rafael and climbed the fence\r\nto deliver it, was such as to confirm once and for all his enthusiastic\r\nview of her splendid qualities. Where others would have blamed, she\r\nsympathised. And not content with mere sympathy, she went on to minimise\r\nthe disaster with soothing argument.\r\n\r\n“What does it matter?” she said. “We have each other.”\r\n\r\nThe mind of man, no less than that of woman, works strangely. When, a\r\nfew days before, Sam had read that identical sentiment, couched in\r\nalmost exactly the same words, as part of the speech addressed by Leslie\r\nMordyke to the girl of his choice in the third galley of Cordelia\r\nBlair’s gripping serial, _Hearts Aflame_, he had actually gone so far as\r\nto write in the margin the words, “Silly fool!” Now he felt that he had\r\nnever heard anything not merely so beautiful but so thoroughly sensible,\r\npractical and inspired.\r\n\r\n“That’s right!” he cried.\r\n\r\nIf he had been standing by a table he would have banged it with his\r\nfist. Situated as he was, in the middle of a garden, all he could do was\r\nto kiss Kay. This he did.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he said, when the first paroxysm of enthusiasm had passed,\r\n“there’s just this one point to be taken into consideration. I’ve lost\r\nmy job, and I don’t know how I’m to get another.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you’ll get another!”\r\n\r\n“Why, so I will!” said Sam, astounded by the clearness of her reasoning.\r\nThe idea that the female intelligence was inferior to the male seemed to\r\nhim a gross fallacy. How few men could have thought a thing all out in\r\na flash like that.\r\n\r\n“It may not be a big job, but that will be all the more fun.”\r\n\r\n“So it will.”\r\n\r\n“I always think that people who marry on practically nothing have a\r\nwonderful time.”\r\n\r\n“Terrific!”\r\n\r\n“So exciting.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I can cook a bit.”\r\n\r\n“I can wash dishes.”\r\n\r\n“If you’re poor, you enjoy occasional treats. If you’re rich, you just\r\nget bored with pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“Bored stiff.”\r\n\r\n“And probably drift apart.”\r\n\r\nSam could not follow her here. Loth as he was to disagree with her\r\nlightest word, this was going too far.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said firmly, “if I had a million I wouldn’t drift apart from\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You might.”\r\n\r\n“No, I wouldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I’m only saying you might.”\r\n\r\n“But I shouldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow,” said Kay, yielding the point, “all I’m saying is that it\r\nwill be much more fun being awfully hard up and watching the pennies and\r\ngoing out to the Palais de Dance at Hammersmith on Saturday night, or if\r\nit was my birthday or something, and cooking our own dinner and making\r\nmy own clothes, than--than----”\r\n\r\n“----living in a gilded cage, watching love stifle,” said Sam,\r\nremembering Leslie Mordyke’s remarks on the subject.\r\n\r\n“Yes. So, honestly, I’m very glad it was all a fairy story about that\r\nmoney being in Mon Repos.”\r\n\r\n“So am I. Darned glad.”\r\n\r\n“I’d have hated to have it.”\r\n\r\n“So would I.”\r\n\r\n“And I think it’s jolly, your uncle disinheriting you.”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely corking.”\r\n\r\n“It would have spoiled everything, having a big allowance from him.”\r\n\r\n“Everything.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, we should have missed all the fun we’re going to have, and we\r\nshouldn’t have felt so close together and----”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Do you know, I knew a wretched devil in America who came into\r\nabout twenty million dollars when his father died, and he went and\r\nmarried a girl with about double that in her own right.”\r\n\r\n“What became of him?” asked Kay, shocked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. We lost touch. But just imagine that marriage!”\r\n\r\n“Awful!”\r\n\r\n“What possible fun could they have had?”\r\n\r\n“None. What was his name?”\r\n\r\n“Blenkiron,” said Sam in a hushed voice. “And hers was Poskitt.”\r\n\r\nFor some moments, deeply affected by the tragedy of these two poor bits\r\nof human wreckage, they stood in silence. Sam felt near to tears, and he\r\nthought Kay was bearing up only with some difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe door leading into the garden opened. Light from the house flashed\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n“Somebody’s coming out,” said Kay, giving a little start as though she\r\nhad been awakened from a dream.\r\n\r\n“Curse them!” said Sam. “Or rather, no,” he corrected himself. “I think\r\nit’s your uncle.”\r\n\r\nEven at such a moment as this, he could harbour no harsh thought toward\r\nany relative of hers.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Wrenn. He stood on the steps, peering out.\r\n\r\n“Kay!” he called.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’re there. Is Shotter with you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Could you both come in for a minute?” inquired Mr. Wrenn, his\r\nvoice--for he was a man of feeling--conveying a touch of apology.\r\n“Cornelius is here. He wants to read you that chapter from his history\r\nof Valley Fields.”\r\n\r\nSam groaned in spirit. On such a night as this young Troilus had climbed\r\nthe walls of Troy and stood gazing at the Grecian tents where lay his\r\nCressida, and he himself had got to go into a stuffy house and listen to\r\na bore with a white beard drooling on about the mouldy past of a London\r\nsuburb.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, I know; but----” he began doubtfully.\r\n\r\nKay laid a hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n“We can’t disappoint the poor old man,” she whispered. “He would take it\r\nto heart so.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I mean----”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Just as you say,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe was going to make a good husband.\r\n\r\nMr. Cornelius was in the drawing-room. From under his thick white brows\r\nhe peered at them, as they entered, with the welcoming eyes of a man\r\nwho, loving the sound of his own voice, sees a docile audience\r\nassembling. He took from the floor a large brown paper parcel and,\r\nhaving carefully unfastened the string which tied it, revealed a second\r\nand lighter wrapping of brown paper. Removing this, he disclosed a layer\r\nof newspaper, then another, and finally a formidable typescript bound\r\nabout with lilac ribbon.\r\n\r\n“The matter having to do with the man Finglass occurs in Chapter Seven\r\nof my book,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Just one chapter?” said Sam, with a touch of hope.\r\n\r\n“That chapter describes the man’s first visit to my office, my early\r\nimpressions of him, his words as nearly as I can remember them, and a\r\nfew other preliminary details. In Chapter Nine----”\r\n\r\n“Chapter Nine!” echoed Sam, aghast. “You know, as a matter of fact,\r\nthere really isn’t any need to read all that, because it turns out that\r\nFinglass never----”\r\n\r\n“In Chapter Nine,” proceeded Mr. Cornelius, adjusting a large pair of\r\nhorn-rimmed spectacles, “I show him accepted perfectly unsuspiciously by\r\nthe residents of the suburb, and I have described at some length,\r\nbecause it is important as indicating how completely his outward\r\nrespectability deceived those with whom he came in contact, a garden\r\nparty given by Mrs. Bellamy-North, of Beau Rivage, in Burberry Road, at\r\nwhich he appeared and spoke a few words on the subject of the\r\nforthcoming election for the district council.”\r\n\r\n“We shall love to hear that,” said Kay brightly. Her eye, wandering\r\naside, met Sam’s. Sam, who had opened his mouth, closed it again.\r\n\r\n“I remember that day very distinctly,” said Mr. Cornelius. “It was a\r\nbeautiful afternoon in June, and the garden of Beau Rivage was looking\r\nextraordinarily attractive. It was larger, of course, in those days. The\r\nhouse which I call Beau Rivage in my history has since been converted\r\ninto two semi-detached houses, known as Beau Rivage and Sans Souci. That\r\nis a change which has taken place in a great number of cases in this\r\nneighbourhood. Five years ago Burberry Road was a more fashionable\r\nquarter, and the majority of the houses were detached. This house where\r\nwe are now sitting, for example, and its neighbour, Mon Repos, were a\r\nsingle residence when Edward Finglass came to Valley Fields. Its name\r\nwas then Mon Repos, and it was only some eighteen months later that San\r\nRafael came into existence as a separate----”\r\n\r\nHe broke off; and breaking off, bit his tongue, for that had occurred\r\nwhich had startled him considerably. One unit in his audience, until\r\nthat moment apparently as quiet and well-behaved as the other units, had\r\nsuddenly, to all appearances, gone off his head. The young man Shotter,\r\nuttering a piercing cry, had leaped to his feet and was exhibiting\r\nstrange emotion.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” cried Sam. “What did you say?”\r\n\r\nMr. Cornelius regarded him through a mist of tears. His tongue was\r\ngiving him considerable pain.\r\n\r\n“Did you say,” demanded Sam, “that in Finglass’ time San Rafael was part\r\nof Mon Repos?”\r\n\r\n“Yeh,” said Mr. Cornelius, rubbing the wound tenderly against the roof\r\nof his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Give me a chisel!” bellowed Sam. “Where’s a chisel? I want a chisel!”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\n“Bleck my soul!” said Mr. Cornelius. He spoke a little thickly, for his\r\ntongue was still painful. But its anguish was forgotten under the spell\r\nof a stronger emotion. Five minutes had passed since Sam’s remarkable\r\noutburst in the drawing-room; and now, with Mr. Wrenn and Kay, he was\r\nstanding in the top back bedroom of San Rafael, watching the young man\r\nas he drew up from the chasm in which he had been groping a very\r\nyellowed, very dusty package which crackled and crumbled in his fingers.\r\n\r\n“Bleck my soul!” said Mr. Cornelius.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” said Mr. Wrenn.\r\n\r\n“Sam!” cried Kay.\r\n\r\nSam did not hear their voices. With the look of a mother bending over\r\nher sleeping babe, he was staring at the parcel.\r\n\r\n“Two million!” said Sam, choking. “Two million--count ’em--two million!”\r\n\r\nA light of pure avarice shone in his eyes. He looked like a man who had\r\nnever heard of the unhappy fate of Dwight Blenkiron, of Chicago,\r\nIllinois, and Genevieve, his bride, _née_ Poskitt; or who, having heard,\r\ndid not give a whoop.\r\n\r\n“What’s ten per cent on two million?” asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nValley Fields lay asleep. Clocks had been wound, cats put out of back\r\ndoors, front doors bolted and chained. In a thousand homes a thousand\r\ngood householders were restoring their tissues against the labours of\r\nanother day. The silver-voiced clock on the big tower over the college\r\nstruck the hour of two.\r\n\r\nBut though most of its inhabitants were prudently getting their eight\r\nhours and insuring that schoolgirl complexion, footsteps still made\r\nthemselves heard in the silence of Burberry Road. They were those of Sam\r\nShotter of Mon Repos, pacing up and down outside the gate of San Rafael.\r\nLong since had Mr. Wrenn, who slept in the front of that house, begun to\r\nwish Sam Shotter in bed or dead; but he was a mild and kindly man, loth\r\nto shout winged words out of windows. So Sam paced, unrebuked, until\r\npresently other footsteps joined in chorus with his and he perceived\r\nthat he was no longer alone.\r\n\r\nA lantern shone upon him.\r\n\r\n“Out late, sir,” said the sleepless guardian of the peace behind him.\r\n\r\n“Late?” said Sam. Trifles like time meant nothing to him. “Is it late?”\r\n\r\n“Just gone two, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Oh? Then perhaps I had better be going to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Suit yourself, sir. Resident here, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then I wonder,” said the constable, “if I can interest you in a concert\r\nwhich is shortly to take place in aid of a charitubulorganisation\r\nconnection with a body of men to ’oom you as a nouse’older will----”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe in palmists?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir---- be the first to admit that you owe the safety of your\r\nperson and the tranquillity of your ’ome--the police.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let me tell you this,” said Sam warmly: “Some time ago a palmist\r\ntold me that I was shortly about to be married, and I am shortly about\r\nto be married.”\r\n\r\n“Wish you luck, sir. Then perhaps I can ’ave the pleasure of selling you\r\nand your good lady to be a couple of tickets for this concert in aid of\r\nthe Policemen’s Orphanage. Tickets, which may be ’ad in any quantity,\r\nconsist of the five-shilling ticket----”\r\n\r\n“Are you married?”\r\n\r\n“Yes sir---- the three-shilling ticket, the half-crown ticket, the\r\nshilling ticket, and the sixpenny ticket.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the only life, isn’t it?” said Sam.\r\n\r\n“That of the policeman, sir, or the orphan?”\r\n\r\n“Married life.”\r\n\r\nThe constable ruminated.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” he replied judicially, “it’s like most things--’as its\r\nadvantages and its disadvantages.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Sam, “I can see that if two people married without\r\nhaving any money, it might lead to a lot of unhappiness. But if you’ve\r\nplenty of money, nothing can possibly go wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Have you plenty of money, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Pots of it.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, sir, I recommend the five-shilling tickets. Say, one for\r\nyourself, one for your good lady to be and--to make up the round\r\nsovereign--a couple for any gentlemen friends you may meet at the club\r\n’oo may desire to be present at what you can take it from me will be a\r\nslap-up entertainment, high class from start to finish. Constable\r\nPurvis will render Asleep on the Deep----”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Sam, suddenly becoming aware that the man was babbling\r\nabout something, “what on earth are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“Tickets, sir.”\r\n\r\n“But you don’t need tickets to get married.”\r\n\r\n“You need tickets to be present at the annual concert in aid of the\r\nPolicemen’s Orphanage, and I strongly advocate the purchase of ’alf a\r\ndozen of the five-shilling.”\r\n\r\n“How much are the five-shilling?”\r\n\r\n“Five shillings, sir.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve only got a ten-pound note on me.”\r\n\r\n“Bring your change to your ’ome to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nSam became aware with a shudder of self-loathing that he was allowing\r\nthis night of nights to be marred by sordid huckstering.\r\n\r\n“Never mind the change,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Keep it all. I’m going to be married,” he added in explanation.\r\n\r\n“Keep the ’ole ten pounds, sir?” quavered the stupefied officer.\r\n\r\n“Certainly. What’s ten pounds?”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\n“If everybody was like you, sir,” said the constable at length, in a\r\ndeep, throaty voice, “the world would be a better place.”\r\n\r\n“The world couldn’t be a better place,” said Sam. “Good night.”\r\n\r\n“Good night, sir,” said the constable reverently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               (THE END)"
