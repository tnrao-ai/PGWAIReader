In many ways the Strollers’,\r\nthough not the most magnificent, is the pleasantest club in New York.\r\nIts ideals are those of the Savage Club—comfort without pomp—and it is\r\ngiven over after eleven o’clock at night mainly to the Stage. Everybody\r\nis young, clean-shaven, and full of conversation—and the conversation\r\nstrikes a purely professional note.\r\n\r\nEverybody in the room on this July night had come from the theatre. Most\r\nof those present had been acting, but a certain number had been to the\r\nopening performance of the latest better-than-“Raffles” play. There had\r\nbeen something of a boom that season in dramas whose heroes appealed to\r\nthe public more pleasantly across the footlights than they might have\r\ndone in real life. In the play which had opened tonight Arthur Mifflin,\r\nan exemplary young man off the stage, had been warmly applauded for a\r\nseries of actions which, performed anywhere except in the theatre, would\r\ncertainly have debarred him from remaining a member of the Strollers’ or\r\nany other club. In faultless evening dress, with a debonair smile on his\r\nface, he had broken open a safe, stolen bonds and jewellery to a large\r\namount, and escaped without a blush of shame via the window. He had\r\nfoiled a detective through four acts and held up a band of pursuers with\r\na revolver. A large audience had intimated complete approval throughout.\r\n\r\n“It’s a hit all right,” said somebody through the smoke.\r\n\r\n“These imitation ‘Raffles’ plays always are,” grumbled Willett, who\r\nplayed bluff fathers in musical comedy. “A few years ago they would have\r\nbeen scared to death of putting on a show with a criminal hero. Now, it\r\nseems to me, the public doesn’t want anything else. Not that they know\r\nwhat they do want,” he concluded mournfully.\r\n\r\n_The Belle of Boulogne_, in which Willett sustained the role of Cyrus K.\r\nHiggs, a Chicago millionaire, was slowly fading away on a diet of free\r\npasses, and this possibly prejudiced him.\r\n\r\nRaikes, the character-actor, changed the subject. If Willett once got\r\nstarted on the wrongs of the ill-fated _Belle_, general conversation\r\nwould become impossible. Willett, denouncing the stupidity of the\r\npublic, was purely a monologue artiste.\r\n\r\n“I saw Jimmy Pitt at the show,” said Raikes. Everybody displayed\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy Pitt? When did he come back? I thought he was in England?”\r\n\r\n“He came on the _Mauretania_, I suppose. She docked this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy Pitt?” said Sutton, of the Majestic Theatre. “How long has he\r\nbeen away? Last I saw of him was at the opening of _The Outsider_, at\r\nthe Astor. That’s a couple of months ago.”\r\n\r\n“He’s been travelling in Europe, I believe,” said Raikes. “Lucky beggar\r\nto be able to. I wish I could.”\r\n\r\nSutton knocked the ash off his cigar.\r\n\r\n“I envy Jimmy,” he said. “I don’t know any one I’d rather be. He’s got\r\nmuch more money than any man, except a professional plute, has any right\r\nto. He’s as strong as an ox. I shouldn’t say he’d ever had anything\r\nworse than measles in his life. He’s got no relations. And he isn’t\r\nmarried.”\r\n\r\nSutton, who had been married three times, spoke with some feeling.\r\n\r\n“He’s a good chap, Jimmy,” said Raikes. “Which considering he’s an\r\nEnglishman——”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said Mifflin.\r\n\r\n“How’s that? Oh, beg pardon, Arthur; I keep forgetting that you’re one,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tattoo a Union Jack on my forehead tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll improve you,” said Raikes. “But about Jimmy. He’s a good chap,\r\nwhich—considering he’s an Englishman—is only what you might have\r\nexpected. Is that better, Arthur?”\r\n\r\n“Much,” said Mifflin. “Yes, Jimmy is a good chap—one of the best. I’ve\r\nknown him for years. I was at school and Cambridge with him. He was\r\nabout the most popular man at both. I should say he had put more\r\ndeadbeats on their legs again than half the men in New York put\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” growled Willett, whom the misfortunes of _The Belle_ had soured,\r\n“what’s there in that? It’s mighty easy to do the philanthropist act\r\nwhen you’re next door to a millionaire.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mifflin warmly; “but it’s not so easy when you’re getting\r\nthirty dollars a week on a newspaper. When Jimmy was a reporter on the\r\n_News_ there used to be a whole crowd of fellows just living on him. Not\r\nborrowing an occasional dollar, mind you, but living on him—sleeping on\r\nhis sofa and staying to breakfast. It made me mad. I used to ask him why\r\nhe stood it. He said there was nowhere else for them to go, and he\r\nthought he could see them through all right. Which he did, though I\r\ndon’t see how he managed it on thirty dollars a week.”\r\n\r\n“If a man’s fool enough to be an easy mark——” began Willett.\r\n\r\n“Oh, stop it,” said Raikes. “We don’t want anybody knocking Jimmy here.”\r\n\r\n“All the same,” said Sutton, “it seems to me that it was darned lucky\r\nthat he came into that money. You can’t keep open house for ever on\r\nthirty a week. By the way, Arthur, how was that? I heard it was his\r\nuncle.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t his uncle,” said Mifflin. “It was by way of being a romance\r\nof sorts, I believe. Fellow who had been in love with Jimmy’s mother\r\nyears ago. Went to Australia, made a fortune, and left it to Mrs. Pitt\r\nor her children. She had been dead some time when that happened. Jimmy,\r\nof course, hadn’t a notion of what was coming to him, when suddenly he\r\ngot a solicitor’s letter, asking him to call. He rolled round, and found\r\nthat there was about five hundred thousand dollars waiting for him to\r\nspend it.”\r\n\r\nJimmy Pitt had now definitely ousted _Love, the Cracksman_, as a topic\r\nof conversation. Everybody present knew him. Most of them had known him\r\nin his newspaper days; and though every man there would have perished\r\nrather than admit it, they were grateful to Jimmy for being exactly the\r\nsame to them now that he could sign a cheque for half a million as he\r\nhad been on the old thirty-a-week basis. Inherited wealth, of course,\r\ndoes not make a young man nobler or more admirable; but the young man\r\ndoes not always know this.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy’s had a queer life,” said Mifflin. “He’s been pretty nearly\r\neverything in his time. Did you know he was on the stage before he took\r\nup newspaper work? Only in touring companies, I believe. He got tired of\r\nit, and dropped it. That’s always been his trouble. He wouldn’t settle\r\ndown to anything. He studied Law at the ’Varsity, but he never kept it\r\nup. After he left the stage he moved all over the States without a cent,\r\npicking up any odd job he could get. He was a waiter once for a couple\r\nof days, but they sacked him for breaking plates. Then he got a job in a\r\njeweller’s shop. I believe he’s a bit of an expert on jewels. And\r\nanother time he made a hundred dollars by staying three rounds against\r\nKid Brady, when the Kid was touring the country after he got the\r\nchampionship away from Jimmy Garwin. The Kid was offering a hundred to\r\nanyone who could last three rounds with him. Jimmy did it on his head.\r\nHe was the best amateur of his weight I ever saw. The Kid wanted him to\r\ntake up scrapping seriously. But Jimmy wouldn’t have stuck to anything\r\nlong enough in those days. He’s one of the gipsies of the world. He was\r\nnever really happy unless he was on the move, and he doesn’t seem to\r\nhave altered since he came into his money.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he can afford to keep on the move now,” said Raikes. “I wish I——”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever hear about Jimmy and——” Mifflin was beginning, when the\r\nOdyssey of Jimmy Pitt was interrupted by the opening of the door and the\r\nentrance of Ulysses in person.\r\n\r\nJimmy Pitt was a young man of medium height, whose great breadth and\r\ndepth of chest made him look shorter than he really was. His jaw was\r\nsquare and protruded slightly; and this, combined with a certain\r\nathletic jauntiness of carriage and a pair of piercing brown eyes very\r\nmuch like those of a bull-terrier, gave him an air of aggressiveness\r\nwhich belied his character. He was not aggressive. He had the good\r\nnature as well as the eyes of a bull-terrier. He also possessed, when\r\nstirred, all the bull-terrier’s dogged determination.\r\n\r\nThere were shouts of welcome.\r\n\r\n“Holloa, Jimmy!”\r\n\r\n“When did you get back?”\r\n\r\n“Come and sit down. Plenty of room over here.”\r\n\r\n“Where is my wandering boy to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Waiter! What’s yours, Jimmy?”\r\n\r\nJimmy dropped into a seat and yawned.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “how goes it? Halloa, Raikes! Weren’t you at _Love, the\r\nCracksman_? I thought I saw you. Halloa, Arthur! Congratulate you. You\r\nspoke your piece nicely.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said Mifflin. “We were just talking about you, Jimmy. You came\r\non the _Mauretania_, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“She didn’t break the record this time,” said Sutton.\r\n\r\nA somewhat pensive look came into Jimmy’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“She came much too quick for me,” he said. “I don’t see why they want to\r\nrip along at that pace,” he went on hurriedly. “I like to have a chance\r\nof enjoying the sea air.”\r\n\r\n“I know that sea air,” murmured Mifflin.\r\n\r\nJimmy looked up quickly.\r\n\r\n“What are you babbling about, Arthur?”\r\n\r\n“I said nothing,” replied Mifflin suavely.\r\n\r\n“What did you think of the show to-night, Jimmy?” asked Raikes.\r\n\r\n“I liked it. Arthur was fine. I can’t make out, though, why all this\r\nincense is being burned at the feet of the cracksman. To judge by some\r\nof the plays they produce now, you’d think that a man had only to be a\r\nsuccessful burglar to become a national hero. One of these days we shall\r\nhave Arthur playing Charles Peace to a cheering house.”\r\n\r\n“It is the tribute,” said Mifflin, “that boneheadedness pays to brains.\r\nIt takes brains to be a successful cracksman. Unless the grey matter is\r\nsurging about in your cerebrum, as in mine, you can’t hope——”\r\n\r\nJimmy leaned back in his chair and spoke calmly, but with decision.\r\n\r\n“Any man of ordinary intelligence,” he said, “could break into a house.”\r\n\r\nMifflin jumped up and began to gesticulate. This was heresy.\r\n\r\n“My dear old son, what absolute——”\r\n\r\n“I could,” said Jimmy, lighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter and approval. For the past few weeks,\r\nduring the rehearsals of _Love, the Cracksman_, Arthur Mifflin had\r\ndisturbed the peace at the Strollers’ with his theories on the art of\r\nburglary. This was his first really big part, and he had soaked himself\r\nin it. He had read up the literature of burglary. He had talked with\r\ndetectives. He had expounded his views nightly to his brother Strollers,\r\npreaching the delicacy and difficulty of cracking a crib till his\r\naudience had rebelled. It charmed the Strollers to find Jimmy, obviously\r\nof his own initiative, and not to be suspected of having been suborned\r\nto the task by themselves, treading with a firm foot on the expert’s\r\nfavourite corn within five minutes of their meeting.\r\n\r\n“You!” said Arthur Mifflin, with scorn.\r\n\r\n“Me—or, rather, I!”\r\n\r\n“You! Why, you couldn’t break into an egg unless it was a poached one.”\r\n\r\n“What’ll you bet?” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThe Strollers began to sit up and take notice. The magic word “bet”,\r\nwhen uttered in that room, had rarely failed to add a zest to life. They\r\nlooked expectantly to Arthur Mifflin.\r\n\r\n“Go to bed, Jimmy,” said the portrayer of cracksmen. “I’ll come with you\r\nand tuck you in. A nice, strong cup of tea in the morning, and you won’t\r\nknow there has ever been anything the matter with you.”\r\n\r\nA howl of disapproval rose from the company. Indignant voices accused\r\nArthur Mifflin of having a yellow streak. Encouraging voices urged him\r\nnot to be a quitter.\r\n\r\n“See! They scorn you!” said Jimmy. “And rightly. Be a man, Arthur.\r\nWhat’ll you bet?”\r\n\r\nMr. Mifflin regarded him with pity.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know what you’re taking on, Jimmy,” he said. “You’re half a\r\ncentury behind the times. You have an idea that all a burglar needs is a\r\nmask, a blue chin, and a dark lantern. I tell you he requires a highly\r\nspecialised education. I’ve been talking to these detective fellows, and\r\nI know. Now, take your case, you worm. Have you a thorough knowledge of\r\nchemistry, physics, toxicology——?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I have.”\r\n\r\n“Electricity and microscopy?”\r\n\r\n“You have discovered my secret.”\r\n\r\n“Can you use an oxyacetylene blow-pipe?”\r\n\r\n“I never travel without one.”\r\n\r\n“What do you know about the administration of anaesthetics?”\r\n\r\n“Practically everything. It is one of my favourite hobbies.”\r\n\r\n“Can you make soup?”\r\n\r\n“Soup?”\r\n\r\n“Soup,” said Mr. Mifflin firmly.\r\n\r\nJimmy raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Does an architect make bricks?” he said. “I leave the rough,\r\npreliminary work to my corps of assistants. They make my soup.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t think Jimmy’s one of your common cracksmen,” said Sutton.\r\n“He’s at the top of his profession. That’s how he made his money. I\r\nnever did believe that legacy story.”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy,” said Mr. Mifflin, “couldn’t crack a child’s money-box. Jimmy\r\ncouldn’t open a sardine-tin.” Jimmy shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“What’ll you bet?” he said again. “Come on, Arthur; you’re earning a\r\nvery good salary. What’ll you bet?”\r\n\r\n“Make it a dinner for all present,” suggested Raikes, a canny person who\r\nbelieved in turning the wayside happenings of life, when possible, to\r\nhis personal profit.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was well received.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Mifflin. “How many of us are there? One, two, three,\r\nfour. Loser buys a dinner for twelve.”\r\n\r\n“A good dinner,” interpolated Raikes softly.\r\n\r\n“A good dinner,” said Jimmy. “Very well. How long do you give me,\r\nArthur?”\r\n\r\n“How long do you want?”\r\n\r\n“There ought to be a time limit,” said Raikes. “It seems to me that an\r\nexpert like Jimmy ought to be able to manage it at short notice. Why not\r\nto-night? Nice, fine night. If Jimmy doesn’t crack a crib to-night, it’s\r\nup to him. That suit you, Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly.”\r\n\r\nWillett interposed. Willett had been endeavouring to drown his sorrows\r\nall the evening, and the fact was a little noticeable in his speech.\r\n\r\n“See here,” he said; “how’s J-Jimmy going to prove he’s done it?”\r\n\r\n“Personally, I can take his word,” said Mifflin.\r\n\r\n“That be h-hanged for a tale. Wha-what’s to prevent him saying he’s done\r\nit, whether he has or not?”\r\n\r\nThe Strollers looked uncomfortable. However, it was Jimmy’s affair.\r\n\r\n“Why, you’d get your dinner in any case,” said Jimmy. “A dinner from any\r\nhost would smell as sweet.”\r\n\r\nWillett persisted with muddled obstinacy.\r\n\r\n“Thash—thash not point. It’s principle of thin. Have thish thing square\r\nand ’bove-board, I say. Thash what I say.”\r\n\r\n“And very creditable to you being able to say it,” said Jimmy cordially.\r\n“See if you can manage ‘Truly rural.’”\r\n\r\n“What I say is this. Jimmy’s a fakir. And what I say is, what’s prevent\r\nhim saying he’s done it when hasn’t done it?”\r\n\r\n“That’ll be all right,” said Jimmy. “I’m going to bury a brass tube with\r\nthe Stars and Stripes in it under the carpet.”\r\n\r\n“Thash quite shfactory,” said Willett, with dignity.\r\n\r\n“Or, a better idea,” said Jimmy, “I’ll carve a big J on the inside of\r\nthe front door. Well, I’m off home. Anybody coming my way?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mifflin. “We’ll walk. First nights always make me as jumpy\r\nas a cat. If I don’t walk my legs off I shan’t get to sleep to-night at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“If you think I’m going to help you walk your legs off, my lad, you’re\r\nmistaken. I propose to stroll gently home and go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Every little helps,” said Mifflin. “Come along.”\r\n\r\n“You want to keep an eye on that man Jimmy, Arthur,” said Sutton. “He’d\r\nsand-bag you and lift your watch as soon as look at you. I believe he’s\r\nArsène Lupin in disguise.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 2 ★\r\n                      _The New Pyramus and Thisbe_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two men turned up the street. They walked in silence. Arthur Mifflin\r\nwas going over in his mind such outstanding events of the evening as he\r\nremembered—the nervousness, the relief of finding that he was gripping\r\nhis audience, the growing conviction that he had made good—while Jimmy\r\nseemed to be thinking his own private thoughts. They had gone some\r\ndistance before either spoke.\r\n\r\n“Who is she, Jimmy?” asked Mifflin.\r\n\r\nJimmy came out of his thoughts with a start.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Who is she?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you do! The sea air. Who is she?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Jimmy simply.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know? Well, what’s her name?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t the _Mauretania_ still print a passenger list?”\r\n\r\n“She does.”\r\n\r\n“And you couldn’t find out her name in five days?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“And that’s the man who thinks he can burgle a house!” said Mifflin\r\ndespairingly.\r\n\r\nThey had arrived now at the building on the second floor of which was\r\nJimmy’s flat.\r\n\r\n“Coming in?” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Well, I was rather thinking of pushing on as far as the park. I tell\r\nyou, I feel all on wires.”\r\n\r\n“Come in and smoke a cigar. You’ve got all night before you if you want\r\nto do Marathons. I haven’t seen you for a couple of months. I want you\r\nto tell me all the news.”\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any. Nothing happens in New York. The papers say things do,\r\nbut they don’t. However, I’ll come in. It seems to me that you’re the\r\nman with the news.”\r\n\r\nJimmy fumbled with his latch-key.\r\n\r\n“You’re a bright sort of burglar,” said Mifflin disparagingly. “Why\r\ndon’t you use your oxyacetylene blow-pipe? Do you realise, my boy, that\r\nyou’ve let yourself in for buying a dinner for twelve hungry men next\r\nweek? In the cold light of the morning, when Reason returns to her\r\nthrone, that’ll come home to you.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t done anything of the sort,” said Jimmy, unlocking the door.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me you really mean to try it.”\r\n\r\n“What else did you think I was going to do?”\r\n\r\n“But you can’t. You would get caught for a certainty. And what are you\r\ngoing to do then? Say it was all a joke? Suppose they fill you full of\r\nbullet-holes? Nice sort of fool you’ll look appealing to some outraged\r\nhouseholder’s sense of humour, while he pumps you full of lead with a\r\nColt!”\r\n\r\n“These are the risks of the profession. You ought to know that, Arthur.\r\nThink what you went through to-night.”\r\n\r\nArthur Mifflin looked at his friend with some uneasiness. He knew how\r\nentirely reckless he could be when he had set his mind on accomplishing\r\nanything. Jimmy, under the stimulus of a challenge, ceased to be a\r\nreasonable being, amenable to argument. And in the present case he knew\r\nthat Willett’s words had driven the challenge home. Jimmy was not the\r\nman to sit still under the charge of being a “fakir,” no matter whether\r\nhis accuser had been sober or drunk.\r\n\r\nJimmy, meanwhile, had produced whisky and cigars, and was lying on his\r\nback on the lounge, blowing smoke rings at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Arthur Mifflin at length.\r\n\r\n“Well? What?”\r\n\r\n“What I meant was, is this silence to be permanent, or are you going to\r\nbegin shortly to amuse, elevate, and instruct? Something’s happened to\r\nyou, Jimmy. There was a time when you were a bright little chap, a\r\nfellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. Where be your gibes\r\nnow, your gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment that were wont\r\nto set the table in a roar when you were paying for the dinner? You\r\nremind me more of a deaf-mute celebrating the Fourth of July with\r\nnoiseless powder than anything else on earth. Wake up, or I shall go.\r\nJimmy, we were boys together. Tell me about this girl—the girl you loved\r\nand were idiot enough to lose.”\r\n\r\nJimmy drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Mifflin complacently; “sigh if you like—it’s better\r\nthan nothing.”\r\n\r\nJimmy sat up.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dozens of times,” said Mifflin.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“You were just going to ask me if I had ever been in love, weren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t, because I know you haven’t. You have no soul. You don’t know\r\nwhat love is.”\r\n\r\n“Have it your own way,” said Mifflin resignedly.\r\n\r\nJimmy bumped back on to the sofa.\r\n\r\n“I don’t either,” he said. “That’s the trouble.”\r\n\r\nMifflin looked interested.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said. “You’ve got that strange premonitory fluttering, when\r\nthe heart seems to thrill within you like some baby bird singing its\r\nfirst song, when——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, shut up!”\r\n\r\n“When you ask yourself timidly, ‘Is it? Can it really be?’ and answer\r\nshyly, ‘No. Yes. I believe it is.’ I’ve been through it dozens of times.\r\nIt is a recognised early symptom. Unless prompt measures are taken it\r\nwill develop into something acute. In these matters stand on your Uncle\r\nArthur. He knows.”\r\n\r\n“You make me tired,” said Jimmy briefly.\r\n\r\n“You have our ear,” said Mifflin kindly. “Tell me all.”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing to tell.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t lie, James.”\r\n\r\n“Well, practically nothing.”\r\n\r\n“That’s better.”\r\n\r\n“It was like this.”\r\n\r\n“Good!”\r\n\r\nJimmy wriggled himself into a more comfortable position and took a sip\r\nfrom his glass.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t see her till the second day out.”\r\n\r\n“I know that second day out. Well?”\r\n\r\n“We didn’t really meet at all.”\r\n\r\n“Just happened to be going to the same spot, eh?”\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact, it was like this. Like a fool, I’d bought a\r\nsecond-class ticket.”\r\n\r\n“What? Our young Rockerbilt Astergould, the boy millionaire, travelling\r\nsecond-class! Why?”\r\n\r\n“I had an idea it would be better fun. Everybody’s so much more cheery\r\nin the second cabin. You get to know people so much quicker. Nine trips\r\nout of ten I’d much rather go second.”\r\n\r\n“And this was the tenth?”\r\n\r\n“She was in the first cabin,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nMifflin clutched his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” he cried. “This reminds me of something—something in\r\nShakespeare. Romeo and Juliet? No. I’ve got it!—Pyramus and Thisbe.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see the slightest resemblance.”\r\n\r\n“Read your _Midsummer Night’s Dream_. ‘Pyramus and Thisbe,’ says the\r\nstory, ‘did talk through the chink of a wall,’” quoted Mifflin.\r\n\r\n“We didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be so literal. You talked across a railing.”\r\n\r\n“We didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say you didn’t talk at all?”\r\n\r\n“We didn’t say a single word.”\r\n\r\nMifflin shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n“I give you up,” he said. “I thought you were a man of enterprise. What\r\ndid you do?”\r\n\r\nJimmy sighed softly.\r\n\r\n“I used to stand and smoke against the railing opposite the barber’s\r\nshop, and she used to walk round the deck.”\r\n\r\n“And you used to stare at her?”\r\n\r\n“I would look in her direction sometimes,” corrected Jimmy, with\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n“Don’t quibble! You stared at her. You behaved like a common\r\nrubber-neck, and you know it. I am no prude, James, but I feel compelled\r\nto say that I consider your conduct that of a libertine. Used she to\r\nwalk alone?”\r\n\r\n“Generally.”\r\n\r\n“And now you love her, eh? You went on board that ship happy, careless,\r\nheart-free. You came off it grave and saddened. Thenceforth for you the\r\nworld could contain but one woman, and her you had lost.”\r\n\r\nHe groaned in a hollow and bereaved manner, and took a sip from his\r\nglass to buoy him up.\r\n\r\nJimmy moved restlessly on the sofa.\r\n\r\n“Do you believe in love at first sight?” he asked fatuously. He was in\r\nthe mood when a man says things the memory of which makes him wake up\r\nhot all over for nights to come.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what first sight’s got to do with it,” said Mifflin.\r\n“According to your own statement, you stood and glared at the girl for\r\nfive days without stopping for a moment. I can quite imagine that you\r\nmight glare yourself into love with anyone by the end of that time.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t see myself settling down,” said Jimmy thoughtfully. “And until\r\nyou feel that you want to settle down, I suppose you can’t be really in\r\nlove.”\r\n\r\n“I was saying practically that about you at the club just before you\r\ncame in. My somewhat neat expression was that you were one of the\r\ngipsies of the world.”\r\n\r\n“By George, you’re quite right!”\r\n\r\n“I always am.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s having nothing to do. When I was on the _News_ I was\r\nnever like this.”\r\n\r\n“You weren’t on the _News_ long enough to get tired of it.”\r\n\r\n“I feel now I can’t stay in a place more than a week. It’s having this\r\nmoney that does it, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“New York,” said Mifflin, “is full of obliging persons who will be\r\ndelighted to relieve you of the incubus. Well, James, I shall leave you.\r\nI feel more like bed now. By the way, I suppose you lost sight of this\r\ngirl when you landed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there aren’t so many girls in the United States. Only twenty\r\nmillion. Or is it forty million? Something small. All you’ve got to do\r\nis to search about a bit. Good night.”\r\n\r\n“Good night.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mifflin clattered down the stairs. A minute later the sound of his\r\nname being called loudly from the street brought Jimmy to the window.\r\nMifflin was standing on the pavement below, looking up.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter now?”\r\n\r\n“I forgot to ask. Was she a blonde?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Was she a blonde?” yelled Mifflin.\r\n\r\n“No,” snapped Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Dark, eh?” bawled Mifflin, making night hideous.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jimmy, shutting the window.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy! I say, Jimmy!”\r\n\r\nThe window went up again.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I prefer blondes myself.”\r\n\r\n“Go to bed!”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Good night.”\r\n\r\n“Good night.”\r\n\r\nJimmy withdrew his head, and sat down on the chair Mifflin had vacated.\r\nA moment later he rose and switched off the light. It was pleasanter to\r\nsit and think in the dark. His thoughts wandered off in many channels,\r\nbut always came back to the girl on the _Mauretania_. It was absurd, of\r\ncourse. He didn’t wonder that Arthur Mifflin had treated the thing as a\r\njoke. Good old Arthur! Glad he had made a success. But was it a joke?\r\nWho was it said that the point of a joke was like the point of a\r\nneedle—so small that it is apt to disappear entirely when directed\r\nstraight at oneself? If anybody else had told him such a limping romance\r\nhe would have laughed himself. Only when you are the centre of a\r\nromance, however limping, you see it from a different angle. Of course,\r\ntold baldly, it was absurd. He could see that. But something right at\r\nthe back of his mind told him that it was not altogether absurd. And\r\nyet—— Love didn’t come like that—in a flash. You might just as well\r\nexpect a house to spring into being in a moment. Or a ship. Or an\r\nautomobile. Or a table. Or a—— He sat up with a jerk. In another instant\r\nhe would have been asleep.\r\n\r\nHe thought of bed, but bed seemed a long way off—the deuce of a way.\r\nAcres of carpet to be crawled over, and then the dickens of a climb at\r\nthe end of it. Besides undressing. Nuisance—undressing. That was a nice\r\ndress that girl had worn on the fourth day out. Tailor-made. He liked\r\ntailor-mades. He liked all her dresses. He liked her. Had she liked him?\r\nSo hard to tell if you don’t get a chance of speaking. She was dark.\r\nArthur liked blondes. Arthur was a fool! Good old Arthur! Glad he had\r\nmade a success! Now he could marry if he liked. If he wasn’t so\r\nrestless. If he didn’t feel that he couldn’t stop more than a day in any\r\nplace. But would the girl have him? If they had never spoken it made it\r\nso hard to——\r\n\r\nAt this point he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 3 ★\r\n                            _Mr. McEachern_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time when Jimmy slept in his chair, previous to being aroused\r\nfrom his slumbers by the invasion of Spike, a certain Mr. John\r\nMcEachern, Captain of Police was seated in the parlour of his up-town\r\nvilla, reading. He was a man built on a large scale. Everything about\r\nhim was large—his hands, his feet, his shoulders, his chest, and\r\nparticularly his jaw—which even in his moments of calm was aggressive,\r\nand which stood out, when anything happened to ruffle him, like the ram\r\nof a battleship. In his patrolman days, which had been passed mainly on\r\nthe East Side, this jaw of his had acquired a reputation from Park Row\r\nto Fourteenth Street. No gang-fight, however absorbing, could retain the\r\nundivided attention of the young blood of the Bowery when Mr.\r\nMcEachern’s jaw hove in sight, with the rest of his massive person in\r\nclose attendance. He was a man who knew no fear, and he had gone through\r\ndisorderly mobs like an east wind.\r\n\r\nBut there was another side to his character. In fact, that other side\r\nwas so large that the rest of him, his readiness in combat and his zeal\r\nin breaking up public disturbances, might be said to have been only an\r\noffshoot. For his ambition was as large as his fist and as aggressive as\r\nhis jaw. He had entered the Force with the single idea of becoming rich,\r\nand had set about achieving his object with a strenuous vigour that was\r\nas irresistible as his mighty locust-stick. Some policemen are born\r\ngrafters, some achieve graft, and some have graft thrust upon them. Mr.\r\nMcEachern had begun by being the first, had risen to the second, and for\r\nsome years now had been a prominent member of the small and\r\nhugely-prosperous third-class, the class which does not go out seeking\r\ngraft, but sits at home and lets graft come to them.\r\n\r\nThough neither his name nor his financial methods suggested it, Mr.\r\nMcEachern was by birth an English gentleman. His complete history would\r\ntake long to write. Abridged, it may be told as follows. His real name\r\nwas John Forrest, and he was the only son of one Eustace Forrest, at one\r\ntime a major in the Guards. His only other relative was Edward,\r\nEustace’s elder brother, a bachelor. When Mrs. Eustace died, four years\r\nafter the marriage, the widower, having spent eighteen months at Monte\r\nCarlo working out an infallible system for breaking the bank, to the\r\ngreat contentment of M. Blanc and the management in general, proceeded\r\nto the gardens, where he shot himself in the orthodox way, leaving many\r\nliabilities, no assets, and one son.\r\n\r\nEdward, by this time a man of substance in Lombard Street, adopted John,\r\nand sent him to a series of schools, beginning with a kindergarten and\r\nending with Eton.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Eton had demanded from John a higher standard of conduct\r\nthan he was prepared to supply, and a week after his eighteenth birthday\r\nhis career as an Etonian closed prematurely. Edward Forrest thereupon\r\ndelivered his ultimatum. John could choose between the smallest of small\r\nposts in his uncle’s business and £100 in bank-notes, coupled with the\r\nusual hand-washing and disowning. John had reached out for that money\r\nalmost before the words had left his uncle’s mouth. He left for\r\nLiverpool that day and for New York on the morrow.\r\n\r\nHe spent his hundred pounds, tried his hand without success at one or\r\ntwo odd jobs, and finally fell in with a friendly policeman, who,\r\nobserving the young man’s physique, which even then was impressive,\r\nsuggested that he should join the Force. The policeman, whose name was\r\nO’Flaherty, having talked the matter over with two other policemen whose\r\nnames were O’Rourke and Muldoon, strongly recommended that he should\r\nchange his name to something Irish, the better to equip him for his new\r\nprofession. Accordingly, John Forrest ceased to be and Patrolman J.\r\nMcEachern was born.\r\n\r\nIn his search for wealth he had been content to abide his time. He did\r\nnot want the trifling sum which every New York policeman acquires. His\r\nobject was something bigger, and he was prepared to wait for it. He knew\r\nthat small beginnings were an annoying but unavoidable preliminary to\r\nall great fortunes. Probably Captain Kidd had started in a small way.\r\nCertainly Mr. Rockefeller had. He was content to follow in the footsteps\r\nof the masters.\r\n\r\nA patrolman’s opportunities of amassing wealth are not great. Mr.\r\nMcEachern had made the best of a bad job. He had not disdained the\r\ndollars which came as single spies rather than in battalions. Until the\r\ntime should arrive when he might angle for whales he was prepared to\r\ncatch sprats.\r\n\r\nMuch may be done, even on a small scale, by perseverance. In those early\r\ndays Mr. McEachern’s observant eye had not failed to notice certain\r\npedlars who obstructed the traffic, divers tradesmen who did the same by\r\nthe pavement, and restaurant-keepers not a few with a distaste for\r\nclosing at one o’clock in the morning. His researches in this field were\r\nnot unprofitable. In a reasonably short space of time he had put by the\r\n$3,000 which were the price of his promotion to detective-sergeant. He\r\ndid not like paying $3,000 for promotion, but there must be sinking of\r\ncapital if an investment is to prosper. Mr. McEachern “came across”, and\r\nclimbed one more step up the ladder.\r\n\r\nAs detective-sergeant he found his horizon enlarged. There was more\r\nscope for a man of parts. Things moved more rapidly. The world seemed\r\nfull of philanthropists anxious to “dress his front” and do him other\r\nlittle kindnesses. Mr. McEachern was no churl. He let them dress his\r\nfront; he accepted the little kindnesses. Presently he found that he had\r\n$15,000 to spare for any small flutter that might take his fancy.\r\nSingularly enough, this was the precise sum necessary to make him a\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nHe became a captain. And it was then that he discovered that El Dorado\r\nwas no mere poet’s dream, and that Tom Tiddler’s Ground, where one might\r\nstand picking up gold and silver, was as definite a locality as Brooklyn\r\nor the Bronx. At last, after years of patient waiting, he stood like\r\nMoses on the mountain, looking down into the Promised Land. He had come\r\nto where the big money was.\r\n\r\nThe book he was reading now was the little note-book in which he kept a\r\nrecord of his investments, which were numerous and varied. That the\r\ncontents were satisfactory was obvious at a glance. The smile on his\r\nface, and the reposeful position of his jaw were proof enough of that.\r\nThere were notes relating to house property, railroad shares, and a\r\ndozen other profitable things. He was a rich man.\r\n\r\nThis was a fact which was entirely unsuspected by his neighbours, with\r\nwhom he maintained somewhat distant relations, accepting no invitations\r\nand giving none. For Mr. McEachern was playing a big game. Other eminent\r\nbuccaneers in his walk of life had been content to be rich men in a\r\ncommunity where moderate means were the rule. But about Mr. McEachern\r\nthere was a touch of the Napoleonic. He meant to get back into\r\nsociety—the society of England. Other people have noted the fact—which\r\nhad impressed itself very firmly on the policeman’s mind—that between\r\nEngland and the United States there are 3,000 miles of deep water. In\r\nthe United States he would be a retired police-captain; in England an\r\nAmerican gentleman of large and independent means with a beautiful\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThat was the ruling impulse in his life—his daughter Molly. Though, if\r\nhe had been a bachelor, he would certainly not have been satisfied to\r\npursue a humble career aloof from graft; on the other hand, if it had\r\nnot been for Molly he would not have felt, as he gathered in his\r\ndishonest wealth, that he was conducting a sort of Holy War. Ever since\r\nhis wife had died, in his detective-sergeant days, leaving him with a\r\nyear-old daughter, his ambitions had been inseparably connected with\r\nMolly.\r\n\r\nAll his thoughts were on the future. This New York life was only a\r\npreparation for the splendours to come. He spent not a dollar\r\nunnecessarily. When Molly was home from school they lived together\r\nsimply and quietly in the small house which Molly’s taste made so\r\ncomfortable. The neighbours, knowing his profession and seeing the\r\nmodest scale on which he lived, told each other that here, at any rate,\r\nwas a policeman whose hands were clean of graft. They did not know of\r\nthe stream that poured week by week and year by year into his bank, to\r\nbe diverted at intervals into the most profitable channels. Until the\r\ntime should come for the great change, economy was his motto. The\r\nexpenses of his home were kept within the bounds of his official salary.\r\nAll extras went to swell his savings.\r\n\r\nHe closed his book with a contented sigh and lit another cigar. Cigars\r\nwere his only personal luxury. He drank nothing, ate the simplest food,\r\nand made a suit of clothes last for quite an unusual length of time; but\r\nno passion for economy could make him deny himself smoke.\r\n\r\nHe sat on, thinking. It was very late, but he did not feel ready for\r\nbed. A great moment had arrived in his affairs. For days Wall Street had\r\nbeen undergoing one of its periodical fits of jumpiness. There had been\r\nrumours and counter-rumours, until finally from the confusion there had\r\nsoared up like a rocket the one particular stock in which he was most\r\nlargely interested. He had unloaded that morning, and the result had\r\nleft him slightly dizzy. The main point to which his mind clung was that\r\nthe time had come at last. He could make the great change now at any\r\nmoment that suited him.\r\n\r\nHe was blowing clouds of smoke and gloating over this fact when the door\r\nopened, admitting a bull-terrier, a bulldog, and in the wake of the\r\nprocession a girl in a kimono and red slippers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 4 ★\r\n                                _Molly_\r\n\r\n\r\n“Why, Molly,” said the policeman, “what are you doing out of bed? I\r\nthought you were asleep.”\r\n\r\nHe placed a huge arm round her and drew her on to his lap. As she sat\r\nthere his great bulk made her seem smaller than she really was. With her\r\nhair down, and her little red slippers dangling half a yard from the\r\nfloor, she seemed a child. McEachern, looking at her, found it hard to\r\nrealise that nineteen years had passed since the moment when the\r\ndoctor’s raised eyebrows had reproved him for his monosyllabic reception\r\nof the news that the baby was a girl.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what the time is?” he said. “Two o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Much too late for you to be sitting here smoking,” said Molly severely.\r\n“How many cigars do you smoke a day? Suppose you had married some one\r\nwho wouldn’t let you smoke!”\r\n\r\n“Never stop your husband smoking, my dear. That’s a bit of advice for\r\nyou when you’re married.”\r\n\r\n“I’m never going to marry. I’m going to stop at home and darn your\r\nsocks.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you could,” he said, drawing her closer to him. “But one of\r\nthese days you’re going to marry a prince. And now run back to bed. It’s\r\nmuch too late——”\r\n\r\n“It’s no good, father dear. I couldn’t get to sleep. I’ve been trying\r\nhard for hours. I’ve counted sheep till I nearly screamed. It’s Rastus’s\r\nfault; he snores so.”\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern regarded the erring bulldog sternly.\r\n\r\n“Why do you have the brutes in your room?”\r\n\r\n“Why, to keep the boogaboos from getting me of course. Aren’t you afraid\r\nof the boogaboos getting you? But you’re so big, you wouldn’t mind.\r\nYou’d just hit them. And they’re not brutes—are you, darlings? You’re\r\nangels, and you nearly burst yourselves with joy because auntie had come\r\nback from England, didn’t you? Father, did they miss me when I was gone?\r\nDid they pine away?”\r\n\r\n“They got like skeletons. We all did.”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“I should say so.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you send me away?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted you to see the country. Did you like it?”\r\n\r\n“I hated being away from you.”\r\n\r\n“But you liked the country?”\r\n\r\n“I loved it.”\r\n\r\nMcEachern drew a breath of relief. The only possible obstacle to the\r\ngreat change did not exist.\r\n\r\n“How would you like to go back to England, Molly?”\r\n\r\n“To England. When I’ve just come home?”\r\n\r\n“If I went, too?”\r\n\r\nMolly twisted round so that she could see his face better.\r\n\r\n“There’s something the matter with you, father. You’re trying to say\r\nsomething, and I want to know what it is. Tell me quick, or I’ll make\r\nRastus bite you!”\r\n\r\n“It won’t take long, dear. I’ve been lucky in some investments while you\r\nwere away, and I’m going to leave the Force, and take you over to\r\nEngland and find a prince for you to marry—if you think you would like\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Father! It’ll be perfectly splendid!”\r\n\r\nShe kissed him.\r\n\r\n“What are you looking so thoughtful about, father?”\r\n\r\n“Molly, I want to tell you something I have never told you before. I am\r\nEnglish. I only took the name McEachern because they thought it would\r\nhelp me in the Force. Our real name is Forrest.”\r\n\r\n“Father! But why haven’t you ever told me before?”\r\n\r\n“I was afraid you might ask questions and find out things.”\r\n\r\nShe looked quickly at him.\r\n\r\n“I was sent to America,” he went on, “because I was expelled from school\r\nfor stealing.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. She caught the arm that was round her waist and\r\ngave it a little squeeze.\r\n\r\n“What does it matter what you did when you were only a boy?” she said.\r\n\r\nHe did not look at her. There was a dull flush on his cheeks.\r\n\r\n“We’ll go home, Molly,” he said. “I had a place in society over there\r\ntill I threw it away, and, by Heaven, I’m going to get it back for you.\r\nYou shall have a fair show, whatever I may have done. We shall not take\r\nthe old name again. None of the return of the black sheep for me! I\r\nwon’t have people looking down on you because your father——”\r\n\r\n“But, father dear, it was so long ago. What does it matter? Who would\r\nremember?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind. I couldn’t risk it. They might say what they pleased about\r\nme, but you’re going to start fair. Who’s to recognise me after all\r\nthese years? I’m just John McEachern from America, and if anybody wants\r\nto know anything about me, I’m a man who has made money on Wall\r\nStreet—and that’s no lie—and has come over to England to spend it.”\r\nMolly gave his arm another squeeze. Her eyes were wet.\r\n\r\n“Father dear,” she whispered, “I believe you’ve been doing it all for\r\nme. You’ve been slaving away for me ever since I was born, stinting\r\nyourself and saving money just so that I could have a good time later\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“No, no!”\r\n\r\n“It’s true,” she said. She turned on him with a tremulous laugh. “I\r\ndon’t believe you’ve had enough to eat for years. I believe you’re all\r\nskin and bone. Never mind. To-morrow I’ll take you out and buy you the\r\nbest dinner you’ve ever had out of my own money. We’ll go to the Ritz,\r\nand you shall start at the top of the menu and go straight down till\r\nyou’ve had enough.”\r\n\r\n“That will make up for everything. And now don’t you think you ought to\r\nbe going to bed? You’ll be losing all that color you got on the ship.”\r\n\r\n“Soon. Not just yet. I haven’t seen you for such ages.” She pointed at\r\nthe bull-terrier. “Look at Tommy, standing there and staring. He can’t\r\nbelieve I’ve really come back. Father, there was a man on the\r\n_Mauretania_ with eyes exactly like Tommy’s—all brown and bright—and he\r\nused to stand and stare just like Tommy’s doing.”\r\n\r\n“If I had been there,” said her father wrathfully, “I’d have knocked his\r\nhead off.”\r\n\r\n“No, you wouldn’t, because I’m sure he was really a very nice young man.\r\nHe had a chin rather like yours, father. Besides, you couldn’t have got\r\nat him to knock his head off, because he was travelling second-class.”\r\n\r\n“Second-class? Then you didn’t talk with him?”\r\n\r\n“We couldn’t. You wouldn’t expect him to shout at me across the railing!\r\nOnly whenever I walked round the deck he seemed to be there.”\r\n\r\n“Staring?”\r\n\r\n“He may not have been staring at me. Probably he was just looking the\r\nway the ship was going, and thinking of some girl in New York. I don’t\r\nthink you can make much of a romance out of it, father.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to, my dear. Princes don’t travel in the second cabin.”\r\n\r\n“He may have been a prince in disguise.”\r\n\r\n“More likely a commercial traveller,” grunted Mr. McEachern.\r\n\r\n“Commercial travellers are often quite nice.”\r\n\r\n“Princes are nicer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll go to bed and dream of the nicest one I can think of. Come\r\nalong, dogs. Stop biting my slipper, Tommy. Why can’t you behave like\r\nRastus? Still, you don’t snore, do you? Aren’t you going to bed soon,\r\nfather? I believe you’ve been sitting up late and getting into all sorts\r\nof bad habits while I’ve been away. I’m sure you have been smoking too\r\nmuch. When you’ve finished that cigar you’re not even to think of\r\nanother till to-morrow. Promise!”\r\n\r\n“Not one!”\r\n\r\n“Not one. I’m not going to have my father getting like the people you\r\nread about in the magazine advertisements. You don’t want to feel sudden\r\nshooting pains, do you?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“And have to take some awful medicine?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then promise.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, my dear. I promise.”\r\n\r\nAs the door closed he threw away the stump he was smoking, and remained\r\nfor a few moments in thought.\r\n\r\nThen he drew another cigar from his case, lit it, and resumed the study\r\nof the little note-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 5 ★\r\n                         _A Thief in the Night_\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long the light had been darting about the room like a\r\nvery-much-enlarged firefly Jimmy did not know. It seemed to him like\r\nhours, for it had woven itself into an incoherent waking dream of his;\r\nand for a moment, as the mists of sleep passed away from his brain, he\r\nfancied that he was dreaming still. Then sleep left him, and he realised\r\nthat the light, which was now moving slowly across the bookcase, was a\r\nreal light.\r\n\r\nThat the man behind it could not have been there long was plain, or he\r\nwould have seen the chair and its occupant. He seemed to be taking the\r\nroom step by step. As Jimmy sat up noiselessly, and gripped the arms of\r\nthe chair in readiness for a spring, the light passed from the bookcase\r\nto the table. Another foot or so to the left, and it would have fallen\r\non Jimmy.\r\n\r\nOn it came. From the position of the ray Jimmy could see that the\r\nburglar was approaching on his side of the table. Though, until that\r\nday, he had not been in the room for two months, its geography was\r\nclearly stamped on his mind’s eye. He knew almost to a foot where his\r\nvisitor was standing. Consequently when, rising swiftly from the chair\r\nhe made a football dive into the darkness, it was no speculative dive.\r\nIt had a conscious aim, and it was not restrained by any uncertainty as\r\nto whether the road to the burglar’s knees was clear or not.\r\n\r\nHis shoulder bumped into a human leg. His arms closed instantaneously on\r\nit and pulled. There was a yelp of dismay and a crash. The lantern\r\nbounced away across the room and wrecked itself on the roof of the\r\nsteam-heater. Its owner collapsed in a heap on top of Jimmy.\r\n\r\nJimmy, underneath at the fall, speedily put himself uppermost with a\r\ntwist of his body. He had every advantage. The burglar was a small man,\r\nand had been taken very much by surprise, and any fight there might have\r\nbeen in him in normal circumstances had been shaken out of him by the\r\nfall. He lay still, not attempting to struggle.\r\n\r\nJimmy half rose and, pulling his prisoner by inches to the door, felt up\r\nthe wall till he found the electric-light button.\r\n\r\nThe yellow glow which flooded the room disclosed a short, stocky youth\r\nof obviously Bowery extraction. A shock of vivid red hair was the first\r\nthing about him that caught the eye. A poet would have described it as\r\nTitian. Its proprietor’s friends and acquaintances probably called it\r\n“carrots”. Looking up at Jimmy from under this wealth of crimson was a\r\nnot unpleasing face. It was not handsome certainly, but there were\r\nsuggestions of a latent good-humour. The nose had been broken at one\r\nperiod of its career, and one of the ears was undeniably of the\r\ncauliflower type; but these are little accidents which may happen to any\r\nhigh-spirited young gentleman. In costume the visitor had evidently been\r\nguided rather by individual taste than by the dictates of fashion. His\r\ncoat was of rusty-black, his trousers of grey, picked out with stains of\r\nvarious colours. Beneath the coat was a faded red-and-white sweater. A\r\nhat of soft felt lay on the floor by the table.\r\n\r\nThe cut of the coat was poor, and the sit of it spoiled by a bulge in\r\none of the pockets. Diagnosing this bulge correctly, Jimmy inserted his\r\nhand and drew out a dingy revolver.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he said, rising.\r\n\r\nLike most people, he had often wondered what he should do if he were to\r\nmeet a burglar; and he had always come to the conclusion that curiosity\r\nwould be his chief emotion. His anticipations had proved perfectly\r\ncorrect. Now that he had abstracted his visitor’s gun he had no wish to\r\ndo anything but engage him in conversation. A burglar’s life was\r\nsomething so entirely outside his experience. He wanted to learn the\r\nburglar’s point of view. Incidentally, he reflected with amusement, as\r\nhe recalled his wager, he might pick up a few useful hints.\r\n\r\nThe man on the floor sat up and rubbed the back of his head ruefully.\r\n\r\n“Gee!” he muttered. “I t’ought some guy had t’rown de building at me.”\r\n\r\n“It was only little me,” said Jimmy. “Sorry if I hurt you at all. You\r\nreally want a mat for that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nThe man’s hand went furtively to his pocket. Then his eye caught sight\r\nof the revolver, which Jimmy had placed on the table. With a sudden dash\r\nhe seized it.\r\n\r\n“Now den, boss!” he said, between his teeth.\r\n\r\nJimmy extended his hand towards him and unclasped it. Six cartridges lay\r\nin the palm.\r\n\r\n“Why worry?” he said. “Sit down and let us talk of life.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a fair cop, boss,” said the man resignedly.\r\n\r\n“Away with melancholy,” said Jimmy. “I’m not going to call the police.\r\nYou can go whenever you like.”\r\n\r\nThe man stared.\r\n\r\n“I mean it,” said Jimmy. “What’s the trouble? I’ve no grievance. I wish,\r\nthough, if you haven’t any important engagement, you would stop and talk\r\nawhile first.”\r\n\r\nA broad grin spread itself across the other’s face. There was something\r\nsingularly engaging about him when he grinned.\r\n\r\n“Gee! If youse ain’t goin’ to call de cops, I’ll talk till de chickens\r\nroost again.”\r\n\r\n“Talking, however,” said Jimmy, “is dry work. Are you a teetotaller?”\r\n\r\n“What’s dat? Me? On your way, boss!”\r\n\r\n“Then you’ll find a pretty decent whisky in that decanter. Help\r\nyourself. I think you’ll like it.”\r\n\r\nA musical gurgling, followed by a contented sigh, showed that the\r\nstatement had been tested and proved correct.\r\n\r\n“Cigar?” asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Me fer dat,” assented his visitor.\r\n\r\n“Take a handful.”\r\n\r\n“I eats dem alive,” said the marauder jovially, gathering in the spoils.\r\n\r\nJimmy crossed his legs.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” he said, “let there be no secrets between us. What’s your\r\nname? Mine is Pitt—James Willoughby Pitt.”\r\n\r\n“Mullins is my monaker, boss. Spike, dey calls me.”\r\n\r\n“And you make a living at this sort of thing?”\r\n\r\n“Not so bad.”\r\n\r\n“How did you get in here?”\r\n\r\nSpike Mullins grinned.\r\n\r\n“Gee! Ain’t de window open?”\r\n\r\n“If it hadn’t been?”\r\n\r\n“I’d a’ busted it.”\r\n\r\nJimmy eyed him fixedly.\r\n\r\n“Can you use an oxyacetylene blow-pipe?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nSpike was on the point of drinking. He lowered his glass and gaped.\r\n\r\n“What’s dat?” he said.\r\n\r\n“An oxyacetylene blow-pipe.”\r\n\r\n“Search me,” said Spike blankly. “Dat gets past me.”\r\n\r\nJimmy’s manner grew more severe.\r\n\r\n“Can you make soup?”\r\n\r\n“Soup, boss?”\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t know what soup is,” said Jimmy despairingly. “My good man,\r\nI’m afraid you have missed your vocation. You have no business to be\r\ntrying to burgle. You don’t know the first thing about the game.”\r\n\r\nSpike was regarding him with furtive disquiet over his glass. Till now\r\nthe red-haired one had been very well satisfied with his methods, but\r\ncriticism was beginning to sap his nerve. He had heard tales of masters\r\nof his craft who made use of fearsome implements such as Jimmy had\r\nmentioned; burglars who had an airy acquaintanceship, bordering on\r\ninsolent familiarity, with the marvels of science; men to whom the\r\nlatest inventions were as familiar as his own jemmy was to himself.\r\nCould this be one of that select band? Jimmy began to take on a new\r\naspect in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Spike,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Huh!”\r\n\r\n“Have you a thorough knowledge of chemistry, physics——”\r\n\r\n“On your way, boss!”\r\n\r\n“Toxicology——”\r\n\r\n“Search me!”\r\n\r\n“Electricity and microscopy?”\r\n\r\n“Nine, ten. Dat’s de finish. I’m down and out.”\r\n\r\nJimmy shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n“Give up burglary,” he said. “It’s not in your line. Better try\r\npoultry-farming.”\r\n\r\nSpike twiddled his glass, abashed.\r\n\r\n“Now I,” said Jimmy airily, “am thinking of breaking into a house\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\n“Gee!” exclaimed Spike, his suspicions confirmed at last. “I t’ought\r\nyouse was in de game, boss. Sure, you’re de guy dat’s onto all de\r\ncurves. I t’ought so all along.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to hear,” said Jimmy amusedly, as one who draws out an\r\nintelligent child, “how you would set about burgling one of those\r\nup-town villas. My own work has been on a somewhat larger scale and on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic.”\r\n\r\n“De odder side?”\r\n\r\n“I have done as much in London as anywhere else,” said Jimmy. “A great\r\ntown, London. Full of opportunities for the fine worker. Did you hear of\r\nthe cracking of the new Asiatic Bank in Lombard Street?”\r\n\r\n“No, boss,” whispered Spike. “Was dat you?”\r\n\r\n“The police would like an answer to the same question,” he said\r\nself-consciously. “Perhaps you heard nothing of the disappearance of the\r\nDuchess of Havent’s diamonds?”\r\n\r\n“Was dat——?”\r\n\r\n“The thief,” said Jimmy, flicking a speck of dust from his coat-sleeve,\r\n“was discovered to have used an oxyacetylene blow-pipe.”\r\n\r\nThe rapturous intake of Spike’s breath was the only sound that broke the\r\nsilence. Through the smoke his eyes could be seen slowly widening.\r\n\r\n“But about this villa,” said Jimmy. “I am always interested even in the\r\nhumblest sides of the profession. Now, tell me, supposing you were going\r\nto break into a villa, what time of night would you do it?”\r\n\r\n“I always t’inks it’s best either late like dis or when de folks is in\r\nat supper,” said Spike respectfully.\r\n\r\nJimmy smiled a faint, patronizing smile, and nodded.\r\n\r\n“Well, and what would you do?”\r\n\r\n“I’d rubber around some to see isn’t dere a window open somewheres,”\r\nsaid Spike diffidently.\r\n\r\n“And if there wasn’t?”\r\n\r\n“I’d climb up de porch and into one of de bedrooms,” said Spike, almost\r\nblushing. He felt like a boy reading his first attempts at original\r\npoetry to an established critic. What would this master cracksman, this\r\npolished wielder of the oxyacetylene blow-pipe, this expert in\r\ntoxicology, microscopy, and physics, think of his callow outpourings?\r\n\r\n“How would you get into the bedroom?”\r\n\r\nSpike hung his head.\r\n\r\n“Bust de catch wit me jemmy,” he whispered shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n“Burst the catch with your jemmy?”\r\n\r\n“It’s de only way I ever learned,” pleaded Spike.\r\n\r\nThe expert was silent. He seemed to be thinking. The other watched his\r\nface humbly.\r\n\r\n“How would youse do it, boss?” he ventured timidly, at last.\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“How would youse do it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’m not sure,” said the master graciously, “whether your way might\r\nnot do in a case like that. It’s crude, of course, but with a few\r\nchanges it would do.”\r\n\r\n“Gee, boss! Is dat right?” queried the astonished disciple.\r\n\r\n“It would do,” said the master, frowning thoughtfully. “It would do\r\nquite well—quite well.”\r\n\r\nSpike drew a deep breath of joy and astonishment. That his methods\r\nshould meet with approval from such a mind!\r\n\r\n“Gee!” he whispered. As who should say, “I am Napoleon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 6 ★\r\n                      _An Exhibition Performance_\r\n\r\n\r\nCold reason may disapprove of wagers, but without a doubt there is\r\nsomething joyous and lovable in the type of mind which rushes at the\r\nleast provocation into the making of them, something smacking of the\r\nspacious days of the Regency. Nowadays the spirit seems to have deserted\r\nEngland. When Mr. Lloyd George became Premier of Great Britain no\r\nearnest forms were to be observed rolling pea-nuts along the Strand with\r\na toothpick. When Mr. George is dethroned it is improbable that any\r\nBriton will allow his beard to remain unshaved until his pet party\r\nreturns to office. It is in the United States that the wager has found a\r\nhome. It is characteristic of some minds to dash into a wager with the\r\nfearlessness of a soldier in a forlorn hope, and, once in, to regard it\r\nalmost as a sacred trust. Some men never grow up out of the schoolboy\r\nspirit of “daring”.\r\n\r\nTo this class Jimmy Pitt belonged. He was of the same type as the man in\r\nthe comic opera who proposed to the lady because somebody bet him he\r\nwouldn’t. There had never been a time when a challenge, a “dare”, had\r\nnot acted as a spur to him. In his newspaper days life had been one long\r\nseries of challenges. They had been the essence of the business. A story\r\nhad not been worth getting unless the getting were difficult.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of his newspaper life came a certain flatness into\r\nthe scheme of things. There were times, many times, when Jimmy was\r\nbored. He hungered for excitement, and life appeared to have so little\r\nto offer. The path of the rich man was so smooth, and it seemed to lead\r\nnowhere. This task of burgling a house was like an unexpected treat to a\r\nchild. With an intensity of purpose which should have touched his sense\r\nof humour, but which, as a matter of fact, did not appeal to him as\r\nludicrous in any way, he addressed himself to the work. The truth was\r\nthat Jimmy was one of those men who are charged to the brim with force.\r\nSomehow the force had to find an outlet. If he had undertaken to collect\r\nbirds’ eggs, he would have set about it with the same tense energy.\r\n\r\nSpike was sitting on the edge of his chair, dazed but happy, his head\r\nstill buzzing from the unhoped-for praise. Jimmy looked at his watch. It\r\nwas nearly three o’clock. A sudden idea struck him. The gods had\r\nprovided gifts—why not take them?\r\n\r\n“Spike!”\r\n\r\n“Huh?”\r\n\r\n“Would you care to come and crack a crib with me now?”\r\n\r\n“Gee, boss!”\r\n\r\n“Would you?”\r\n\r\n“Surest t’ing you know, boss.”\r\n\r\n“Or, rather,” proceeded Jimmy, “would you care to crack a crib while I\r\ncome along with you? Strictly speaking, I am here on vacation, but a\r\ntrifle like this isn’t real work. It’s this way,” he explained. “I’ve\r\ntaken a fancy to you, Spike, and I don’t like to see you wasting your\r\ntime on coarse work. You have the root of the matter in you, and with a\r\nlittle coaching I could put a polish on you. I wouldn’t do this for\r\nevery one, but I hate to see a man bungling who might do better! I want\r\nto see you at work. Come right along and we’ll go up-town and you shall\r\nstart in. Don’t get nervous. Just work as you would if I were not there.\r\nI shall not expect too much. Rome was not built in a day. When we are\r\nthrough I will criticise a few of your mistakes. How does that suit\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Gee, boss! Great! And say, I knows just de places. A friend of mine\r\nputs me wise to it. Leastways, I didn’t know he was me friend, but I\r\nfalls for him now. It’s a——”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then. One moment, though.”\r\n\r\nHe went to the telephone. Before he had left New York on his travels,\r\nArthur Mifflin had been living at an hotel near Washington Square. It\r\nwas probable that he was still there. He called up the number. The\r\nnight-clerk was an old acquaintance of his.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Dixon!” said Jimmy, “is that you? I’m Pitt. Pitt. Yes. I’m back.\r\nHow did you guess? Yes, very pleasant, thanks. Has Mr. Mifflin come in\r\nyet? Gone to bed? Never mind, ring him up, will you? Thanks.” Presently\r\nthe sleepy and outraged voice of Mr. Mifflin spoke at the other end of\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong? Who the devil’s that?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Arthur! Where you pick up such expressions I can’t think. Not\r\nfrom me.”\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Jimmy? What in the name of——”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! what are you kicking about? The night’s yet young. Arthur,\r\ntouching that little arrangement we made—cracking that crib, you know.\r\nAre you listening? Have you any objection to my taking an assistant\r\nalong with me? I don’t want to do anything contrary to our agreement,\r\nbut there’s a young fellow here who’s anxious that I should let him come\r\nalong and pick up a few hints. He’s a professional all right. Not in our\r\nclass, of course, but quite a fair rough workman. He——Arthur! Arthur!\r\nThese are harsh words! Then am I to understand you have no objection?\r\nVery well. Only don’t say later on that I didn’t play fair. Good night.”\r\n\r\nHe hung up the receiver and turned to Spike.\r\n\r\n“Ready?”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t youse goin’ to put on your gum-shoes, boss?”\r\n\r\nJimmy frowned reflectively, as if there was something in what this\r\nnovice suggested. He went into the bedroom, and returned wearing a pair\r\nof thin patent leather shoes.\r\n\r\nSpike coughed tentatively.\r\n\r\n“Won’t youse need your gun?” he hazarded.\r\n\r\nJimmy gave a short laugh.\r\n\r\n“I work with my brains, not guns,” he said. “Let us be going.”\r\n\r\nThere was a taxi-cab near by, as there always is in New York. Jimmy\r\npushed Spike in.\r\n\r\nThe luxury of riding in a taxi-cab kept Spike dumb for several miles. At\r\nOne Hundred and Fiftieth Street Jimmy stopped the cab and paid the\r\ndriver, who took the money with that magnificently aloof air which\r\ncharacterizes the taxi-chauffeur. A lesser man might have displayed some\r\ncuriosity about the ill-matched pair. The chauffeur, having lit a\r\ncigarette, drove off without any display of interest whatsoever. It\r\nmight have been part of his ordinary duties to drive gentlemen in\r\nevening clothes and shock-headed youths in parti-coloured sweaters about\r\nthe city at three o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n“We will now,” said Jimmy, “stroll on and prospect. It might excite\r\ncomment if we drove up to the door. It is up to you, Spike. Lead me to\r\nthis house you mentioned.”\r\n\r\nThey walked on, striking eastward out of Broadway. It caused Jimmy some\r\nsurprise to find that much-enduring thoroughfare extended as far as\r\nthis. It had never occurred to him before to ascertain what Broadway did\r\nwith itself beyond Times Square. He had spent much of his time abroad,\r\nin cities where a street changes its name every hundred yards or so\r\nwithout any apparent reason.\r\n\r\nIt was darker now that they had moved from the centre of things, but it\r\nwas still far too light for Jimmy’s tastes. He was content, however, to\r\nleave matters entirely in his companion’s charge. Spike probably had his\r\nmethod for evading publicity on these occasions.\r\n\r\nSpike, meanwhile, plodded steadily onwards. Block after block he passed,\r\nuntil finally the houses began to be more scattered.\r\n\r\nAt length he stopped outside a fair-sized detached house. As he did so a\r\nsingle rain-drop descended with a splash on the nape of Jimmy’s neck. In\r\nanother moment the shower had begun—jerkily at first, then, as if\r\nwarming to its work, with the quiet persistence of a shower-bath.\r\n\r\n“Dis is de place, boss,” said Spike.\r\n\r\nFrom a burglar’s point of view it was an admirable house. It had no\r\nporch, but there was a handy window only a few feet from the ground.\r\nSpike pulled from his pocket a small bottle and a piece of coarse paper.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” inquired Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Treacle, boss,” said Spike deferentially.\r\n\r\nHe poured the contents of the bottle on to the paper, which he pressed\r\nfirmly against the window-pane. Then, drawing out a short steel\r\ninstrument, he gave the paper a sharp tap. The glass beneath broke,\r\nthough the sound was almost inaudible. The paper came away with the\r\nglass attached, then Spike inserting his hand in the opening, shot back\r\nthe catch and softly pushed up the window.\r\n\r\n“Elementary,” said Jimmy; “elementary, but quite neat.”\r\n\r\nThere was now a shutter to be negotiated. This took longer, but in the\r\nend Spike’s persuasive methods prevailed.\r\n\r\nJimmy became quite cordial.\r\n\r\n“You have been well grounded, Spike,” he said. “And, after all, that is\r\nhalf the battle. The advice I give to every novice is, ‘Learn to walk\r\nbefore you try to run.’ Master the A B C of the craft first. With a\r\nlittle careful coaching you will do. Just so. Pop in.”\r\n\r\nSpike climbed cautiously over the sill, followed by Jimmy. The latter\r\nstruck a match and found the electric light switch. They were in a\r\nparlour furnished and decorated with surprising taste. Jimmy had\r\nexpected the usual hideousness, but here everything, from the wall-paper\r\nto the smallest ornaments, was wonderfully well selected.\r\n\r\nBusiness, however, was business. This was no time to stand admiring\r\nartistic efforts in room-furnishing. There was that big J to be carved\r\non the front door. If ’twere done, then ’twere well ’twere done quickly.\r\n\r\nHe was just moving to the door, when from some distant part of the house\r\ncame the bark of a dog. Another joined in. The solo became a duet. The\r\nair was filled with their clamour.\r\n\r\n“Gee!” cried Spike.\r\n\r\nThe remark seemed more or less to sum up the situation.\r\n\r\n“’Tis sweet,” says Byron, “to hear the watch-dog’s honest bark.” Jimmy\r\nand Spike found two watch-dogs’ honest barks cloying. Spike intimated\r\nthis by making a feverish dash for the open window. Unfortunately for\r\nthe success of this manoeuvre, the floor of the room was covered, not\r\nwith a carpet, but with tastefully scattered rugs, and underneath these\r\nrugs it was very highly polished. Spike, treading on one of these\r\nislands, was instantly undone. No power of will or muscle can save a man\r\nin such a case. Spike skidded. His feet flew from under him. There was a\r\nmomentary flash of red hair, as of a passing meteor. The next moment he\r\nhad fallen on his back with a thud which shook the house, and probably\r\nthe rest of Manhattan Island as well. Even in that crisis the thought\r\nflashed across Jimmy’s mind that this was not Spike’s lucky night.\r\n\r\nUpstairs the efforts of the canine choir had begun to resemble the “A\r\nche la morte” duet in _Il Trovatore_. Particularly good work was being\r\ndone by the baritone dog.\r\n\r\nSpike sat up, groaning. Equipped though he was by nature with a skull of\r\nthe purest and most solid ivory, the fall had disconcerted him. His\r\neyes, like those of Shakespeare’s poet, rolling a fine frenzy, did\r\nglance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven. He passed his fingers\r\ntenderly through his vermilion hair.\r\n\r\nHeavy footsteps were descending the stairs. In the distance the soprano\r\ndog had reached A in alto and was holding it, while his fellow-artiste\r\nexecuted runs in the lower register.\r\n\r\n“Get up!” hissed Jimmy. “There’s somebody coming! Get up, you idiot,\r\ncan’t you?”\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Jimmy that it never even occurred to him to\r\ndesert the fallen one and depart alone. There was once an Italian\r\nconvict who, in planning a jail-breaking, assigned to his brother felons\r\nsuch duties as shooting the governor and strangling the warders,\r\nreserving for himself the task of making “da gran’ escape”. Jimmy was\r\nthe exact opposite of this strategist. Spike was his brother-in-arms. He\r\nwould as soon have thought of deserting him as a sea-captain would have\r\nabandoned his ship.\r\n\r\nConsequently, as Spike, despite all exhortations, continued to remain on\r\nthe floor, rubbing his head and uttering “Gee!” at intervals in a\r\nmelancholy voice, Jimmy resigned himself to fate, and stood where he\r\nwas, waiting for the door to open.\r\n\r\nIt opened the next moment as if a cyclone had been behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 7 ★\r\n                          _Getting Acquainted_\r\n\r\n\r\nA cyclone entering the room is apt to alter the position of things. This\r\none shifted a footstool, a small chair, a rug, and Spike. The chair\r\nstruck by a massive boot, whirled against the wall. The footstool rolled\r\naway. The rug crumpled up and slid. Spike, with a yell, leaped to his\r\nfeet, slipped again, fell, and finally compromised on an all-fours\r\nposition, in which attitude he remained, blinking.\r\n\r\nWhile these stirring acts were in progress there was the sound of a door\r\nopening upstairs, followed by a scuttering of feet and an appalling\r\nincrease in the canine contribution to the current noises. The duet had\r\nnow taken on quite a Wagnerian effect.\r\n\r\nThere raced into the room first a white bull-terrier, he of the soprano\r\nvoice, and—a bad second—his fellow-artiste, the baritone, a massive\r\nbulldog, bearing a striking resemblance to the big man with the\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in theatrical parlance, the entire company “held the picture”.\r\nUp-stage, with his hand still on the door, stood the large householder;\r\ndown-stage Jimmy. Centre, Spike and the bulldog, their noses, a couple\r\nof inches apart, inspected each other with mutual disfavour. On the\r\nextreme O.P. side the bull-terrier, who had fallen foul of a wickerwork\r\ntable, was crouching with extended tongue and rolling eyes, waiting for\r\nthe next move.\r\n\r\nThe householder looked at Jimmy. Jimmy looked at the householder. Spike\r\nand the bulldog looked at each other. The bull-terrier distributed his\r\ngaze impartially around the company.\r\n\r\n“A typical scene of quiet American home-life,” murmured Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThe man with the pistol glowered.\r\n\r\n“Hands up, you devils!” he roared, pointing a mammoth revolver.\r\n\r\nThe two marauders humoured his whim.\r\n\r\n“Let me explain,” said Jimmy pacifically, shuffling warily round in\r\norder to face the bull-terrier, who was now strolling in his direction\r\nwith an ill-assumed carelessness.\r\n\r\n“Keep still, you blackguard!”\r\n\r\nJimmy kept still. The bull-terrier, with the same abstracted air, was\r\nbeginning a casual inspection of his right trouser-leg.\r\n\r\nRelations between Spike and the bulldog, meanwhile, had become more\r\nstrained. The sudden flinging up of the former’s arms had had the worst\r\neffect on the animal’s nerves. Spike, the croucher on all-fours, he\r\nmight have tolerated; but Spike, the semaphore, inspired him with\r\nthoughts of battle. He was growling in a moody, reflective manner. His\r\neye was full of purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was probably this that caused Spike to look at the householder. Till\r\nthen he had been too busy to gaze elsewhere, but now the bulldog’s eye\r\nhad become so unpleasant that he cast a pathetic glance up at the man by\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“Gee!” he cried, as he did so. “It’s de boss! Say, boss, call off de\r\ndawg. It’s sure goin’ to nip de old head of me.”\r\n\r\nThe other lowered his revolver in surprise.\r\n\r\n“So it’s you, is it, you limb of Satan?” he remarked. “I thought I had\r\nseen that damned red head of yours before. What are you doing in my\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\nSpike uttered a moan of self-pity.\r\n\r\n“Boss,” he cried, “I’ve had a raw deal. Dere’s bin coarse work goin’ on.\r\nListen! It’s dis way. Honest, I didn’t know dis was where you lived. A\r\nfat Swede—Ole Larsen his monaker is—tells me dis house belongs to a\r\nwidder-loidy what lives here all alone, and has all kinds of silver and\r\nall dat, and she’s down Sout’ visiting, so dat de house is empty. Gee,\r\nI’m onto his curves now. I’m wise. Listen, boss. Him and me starts a\r\nscrappin’ last week over somet’in, and I t’inks he’s got it in bad for\r\nme, because I puts it all over him. But t’ree days ago up he comes and\r\nsays, ‘Let’s be fren’s,’ and puts me wise on dis joint. I’ll soak it to\r\ndat Swede! Dis was what he was woikin’ for. He knows you lives here, and\r\nhe t’inks to put me in bad wit youse. It’s a raw deal, boss!”\r\n\r\nThe big man listened to this sad tale of Grecian gifts in silence. Not\r\nso the bulldog, which growled ominously from start to finish. Spike\r\nglanced nervously in its direction.\r\n\r\n“De dawg,” he persisted uneasily. “Won’t you call on de dawg, boss?”\r\n\r\nThe big man stooped and grasped the animal’s collar, jerking him away.\r\n\r\n“The same treatment,” suggested Jimmy, with approval, “would also do a\r\nworld of good to this playful and affectionate animal—unless he is a\r\nvegetarian, in which case don’t bother.”\r\n\r\nThe householder glowered at him.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“My name,” began Jimmy, “is——”\r\n\r\n“Say,” said Spike, “he’s a champion burglar, boss——”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he said.\r\n\r\n“He’s a champion burglar from de odder side. He sure is. From Lunnon.\r\nGee, he’s de guy! Tell him about the bank you opened, and de jools you\r\nswiped from de duchess, and de what-d’ye-call-it blow-pipe.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Jimmy that Spike was showing a certain want of tact. When\r\nyou are discovered by a house-holder—with revolver—in his parlour at\r\nhalf-past three in the morning, it is surely an injudicious move to lay\r\nstress on your proficiency as a burglar. The householder may be supposed\r\nto take it for granted. The side of your character which should be\r\nadvertised in such a crisis is the non-burglarious. Allusion should be\r\nmade to the fact that as a child you attended Sunday-school regularly,\r\nand to what the curate said when you took the Divinity prize. The idea\r\nshould be conveyed to the householder’s mind that, if let off with a\r\ncaution, your innate goodness of heart will lead you to reform and avoid\r\nsuch scenes in future.\r\n\r\nWith some astonishment, therefore, Jimmy found that these revelations,\r\nso far from prejudicing the man with the revolver against him, had\r\napparently told in his favour. The man behind the gun was regarding him\r\nrather with interest than disapproval.\r\n\r\n“So you’re a crook from London, are you?”\r\n\r\nJimmy did not hesitate. If being a crook from London was a passport into\r\ncitizens’ parlours in the small hours, and, more particularly, if it\r\ncarried with it also a safe-conduct out of them, Jimmy was not the man\r\nto refuse the _role_. He bowed.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’ll have to come across now you’re in New York. Understand\r\nthat. And come across good.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, he will,” said Spike, charmed that the tension had been relieved\r\nand matters placed upon a pleasant and business-like footing. “He’ll be\r\ngood. He’s next to de game, sure.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” echoed Jimmy courteously. He did not understand; but things\r\nseemed to be taking a turn for the better, so why disturb the harmony?\r\n\r\n“Dis gent,” said Spike respectfully, “is boss of de cops. A\r\npolice-captain,” he corrected himself.\r\n\r\nA light broke upon Jimmy’s darkness. He wondered he had not understood\r\nbefore. He had not been a newspaper-man in New York for a year without\r\nfinding out something of the inner workings of the police force. He saw\r\nnow why the other’s manner had changed.\r\n\r\n“Pleased to meet you,” he said. “We must have a talk together one of\r\nthese days.”\r\n\r\n“We must,” said the police-captain significantly.\r\n\r\n“Of course, I don’t know your methods on this side, but anything that’s\r\nusual——”\r\n\r\n“I’ll see you at my office. Spike Mullins will show you where it is.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. You must forgive this preliminary informal call. We came in\r\nmore to shelter from the rain than anything.”\r\n\r\n“You did, did you?”\r\n\r\nJimmy felt that it behoved him to stand on his dignity. The situation\r\ndemanded it.\r\n\r\n“Why,” he said, with some hauteur, “in the ordinary course of business I\r\nshould hardly waste time over a small crib like——”\r\n\r\n“It’s banks for his,” murmured Spike rapturously. “He eats dem alive.\r\nAnd jools from duchesses.”\r\n\r\n“I admit a partiality for jewels and duchesses,” said Jimmy. “And now,\r\nas it’s a little late, perhaps we had better—— Ready, Spike? Good night,\r\nthen. Pleased to have met you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll see you at my office.”\r\n\r\n“I may possibly look in. I shall be doing very little work in New York,\r\nI fancy. I am here merely on a vacation.”\r\n\r\n“If you do any work at all,” said the policeman coldly, “you’ll look in\r\nat my office, or you’ll wish you had when it’s too late.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course. I shouldn’t dream of omitting any formality that\r\nmay be usual. But I don’t fancy I shall break my vacation. By the way,\r\none little thing. Have you any objection to my carving a ‘J’ on your\r\nfront door?”\r\n\r\nThe policeman stared.\r\n\r\n“On the inside. It won’t show. It’s just a whim of mine. If you have no\r\nobjection.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want any of your——” began the policeman.\r\n\r\n“You misunderstand me. It’s only that it means paying for a dinner. I\r\nwouldn’t for the world——”\r\n\r\nThe policeman pointed to the window.\r\n\r\n“Out you get,” he said abruptly. “I’ve had enough of you. And don’t you\r\nforget to come to my office.”\r\n\r\nSpike, still deeply mistrustful of the bulldog Rastus, jumped at the\r\ninvitation. He was through the window and out of sight in the friendly\r\ndarkness almost before the policeman had finished speaking. Jimmy\r\nremained.\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted——” he had begun, when he stopped. In the doorway\r\nwas standing a girl—a girl whom he recognized. Her startled look told\r\nhim that she too had recognized him.\r\n\r\nNow for the first time since he had set out from his flat that night in\r\nSpike’s company Jimmy was conscious of a sense of the unreality of\r\nthings. It was all so exactly as it would have happened in a dream. He\r\nhad gone to sleep thinking of this girl, and here she was. But a glance\r\nat McEachern brought him back to earth. There was nothing of the\r\ndream-world about the police-captain.\r\n\r\nThe policeman, whose back was towards the door, had not observed the\r\naddition to the company. Molly had turned the handle quietly and her\r\nslippered feet made no sound. It was the amazed expression on Jimmy’s\r\nface that caused him to look towards the door.\r\n\r\n“Molly!”\r\n\r\nShe smiled, though her face was still white. Jimmy’s evening clothes had\r\nreassured her. She did not understand how he came to be there, but\r\nevidently there was nothing wrong. She had interrupted a conversation,\r\nnot a conflict.\r\n\r\n“I heard the noise and you going downstairs, and I sent the dogs down to\r\nhelp you, father,” she said. “And then, after a little while, I came\r\ndown to see if you were all right.”\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern was perplexed. Molly’s arrival had put him in an awkward\r\nposition. To denounce him as a cracksman was impossible. Jimmy knew too\r\nmuch about him. The only real fear of the policeman’s life was that some\r\nword of his moneymaking methods might come to his daughter’s ears.\r\n\r\nQuite a brilliant idea came to him.\r\n\r\n“A man broke in, my dear,” he said. “This gentleman was passing and saw\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Distinctly,” said Jimmy. “An ugly-looking customer!”\r\n\r\n“But he slipped out of the window and got away,” concluded the\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\n“He was very quick,” said Jimmy. “I think he may have been a\r\nprofessional acrobat.”\r\n\r\n“He didn’t hurt you, father?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I frightened him,” said Jimmy airily.\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern scowled furtively at him.\r\n\r\n“We mustn’t detain you, Mr.——”\r\n\r\n“Pitt,” said Jimmy. “My name is Pitt.” He turned to Molly. “I hope you\r\nenjoyed the voyage.”\r\n\r\nThe policeman started.\r\n\r\n“You know my daughter?”\r\n\r\n“By sight only, I’m afraid. We were fellow-passengers on the\r\n_Mauretania_. Unfortunately I was in the second cabin. I used to see\r\nyour daughter walking the deck sometimes.”\r\n\r\nMolly smiled.\r\n\r\n“I remember seeing you—sometimes.”\r\n\r\nMcEachern burst out:\r\n\r\n“Then you——”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked at Molly. Molly was bending over Rastus, tickling\r\nhim under the ear.\r\n\r\n“Let me show you the way out, Mr. Pitt,” said the policeman shortly. His\r\nmanner was abrupt, but when one is speaking to a man whom one would\r\ndearly love to throw out of the window abruptness is almost unavoidable.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I should be going,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Good night, Mr. Pitt,” said Molly.\r\n\r\n“I hope we shall meet again,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“This way, Mr. Pitt,” growled McEachern, holding the door.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t trouble,” said Jimmy. He went to the window, and, flinging\r\nhis leg over the sill, dropped noiselessly to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe turned and put his head in at the window again.\r\n\r\n“I did that rather well,” he said pleasantly. “I think I must take up\r\nthis sort of thing as a profession. Good night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 8 ★\r\n                              _At Dreever_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days before the Welshman began to expend his surplus energy in\r\nplaying Rugby football he was accustomed, whenever the monotony of his\r\neveryday life began to oppress him, to collect a few friends and make\r\nraids across the border into England, to the huge discomfort of the\r\ndwellers on the other side. It was to cope with this habit that Dreever\r\nCastle, in Shropshire, came into existence. It met a long-felt want. In\r\ntime of trouble it became a haven of refuge. From all sides people\r\npoured into it, emerging cautiously when the marauders had disappeared.\r\nIn the whole history of the castle there is but one instance recorded of\r\na bandit attempting to take the place by storm, and the attack was an\r\nemphatic failure. On receipt of a ladleful of molten lead, aimed to a\r\nnicety by one John, the Chaplain—evidently one of those sporting\r\nparsons—this warrior retired, done to a turn, to his mountain\r\nfastnesses, and is never heard of again. He would seem, however, to have\r\npassed the word round among his friends, for subsequent raiding parties\r\nstudiously avoided the castle, and a peasant who had succeeded in\r\ncrossing its threshold was for the future considered to be “home” and\r\nout of the game.\r\n\r\nSuch was Dreever in the olden times. To-day the Welshman having calmed\r\ndown considerably, it had lost its militant character. The old walls\r\nstill stood, grey, menacing, and unchanged, but they were the only link\r\nwith the past. The castle was now a very comfortable country-house,\r\nnominally ruled over by Hildebrand Spencer Poyns de Burgh John Hannasyde\r\nCoombe-Crombie, twelfth Earl of Dreever (“Spennie” to his relatives and\r\nintimates), but in reality the possession of his uncle and aunt, Sir\r\nThomas and Lady Julia Blunt.\r\n\r\nSpennie’s position was one of some embarrassment. At no point in their\r\nhistory had the Dreevers been what one might call a parsimonious family.\r\nIf a chance presented itself of losing money in a particularly wild and\r\nfutile manner, the Dreever of the period had invariably sprung at it\r\nwith the vim of an energetic bloodhound. The South Sea Bubble absorbed\r\n£200,000 of good Dreever money, and the remainder of the family fortune\r\nwas squandered to the ultimate farthing by the sportive gentleman who\r\nhad held the title in the days of the Regency, when Watier’s and the\r\nCocoa Tree were in their prime, and fortunes had a habit of disappearing\r\nin a single evening. When Spennie became Earl of Dreever there was about\r\neighteenpence in the old oak chest.\r\n\r\nThis is the point at which Sir Thomas Blunt breaks into Dreever history.\r\nSir Thomas was a small, pink, fussy, obstinate man, with a genius for\r\ntrade and the ambition of a Napoleon, probably one of the finest and\r\nmost complete specimens of the\r\ncame-over-Waterloo-Bridge-with-half-a-crown-in-my-pocket-and-now-look-at-me\r\nclass of millionaire in existence. He had started almost literally with\r\nnothing. By carefully excluding from his mind every thought except that\r\nof making money, he had risen in the world with a gruesome persistence\r\nwhich nothing could check. At the age of fifty-one he was chairman of\r\nBlunt’s Stores, Ltd., a member of Parliament, silent as a wax figure,\r\nbut a great comfort to the party by virtue of liberal contributions to\r\nits funds, and a knight. This was good, but he aimed still higher; and,\r\nmeeting Spennie’s aunt, Lady Julia Coombe-Crombie, just at the moment\r\nwhen, financially, the Dreevers were at their lowest ebb, he had\r\neffected a very satisfactory deal by marrying her, thereby becoming as\r\none might say, the chairman of Dreever, Ltd. Until Spennie should marry\r\nmoney, an act on which his chairman vehemently insisted, Sir Thomas held\r\nthe purse, and, except in minor matters ordered by his wife, of whom he\r\nstood in uneasy awe, had things entirely his own way.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, a year after the events recorded in the preceding\r\nchapter, he was in his private room, looking out of the window. The view\r\nfrom that window was very beautiful. The castle stood on a hill, the\r\nlower portion of which, between the house and the lake, had been cut\r\ninto broad terraces. The lake itself, with its island with the little\r\nboathouse in the centre, was a glimpse of Fairyland.\r\n\r\nBut it was not altogether the beauty of the view that had drawn Sir\r\nThomas to the window. He was looking at it more because the position\r\nenabled him to avoid his wife’s eye; and, just at the moment, he was\r\nrather anxious to avoid his wife’s eye. A somewhat stormy board meeting\r\nwas in progress, and Lady Julia, who constituted the board of directors,\r\nhad been heckling the chairman. The point under discussion was one of\r\netiquette, and in matters of etiquette Sir Thomas felt himself at a\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, my dear,” he said to the window, “I am not easy in my\r\nmind.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” snapped Lady Julia. “Absurd! Ridiculous!”\r\n\r\nLady Julia Blunt, when conversing, resembled a Maxim gun more than\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n“But your diamonds, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“I can take care of them.”\r\n\r\n“But why should you have the trouble? Now, if we——”\r\n\r\n“It’s no trouble.”\r\n\r\n“When we were married there was a detective——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be childish, Thomas. Detectives at weddings are quite customary.”\r\n\r\n“But——”\r\n\r\n“Bah——”\r\n\r\n“I paid twenty thousand pounds for that rope of pearls,” said Sir Thomas\r\nobstinately. Switch things on to a cash basis and he was more himself.\r\n\r\n“May I ask if you suspect any of our guests of being criminals?”\r\ninquired Lady Julia, frostily.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas looked out of the window. At the moment the sternest censor\r\ncould have found nothing to cavil at in the movements of such of the\r\nhouse-party as were in sight. Some were playing tennis, some clock golf,\r\nand others were smoking.\r\n\r\n“Why not,” he began.\r\n\r\n“Of course. Absurd! Quite absurd!”\r\n\r\n“But the servants. We have engaged a number of new servants lately.”\r\n\r\n“With excellent recommendations.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was on the point of suggesting that the recommendations might\r\nbe forged, but his courage failed him. Julia was sometimes so abrupt in\r\nthese little discussions. She did not enter into his point of view. He\r\nwas always a trifle inclined to treat the castle as a branch of Blunt’s\r\nStores. As proprietor of the stores he had made a point of suspecting\r\neverybody, and the results had been excellent. In Blunt’s Stores you\r\ncould hardly move in any direction without bumping into a gentlemanly\r\ndetective efficiently disguised. For the life of him Sir Thomas could\r\nnot see why the same principle should not obtain at Dreever. Guests at a\r\ncountry house do not as a rule steal their host’s possessions, but then\r\nit is only an occasional customer at a store who goes in for shop\r\nlifting. It was the principle of the thing, he thought. Be prepared\r\nagainst every emergency. With Sir Thomas Blunt suspiciousness was almost\r\na mania. He was forced to admit that the chances were against any of his\r\nguests exhibiting larcenous tendencies, but, as for the servants, he\r\nthoroughly mistrusted them all except Saunders, the butler. It had\r\nseemed to him the merest prudence that a detective from a private\r\ninquiry agency should be installed at the castle while the house was\r\nfull. Somewhat rashly he had mentioned this to his wife, and Lady\r\nJulia’s critique of the scheme had been terse and unflattering.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Lady Julia sarcastically, “you will jump to the\r\nconclusion that this man whom Spennie is bringing down with him to-day\r\nis a criminal of some sort?”\r\n\r\n“Eh? Is Spennie bringing a friend?”\r\n\r\nThere was not a great deal of enthusiasm in Sir Thomas’s voice. His\r\nnephew was not a young man whom he respected very highly. Spennie\r\nregarded his uncle with nervous apprehension, as one who would deal with\r\nhis shortcomings with vigour and severity. Sir Thomas, for his part,\r\nlooked on Spennie as a youth who would get into mischief unless he had\r\nan eye fixed on him. So he proceeded to fix that eye.\r\n\r\n“I had a wire from him just now.”\r\n\r\n“Who is his friend?”\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t say. He just says he’s a man he met in London.”\r\n\r\n“H’m!”\r\n\r\n“And what does ‘H’m!’ mean?” demanded Lady Julia.\r\n\r\n“A man can pick up strange people in London,” said Sir Thomas\r\njudicially.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“Just as you say, my dear.”\r\n\r\nLady Julia rose.\r\n\r\n“As for what you suggest about the detective, it is, of course,\r\nabsolutely absurd.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t think of it.”\r\n\r\n“Just as you say, my dear.”\r\n\r\nLady Julia left the room.\r\n\r\nWhat followed may afford some slight clue to the secret of Sir Thomas\r\nBlunt’s rise in the world. It certainly suggests singleness of purpose,\r\nwhich is one of the essentials of success.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the door closed behind Lady Julia than he went to his\r\nwriting-table, took pen and paper, and wrote the following letter:\r\n\r\n“To the Manager, Wragge’s Detective Agency, Holborn Bars, London, E.C.\r\n\r\n“Sir,—With reference to my last of the 28th ult., I should be glad if\r\nyou would send down immediately one of your best men. Am making\r\narrangements to receive him. Kindly instruct him to present himself at\r\nDreever Castle as applicant for position of valet to myself. I will see\r\nand engage him on his arrival, and further instruct him in his\r\nduties.—Yours faithfully, Thos. Blunt.\r\n\r\n“P.S.—I shall expect him to-morrow evening. There is a good train\r\nleaving Paddington at 2.15.”\r\n\r\nHe read it over and put in a couple of commas, then placed it in an\r\nenvelope, and lit a cigar with the air of one who can be checked—yes,\r\nbut vanquished, never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 9 ★\r\n                     _A New Friend and an Old One_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of the day on which Sir Thomas Blunt wrote his letter to\r\nWragge’s, Jimmy Pitt was supping at the Savoy.\r\n\r\nIf you have the money and the clothes, and do not object to being turned\r\nout into the night just as you are beginning to enjoy yourself, there\r\nare few things pleasanter than supper at the Savoy Hotel, London. But as\r\nJimmy sat there, eyeing the multitude through the smoke of his\r\ncigarette, he felt, despite all the brightness and glitter, that this\r\nwas a flat world and that he was very much alone in it.\r\n\r\nA little over a year had passed since the merry evening at\r\nPolice-Captain McEachern’s. During that time he had covered a good deal\r\nof new ground. His restlessness had reasserted itself. Somebody had\r\nmentioned Morocco in his hearing, and a fortnight later he was in Fez.\r\n\r\nOf the principals in that night’s drama he had seen nothing more. It was\r\nonly when walking home on air, rejoicing over the strange chance which\r\nhad led to his finding and having speech with the lady of the\r\n_Mauretania_—he had reached Fifty-Ninth Street—that he realised that he\r\nhad also lost her. It suddenly came home to him that not only did he not\r\nknow her address, but was also ignorant of her name. Spike had called\r\nthe man with the revolver “boss” throughout—only that and nothing more.\r\nExcept that he was a police captain, Jimmy knew as little about him as\r\nhe had done before their meeting. And Spike, who held the key to the\r\nmystery, had vanished. His acquaintances of that night had passed out of\r\nhis life like figures in a waking dream. As far as the big man with the\r\npistol was concerned, this did not distress him. He had only known that\r\nmassive person for about a quarter of an hour, but to his thinking that\r\nwas ample. Spike he would have liked to have met again, but he bore the\r\nseparation with fortitude. There remained the girl of the ship, and she\r\nhad haunted him with unfailing persistence during every one of the three\r\nhundred and eighty-four days which had passed since their meeting.\r\n\r\nIt was the thought of her that had made New York seem cramped. For weeks\r\nhe had patrolled the more likely streets, the Park, and Riverside Drive\r\nin the hope of meeting her. He had gone to the theatres and restaurants,\r\nbut with no success. Sometimes he had wandered through the Bowery on the\r\nchance of meeting Spike. He had seen red heads in profusion, but none\r\nthat belonged to his young disciple in the art of burglary. In the end\r\nhe had wearied of the search, and, to the disgust of Arthur Mifflin and\r\nhis other friends of the Strollers’, had gone out again on his\r\nwanderings. He was greatly missed, especially by that large section of\r\nhis circle which was in a perpetual state of wanting a little to see it\r\nthrough till Saturday. For years Jimmy had been to these unfortunates a\r\nhuman bank on which they could draw at will. It offended them that one\r\nof those rare natures which are always good for two dollars at any hour\r\nof the day should be allowed to waste itself on places like Morocco and\r\nSpain—especially Morocco, where, by all accounts, there were brigands\r\nwith almost a New York sense of touch.\r\n\r\nThey argued earnestly with Jimmy. They spoke of Raisuli and Kaid\r\nMaclean. But Jimmy was not to be stopped. The gadfly was vexing him, and\r\nhe had to move.\r\n\r\nFor a year he had wandered, realising every day the truth of Horace’s\r\nphilosophy for those who travel—that a man cannot change his feelings\r\nwith his climate, until finally he had found himself, as every wanderer\r\ndoes, at Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nAt this point he had tried to rally. This running away, he told himself,\r\nwas futile. He would stand still and fight the fever in him.\r\n\r\nHe had been fighting it now for a matter of two weeks, and already he\r\nwas contemplating retreat. A man at lunch had been talking about Japan——\r\n\r\nWatching the crowd, Jimmy had found his attention attracted chiefly by a\r\nparty of three a few tables away. The party consisted of a girl, rather\r\npretty; a lady of middle-age and stately demeanour, plainly her mother;\r\nand a light-haired, weedy young man in the twenties. It had been the\r\nalmost incessant prattle of this youth and the peculiarly high-pitched,\r\ngurgling laugh which shot from him at short intervals which had drawn\r\nJimmy’s notice upon them. And it was the curious cessation of both\r\nprattle and laugh which now made him look again in their direction.\r\n\r\nThe young man faced Jimmy; and Jimmy, looking at him, could see that all\r\nwas not well. He was pale. He talked at random.\r\n\r\nJimmy caught his eye. There was a hunted look in it.\r\n\r\nGiven the time and the place, there were only two things which could\r\nhave caused that look. Either the light-haired young man had seen a\r\nghost, or he had suddenly realised that he had not enough money to pay\r\nthe bill.\r\n\r\nJimmy’s heart went out to the sufferer. He took a card from his case,\r\nscribbled the words, “Can I help?” on it, and gave it to a waiter to\r\ntake to the young man, who was now in a state bordering on collapse.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the light-haired one was at his table, talking in a\r\nfeverish whisper.\r\n\r\n“I say,” he said, “it’s frightfully good of you, old chap; it’s\r\nfrightfully awkward. I’ve come out with too little money. I hardly like\r\nto——. You’ve never seen me before——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t rub in my misfortunes,” pleaded Jimmy. “It wasn’t my fault.”\r\n\r\nHe placed a £5 note on the table.\r\n\r\n“Say when,” he said, producing another.\r\n\r\n“I say, thanks fearfully,” the young man said. “I don’t know what I’d\r\nhave done.” He grabbed at the note. “I’ll let you have it back\r\nto-morrow. Here’s my card. Is your address on your card? I can’t\r\nremember. Oh, by Jove, I’ve got it in my hand all the time.” The\r\ngurgling laugh came into action again, freshened and strengthened by its\r\nrest. “Savoy Mansions, eh? I’ll come round to-morrow. Thanks frightfully\r\nagain, old chap. I don’t know what I should have done.”\r\n\r\n“It’s been a treat,” said Jimmy deprecatingly.\r\n\r\nThe young man flitted back to his table, bearing the spoil. Jimmy looked\r\nat the card he had left. “Lord Dreever,” it read, and in the corner the\r\nname of a well-known club. The name Dreever was familiar to Jimmy. Every\r\none knew of Dreever Castle, partly because it was one of the oldest\r\nhouses in England, but principally because for centuries it had been\r\nadvertised by a particularly gruesome ghost-story. Every one had heard\r\nof the secret of Dreever, which was known only to the Earl and the\r\nfamily lawyer, and confided to the heir at midnight on his twenty-first\r\nbirthday. Jimmy had come across the story in corners of the papers all\r\nover the States, from New York to Onehorseville, Iowa. He looked with\r\ninterest at the light-haired young man—the latest depository of the\r\nawful secret. It was popularly supposed that the heir, after hearing it,\r\nnever smiled again: but it did not seem to have affected the present\r\nLord Dreever to any great extent. His gurgling laugh was drowning the\r\norchestra. Probably, Jimmy thought, when the family lawyer had told the\r\nlight-haired young man the secret, the latter’s comment had been, “No,\r\nreally? By Jove, I say, you know!”\r\n\r\nJimmy paid his bill and got up to go.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect summer night—too perfect for bed. Jimmy strolled on to\r\nthe Embankment, and stood leaning over the balustrade, looking across\r\nthe river at the vague, mysterious mass of buildings on the Surrey side.\r\n\r\nHe must have been standing there for some time, his thoughts far away,\r\nwhen a voice spoke at his elbow.\r\n\r\n“I say. Excuse me, have you—Halloa!”\r\n\r\nIt was his light-haired lordship of Dreever.\r\n\r\n“I say, by Jove! Why, we’re always meeting!”\r\n\r\nA tramp on the bench close by stirred uneasily in his sleep as the\r\ngurgling laughter ripped the air.\r\n\r\n“Been looking at the water?” inquired Lord Dreever. “I have. I often do.\r\nDon’t you think it sort of makes a chap feel—oh, you know. Sort of—I\r\ndon’t know how to put it.”\r\n\r\n“Mushy?” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“I was going to say poetical. Suppose there’s a girl——”\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked down at the water. Jimmy was with him there. There\r\nwas a girl.\r\n\r\n“I saw my party off in a taxi,” continued Lord Dreever, “and came down\r\nhere for a smoke. Only I hadn’t a match. Have you?”\r\n\r\nJimmy handed over his match-box. Lord Dreever lit a cigar, and fixed his\r\ngaze once more on the river.\r\n\r\n“Ripping it looks,” he said.\r\n\r\nJimmy nodded.\r\n\r\n“Funny thing,” said Lord Dreever. “In the daytime the water here looks\r\nall muddy and beastly. Damn depressing, I call it. But at night——” He\r\npaused. “I say,” he went on, after a moment, “did you see the girl I was\r\nwith at the Savoy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“She’s a ripper,” said Lord Dreever devoutly.\r\n\r\nOn the Thames Embankment, in the small hours of a summer morning, there\r\nis no such thing as a stranger. The man you talk with is a friend, and\r\nif he will listen—as, by the etiquette of the place, he must—you may\r\npour out your heart to him without restraint. It is expected of you.\r\n\r\n“I’m fearfully in love with her,” said his lordship.\r\n\r\n“She looked a charming girl,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThey examined the water in silence. From somewhere out in the night came\r\nthe sound of oars, where the police-boat moved on its patrol.\r\n\r\n“Does she make you want to go to Japan?” asked Jimmy suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said Lord Dreever, startled. “Japan?”\r\n\r\nJimmy adroitly abandoned the position of confidant and seized that of\r\nconfider.\r\n\r\n“I met a girl a year ago. Only really met her once, and even then—oh,\r\nwell. Anyway, it’s made me so restless that I haven’t been able to stay\r\nin one place for more than a month on end. I tried Morocco, and had to\r\nquit. I tried Spain, and that wasn’t any good either. The other day I\r\nheard a fellow say that Japan was a pretty interesting sort of country.\r\nI was wondering whether I wouldn’t give it a trial.”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever regarded this travelled man with interest.\r\n\r\n“It beats me,” he said wonderingly. “What do you want to leg it about\r\nthe world like that for? What’s the trouble? Why don’t you stay where\r\nthe girl is?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know where she is.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t know?”\r\n\r\n“She disappeared.”\r\n\r\n“Where did you see her last?” asked his lordship, as if Molly were a\r\nmislaid penknife.\r\n\r\n“New York.”\r\n\r\n“But how do you mean, disappeared? Don’t you know her address?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t even know her name.”\r\n\r\n“But dash it all, I say, I mean! Have you ever spoken to her?”\r\n\r\n“Only once. It’s rather a complicated story. At any rate, she’s gone.”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever said that it was a rum business. Jimmy conceded the point.\r\n\r\n“Seems to me,” said his lordship, “we’re both in the cart.”\r\n\r\n“What’s your trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, it’s only that I want to marry one girl, and my uncle’s dead\r\nset on my marrying another.”\r\n\r\n“Are you afraid of hurting your uncle’s feelings?”\r\n\r\n“It’s not so much hurting his feelings. It’s—oh, well, it’s too long to\r\ntell now. I think I’ll be getting home. I’m staying at our place in\r\nEaton Square.”\r\n\r\n“How are you going? If you’ll walk I’ll come some of the way with you.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are. Let’s be pushing along, shall we?”\r\n\r\nThey turned up into the Strand, and through Trafalgar Square into\r\nPiccadilly. Piccadilly has a restful aspect in the small hours. Some men\r\nwere cleaning the road with water from a long hose. The swishing of the\r\ntorrent on the parched wood was musical.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the gate of Hyde Park, to the right of the road, stands a\r\ncabman’s shelter. Conversation and emotion had made Lord Dreever\r\nthirsty. He suggested coffee as a suitable conclusion to the night’s\r\nrevels.\r\n\r\n“I often go in here when I’m up in town,” he said. “The cabbies don’t\r\nmind. They’re sportsmen.”\r\n\r\nThe shelter was nearly full when they opened the door. It was very warm\r\ninside. A cabman gets so much fresh air in the exercise of his\r\nprofessional duties that he is apt to avoid it in private life. The air\r\nwas heavy with conflicting scents. Fried onions seemed to be having the\r\nbest of the struggle for the moment, though plug tobacco competed\r\ngallantly. A keenly analytical nose might also have detected the\r\npresence of steak and coffee.\r\n\r\nA dispute seemed to be in progress as they entered.\r\n\r\n“You don’t wish you was in Russher,” said a voice.\r\n\r\n“Yus, I do wish I was in Russher,” retorted a shrivelled mummy of a\r\ncabman who was blowing patiently at a saucerful of coffee.\r\n\r\n“Why do you wish you was in Russher?” asked the interlocutor,\r\nintroducing a Massa Bones and Massa Johnsing touch into the dialogue.\r\n\r\n“Because you can wade over yer knees in bla-a-ad there,” said the mummy.\r\n\r\n“In wot?”\r\n\r\n“In bla-a-ad—ruddy bla-a-ad. That’s why I wish I wos in Russher.”\r\n\r\n“Cheery cove that,” said Lord Dreever. “I say, can you give us some\r\ncoffee?”\r\n\r\n“I might try Russia after Japan,” said Jimmy meditatively.\r\n\r\nThe lethal liquid was brought. Conversation began again. Other experts\r\ngave their views on the internal affairs of Russia. Jimmy would have\r\nenjoyed it more if he had been less sleepy. His back was wedged\r\ncomfortably against the wall of the shelter, and the heat of the room\r\nstole into his brain. The voices of the disputants grew fainter and\r\nfainter.\r\n\r\nHe had almost dozed off when a new voice cut through the murmur and woke\r\nhim. It was a voice he knew, and the accent was a familiar accent.\r\n\r\n“Gents, excuse me.”\r\n\r\nHe looked up. The mists of sleep shredded away. A ragged youth with a\r\ncrop of fiery red hair was standing in the doorway, regarding the\r\noccupants of the shelter with a grin, half whimsical, half defiant.\r\n\r\nJimmy recognized him. It was Spike Mullins.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” said Spike Mullins, “is dere any gent in dis bunch of\r\nprofessional beauts wants to give a poor orphan dat suffers from a\r\npainful toist something to drink? Gents is courteously requested not to\r\nspeak all in a crowd.”\r\n\r\n“Shet that blanky door,” said the mummy cabman sourly.\r\n\r\n“And ’op it,” added his late opponent. “We don’t want none of your sort\r\n’ere.”\r\n\r\n“Den you ain’t my long-lost brudders, after all,” said the newcomer\r\nregretfully. “I t’ought youse didn’t look handsome enough for dat. Good\r\nnight to youse, gents.”\r\n\r\n“Shet that door, can’t yer, when I’m tellin’ yer!” said the mummy, with\r\nincreased asperity.\r\n\r\nSpike was reluctantly withdrawing when Jimmy rose.\r\n\r\n“One moment,” he said.\r\n\r\nNever in his life had Jimmy failed to stand by a friend in need. Spike\r\nwas not, perhaps, exactly a friend, but even an acquaintance could rely\r\non Jimmy when down in the world. And Spike was manifestly in that\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nA look of surprise came into the Bowery boy’s face, followed by one of\r\nstolid woodenness. He took the sovereign which Jimmy held out to him\r\nwith a muttered word of thanks, and shuffled out of the room.\r\n\r\n“Can’t see what you wanted to give him anything for,” said Lord Dreever.\r\n“Chap’ll only spend it getting tight.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he reminded me of a man I used to know.”\r\n\r\n“Did he? Barnum’s what-is-it, I should think,” said his lordship. “Shall\r\nwe be moving?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 10 ★\r\n                       _Jimmy Adopts a Lame Dog_\r\n\r\n\r\nA black figure detached itself from the blacker shadows and shuffled\r\nstealthily to where Jimmy stood on the doorstep.\r\n\r\n“That you, Spike?” asked Jimmy, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Dat’s right, boss.”\r\n\r\n“Come on in.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way up to his rooms, switched on the electric light, and shut\r\nthe door. Spike stood blinking at the sudden glare. He twirled his\r\nbattered hat in his hands. His red hair shone fiercely.\r\n\r\nJimmy inspected him out of the corner of his eye, and came to the\r\nconclusion that the Mullins finances must be at a low ebb. Spike’s\r\ncostume differed in several important details from that of the ordinary\r\nwell-groomed man about town. There was nothing of the _flâneur_ about\r\nthe Bowery boy. His hat was of the soft black felt fashionable on the\r\nEast Side of New York. It was in poor condition, and looked as if it had\r\nbeen up too late the night before. A black tail-coat, burst at the\r\nelbows and stained with mud, was tightly buttoned across his chest, this\r\nevidently with the idea of concealing the fact that he wore no shirt—an\r\nattempt which was not wholly successful. A pair of grey flannel trousers\r\nand boots, out of which two toes peeped coyly, completed the picture.\r\n\r\nEven Spike himself seemed to be aware that there were points in his\r\nappearance which would have distressed the editor of the _Tailor and\r\nCutter_.\r\n\r\n“’Scuse these duds,” he said. “Me man’s bin an’ mislaid de trunk wit me\r\nbest suit in. Dis is me number two.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it, Spike,” said Jimmy. “You look a perfect _matinee_\r\nidol. Have a drink?”\r\n\r\nSpike’s eyes gleamed as he reached for the decanter. He took a seat.\r\n\r\n“Cigar, Spike?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. T’anks, boss.”\r\n\r\nJimmy lit his pipe. Spike, after a few genteel sips, threw off his\r\nrestraint and finished the rest of his glass at a gulp.\r\n\r\n“Try another?” suggested Jimmy.\r\n\r\nSpike’s grin showed that the idea had been well received.\r\n\r\nJimmy sat and smoked in silence for a while. He was thinking the thing\r\nover. He felt like a detective who has found a clue. At last he would be\r\nable to discover the name of the _Mauretania_ girl. The discovery would\r\nnot take him very far, certainly, but it would be something. Possibly\r\nSpike might even be able to fix the position of the house they had\r\nbroken into that night.\r\n\r\nSpike was looking at him over his glass with silent admiration. This\r\nflat, which Jimmy had rented for a year, in the hope that the possession\r\nof a fixed abode might help to tie him down to one spot, was handsomely,\r\neven luxuriously, furnished. To Spike every chair and table in the room\r\nhad a romance of its own as having been purchased out of the proceeds of\r\nthat New Asiatic Bank robbery, or from the revenue accruing from the\r\nDuchess of Havent’s jewels. He was dumb with reverence for one who could\r\nmake burglary pay to this extent. In his own case the profession had\r\nrarely provided anything more than bread and butter and an occasional\r\ntrip to Coney Island.\r\n\r\nJimmy caught his eye, and spoke.\r\n\r\n“Well, Spike,” he said. “Curious that we should meet like this?”\r\n\r\n“De limit,” agreed Spike.\r\n\r\n“I can’t imagine you three thousand miles from New York. How do you know\r\nthe cars still run both ways on Broadway?”\r\n\r\nA wistful look came into Spike’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“I t’ought it was time I give old Lunnon a call. T’ings was getting too\r\nfierce in Noo York. De cops was layin’ for me. Dey didn’t seem like as\r\nif they had any use for me. So I beat it.”\r\n\r\n“Bad luck,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Fierce,” agreed Spike.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Spike,” said Jimmy, “I spent a great deal of time before I\r\nleft New York looking for you.”\r\n\r\n“Gee, I wish you’d found me. And did youse want me to help on some lay,\r\nboss?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no, not that. Do you remember that night we broke into that house\r\nup-town—the police-captain’s house?”\r\n\r\n“Sure.”\r\n\r\n“What was his name?”\r\n\r\n“What, de cop’s? Why, McEachern, boss.”\r\n\r\n“Mac what? How do you spell it?”\r\n\r\n“Search me,” said Spike, simply.\r\n\r\n“Say it again. Fill your lungs and enunciate slowly and clearly. Be\r\nbell-like. Now.”\r\n\r\n“McEachern.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! And where was the house? Can you remember that?”\r\n\r\nSpike’s forehead wrinkled.\r\n\r\n“It’s gone,” he said at last. “It was somewheres up some street up de\r\ntown.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a lot of help,” said Jimmy. “Try again.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll come back some time, boss, sure.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’m going to keep an eye on you till it does. Just for the moment\r\nyou’re the most important man in the world to me. Where are you living?”\r\n\r\n“Me? Why, in de Park. Dat’s right. One of dem swell detached benches wit\r\na southern exposure.”\r\n\r\n“Well, unless you prefer it, you needn’t sleep in the Park any more. You\r\ncan pitch your moving tent with me.”\r\n\r\n“What, here, boss?”\r\n\r\n“Unless we move.”\r\n\r\n“Me fer dis,” said Spike, rolling luxuriously in his chair.\r\n\r\n“You’ll want some clothes,” said Jimmy. “We’ll get those to-morrow.\r\nYou’re the sort of figure they can fit off the peg. You’re not too tall,\r\nwhich is a good thing.”\r\n\r\n“Bad t’ing for me, boss. If I’d bin taller I’d have stood for being a\r\ncop, and bin buying a brown-stone house on Fifth Avenue by this. It’s de\r\ncops makes de big money in little old Manhattan, dat’s who it is.”\r\n\r\n“The man who knows!” said Jimmy. “Tell me more, Spike. I suppose a good\r\nmany of the New York force do get rich by graft?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Look at old man McEachern.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could. Tell me about him, Spike. You seemed to know him pretty\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\n“Me? Sure. Dere wasn’t a worse grafter dan him in de bunch. He was out\r\nfor the dough all the time. But, say, did youse ever see his girl?”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” said Jimmy sharply.\r\n\r\n“I seen her once.” Spike became almost lyrical in his enthusiasm. “Gee,\r\nshe was a bird. A peach for fair. I’d have left me happy home for her.\r\nMolly was her monaker. She——”\r\n\r\nJimmy was glaring at him.\r\n\r\n“Drop it!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“What’s dat, boss?” said Spike.\r\n\r\n“Cut it out!” said Jimmy savagely.\r\n\r\nSpike looked at him amazed.\r\n\r\n“Sure,” he said, puzzled, but realising that his words had not pleased\r\nthe great man.\r\n\r\nJimmy chewed the stem of his pipe irritably, while Spike, full of\r\nexcellent intentions, sat on the edge of his chair drawing sorrowfully\r\nat his cigar and wondering what he had done to give offence.\r\n\r\n“Boss?” said Spike.\r\n\r\n“Halloa!”\r\n\r\n“Boss, what’s doin’ here? Put me next to de game. Is it de old lay?\r\nBanks and jools from duchesses! You’ll be able to let me sit in on de\r\ngame, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I’d quite forgotten I hadn’t told you about myself, Spike. I’ve\r\nretired.”\r\n\r\nThe horrid truth sank slowly into the other’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Say! What’s dat, boss? You’re cuttin’ it out?”\r\n\r\n“That’s it. Absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t youse swiping no more jools?”\r\n\r\n“Not me.”\r\n\r\n“Nor usin’ de what’s-its-name blow-pipe?”\r\n\r\n“I have sold my oxyacetylene blow-pipe, given away my anaesthetics, and\r\nam going to turn over a new leaf and settle down as a respectable\r\ncitizen.”\r\n\r\nSpike gasped. His world had fallen about his ears. His excursion with\r\nJimmy, the master cracksman, in New York had been the highest and\r\nproudest memory of his life, and now that he had met him again in\r\nLondon, he had looked forward to a long and prosperous partnership in\r\ncrime. He was content that his own share in the partnership should be\r\nhumble. It was enough for him to be connected, however humbly, with such\r\na master. He had looked upon the richness of London, and he had said\r\nwith Blucher, “What a city to loot!”\r\n\r\nAnd here was his idol shattering his visions with a word.\r\n\r\n“Have another drink, Spike,” said the Lost Leader sympathetically. “It’s\r\na shock to you, I expect.”\r\n\r\n“I t’ought, boss——”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know. These are life’s tragedies. I’m very sorry for you; but\r\nit can’t be helped.”\r\n\r\nSpike sat silent, with a long face. Jimmy slapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Cheer up,” he said. “How do you know that living honestly may not be\r\nsplendid fun? Numbers of people do it, you know, and enjoy themselves\r\ntremendously. You must give it a trial, Spike.”\r\n\r\n“Me, boss? What, me too?”\r\n\r\n“Rather. You’re my link with——I don’t want to have you remembering that\r\naddress in the second month of a ten-year spell at Dartmoor. I’m going\r\nto look after you, Spike, my son, like a lynx. We’ll go out together and\r\nsee life. Buck up, Spike! Be cheerful! Grin!”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s reflection the other grinned, howbeit faintly.\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said Jimmy. “We’ll go into society, Spike, hand in hand.\r\nYou’ll be a terrific success in society. All you have to do is to look\r\ncheerful, brush your hair, and keep your hands off the spoons, for in\r\nthe best circles they invariably count them after the departure of the\r\nlast guest.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said Spike, as one who thoroughly understood this sensible\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Jimmy, “we’ll be turning in. Can you manage sleeping on\r\nthe sofa one night? Some fellows would give their bed up to you.\r\nHowever, I’ll have a bed made up for you to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Me!” said Spike. “Gee! I’ve been sleepin’ in de Park all de last week.\r\nDis is to de good, boss.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 11 ★\r\n                       _At the Turn of the Road_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the meeting at the Savoy when Jimmy, having sent\r\nSpike off to the tailor’s, was dealing with a combination of breakfast\r\nand lunch at his flat, Lord Dreever called.\r\n\r\n“Thought I should find you in,” observed his lordship. “Well, laddie,\r\nhow goes it? Having breakfast? Eggs _and_ bacon! Great Scot, I couldn’t\r\ntouch a thing!”\r\n\r\nThe statement was borne out by his looks. The son of a hundred earls was\r\npale, and his eyes were markedly fish-like.\r\n\r\n“A fellow I’ve got stopping with me—taking him down to Dreever with me\r\nto-day—man I met at the club—fellow named Hargate. Don’t know if you\r\nknow him? No? Well, he was still up when I got back last night, and we\r\nstayed up playing pills—he’s rotten at pills; something frightful; I\r\ngive him thirty—till five this morning. I feel frightfully cheap.\r\nWouldn’t have got up at all, only I’m due to catch the two-fifteen down\r\nto Dreever. It’s the only good train.”\r\n\r\nHe dropped into a chair.\r\n\r\n“Sorry you don’t feel up to breakfast,” said Jimmy, helping himself to\r\nmarmalade. “I am generally to be found among those lining up when the\r\ngong goes. I’ve breakfasted on a glass of water and a bag of bird-seed\r\nin my time. That sort of thing makes you ready to take whatever you can\r\nget. Seen the papers?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\nJimmy finished his breakfast and lit a pipe. Lord Dreever laid down the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n“I say,” he said, “what I came round about was this. What have you got\r\non just now?”\r\n\r\nJimmy had imagined that his friend had dropped in to return the\r\nfive-pound note he had borrowed, but his lordship maintained a complete\r\nreserve on the subject. Jimmy was to discover later that this weakness\r\nof memory where financial obligations were concerned was a leading trait\r\nin Lord Dreever’s character.\r\n\r\n“To-day, do you mean?” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Well, in the near future. What I mean is, why not put off that Japan\r\ntrip you spoke about and come down to Dreever with me?”\r\n\r\nJimmy reflected. After all, Japan or Dreever, it made very little\r\ndifference. And it would be interesting seeing a place about which he\r\nhad read so much.\r\n\r\n“That’s very good of you,” he said. “You’re sure it will be all right?\r\nIt won’t be upsetting your arrangements?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit. The more the merrier. Can’t you catch the two-fifteen? It’s\r\nfearfully short notice.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens, yes. I can pack in ten minutes. Thanks very much.”\r\n\r\n“Stout fellow. There’ll be shooting and all that sort of rot. Oh! by the\r\nway, are you any good at acting? I mean, I believe there are going to be\r\nprivate theatricals of sorts. A man called Charteris is getting them up.\r\nCambridge man; belongs to the Footlights. Always getting up theatricals.\r\nRot, I call it; but you can’t stop him. Do you do anything in that\r\nline?”\r\n\r\n“Put me down for what you like, from Emperor of Morocco to Confused\r\nNoise Without. I was on the stage once. I’m particularly good at\r\nshifting scenery.”\r\n\r\n“Good for you. Well, so long. Two-fifteen from Paddington, remember.\r\nI’ll meet you there. I’ve got to go and see a fellow now.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll look out for you.”\r\n\r\nA sudden thought occurred to Jimmy. Spike! He had forgotten Spike for\r\nthe moment. It was vital that the Bowery boy should not be lost sight of\r\nagain. He was the one link with the little house somewhere beyond One\r\nHundred and Fiftieth Street. He could not leave the Bowery boy at the\r\nflat. A vision rose in his mind of Spike alone in London with Savoy\r\nMansions as a base for his operations. No; Spike must be transplanted to\r\nthe country. He could not seem to see Spike in the country. His boredom\r\nwould probably be pathetic. But it was the only way.\r\n\r\nLord Dreever facilitated matters.\r\n\r\n“By the way, Pitt,” he said, “you’ve got a man of sorts, of course? One\r\nof those frightful fellows who forget to pack your collars! Bring him\r\nalong, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said Jimmy. “I will.”\r\n\r\nThe matter had scarcely been settled when the door opened and revealed\r\nthe subject of discussion. Wearing a broad grin of mingled pride and\r\nbashfulness, and looking very stiff and awkward in one of the brightest\r\ntweed suits ever seen off the stage, Spike stood for a moment in the\r\ndoorway to let his appearance sink into the spectator; then advanced\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n“How do dese strike you, boss?” he inquired genially, as Lord Dreever\r\ngaped in astonishment at this bright being.\r\n\r\n“Pretty nearly blind, Spike,” said Jimmy. “What made you get those? We\r\nuse electric light here.”\r\n\r\nSpike was full of news.\r\n\r\n“Say, boss, dat clothing-store’s a willy wonder, sure. De old mug what\r\nshowed me round give me de frozen face when I came in foist. ‘What’s\r\ndoin’?’ he says. ‘To de woods wit you! git de hook!’ But I hands out de\r\nplunks you give me, an’ tells him how I’m here to get a dude suit, an’\r\ngee! if he don’t haul out suits by de mile. Give me a toist, it did,\r\nwatching him. ‘It’s up to youse,’ says de mug. ‘Choose somet’ing. You\r\npays de money, an’ we does de rest.’ So I says dis is de one, and I put\r\ndown de plunks, an’ here I am, boss.”\r\n\r\n“I noticed that, Spike,” said Jimmy. “I could see you in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you like de duds, boss?” inquired Spike anxiously.\r\n\r\n“They’re the last word,” said Jimmy. “You’d make Solomon in all his\r\nglory look like a tramp cyclist.”\r\n\r\n“Dat’s right,” agreed Spike. “Dey’se de limit.”\r\n\r\nAnd, apparently oblivious to the presence of Lord Dreever, who had been\r\nwatching him in blank silence since his entrance, the Bowery boy\r\nproceeded to execute a mysterious shuffling dance on the carpet.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the overwrought brain of his lordship.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Pitt,” he said; “I’m off. Got to see a man.”\r\n\r\nJimmy saw him to the door.\r\n\r\nOutside, Lord Dreever placed the palm of his right hand on his forehead.\r\n\r\n“I say, Pitt,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Halloa!”\r\n\r\n“Who the devil’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Who? Spike? Oh, that’s my man.”\r\n\r\n“Your man! Is he always like that?—I mean going on like a frightful\r\nmusic-hall comedian, dancing, you know? And, I say, what on earth\r\nlanguage was that he was talking? I couldn’t understand one word in\r\nten.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s American—the Bowery variety.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Well, I suppose it’s all right if you understand it. I can’t. By\r\nGad!” he broke off, with a chuckle, “I’d give something to see him\r\ntalking to old Saunders, our butler at home. He’s got the manners of a\r\nduke.”\r\n\r\n“Spike should revise those,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“What do you call him?”\r\n\r\n“Spike.”\r\n\r\n“Rummy name, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Fashionable in the States; short for Algernon.”\r\n\r\n“He seemed pretty chummy.”\r\n\r\n“That’s his independent bringing-up. They’re all like that in America.”\r\n\r\n“Jolly country.”\r\n\r\n“You’d love it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so long.”\r\n\r\n“So long.”\r\n\r\nOn the bottom step Lord Dreever halted.\r\n\r\n“I say, I’ve got it!”\r\n\r\n“Good for you; got what?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I knew I’d seen that chap’s face somewhere before, only I couldn’t\r\nplace him. I’ve got him now. He’s the Johnny who came into the shelter\r\nlast night—chap you gave a quid to.”\r\n\r\nSpike’s was one of those faces which, without being essentially\r\nbeautiful, stamp themselves on the memory.\r\n\r\n“You’re quite right,” said Jimmy. “I was wondering if you would\r\nrecognise him. Would you prefer a cigar or a cocoanut? The fact is, he’s\r\na man I once employed over in New York, and when I came across him over\r\nhere he was so evidently wanting a bit of help that I took him on again.\r\nAs a matter of fact I needed somebody to look after my things, and Spike\r\ncan do it as well as anybody else.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Not bad my spotting him, was it? Well, I must be off. Good-bye.\r\nTwo-fifteen at Paddington. Meet you there. Book for Dreever if you’re\r\nthere before me.”\r\n\r\n“Right. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nJimmy returned to the dining-room. Spike, who was examining as much as\r\nhe could of himself in the glass, turned round with his wonted grin.\r\n\r\n“Say, who’s de gazebo, boss? Ain’t he de mug youse was wit last night?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the man. We’re going down with him to the country to-day, Spike,\r\nso be ready.”\r\n\r\n“On your way, boss. What’s dat?”\r\n\r\n“He has invited us to his country house, and we’re going.”\r\n\r\n“What? Bote of us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I told him you were my servant. I hope you aren’t offended.”\r\n\r\n“Nit. What’s dere to be offended at, boss?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right. Well, we’d better be packing. We have to be at the\r\nstation at a quarter to two.”\r\n\r\n“Sure.”\r\n\r\n“And, Spike.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, boss?”\r\n\r\n“Did you get any other clothes besides what you’ve got on?”\r\n\r\n“Nit. What do I want wit more dan one dude suit?”\r\n\r\n“I approve of your rugged simplicity,” said Jimmy, “but what you’re\r\nwearing is a town suit, excellent for the Park or the Marchioness’s\r\nThursday crush, but essentially metropolitan. You must get something\r\nelse for the country, something dark and quiet. I’ll come and help you\r\nchoose it, now.”\r\n\r\n“Why, won’t dis go in de country?”\r\n\r\n“Not on your life, Spike. It would unsettle the rustic mind. They’re\r\nfearfully particular about that sort of thing in England.”\r\n\r\n“Dey’s to de bad,” said the baffled disciple of Beau Brummell, with deep\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\n“And there’s just one thing more, Spike. I know you’ll excuse me\r\nmentioning it. When we’re at Dreever Castle you will find yourself\r\nwithin reach of a good deal of silver and other things. Would it be too\r\nmuch to ask you to forget your professional instincts? I mentioned this\r\nbefore in a general sort of way, but this is a particular case.”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t I to get busy at all, den?” queried Spike.\r\n\r\n“Not so much as a salt-spoon,” said Jimmy firmly. “Now we’ll whistle a\r\ncab and go and choose you some more clothes.”\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Spike, who came within an ace of looking almost\r\nrespectable in new blue serge (“small gent’s”—off the peg), Jimmy\r\narrived at Paddington with a quarter of an hour to spare. Lord Dreever\r\nappeared ten minutes later, accompanied by a man of about Jimmy’s age.\r\nHe was tall and thin, with cold eyes and tight, thin lips. His clothes\r\nfitted him in the way clothes do fit one man in a thousand. They were\r\nthe best part of him. His general appearance gave one the idea that his\r\nmeals did him little good, and his meditations rather less. He had\r\npractically no conversation.\r\n\r\nThis was Lord Dreever’s friend Hargate—the Hon. Louis Hargate. Lord\r\nDreever made the two acquainted; but even as they shook hands Jimmy had\r\nan impression that he had seen the man before, but where or in what\r\ncircumstances he could not remember. Hargate appeared to have no\r\nrecollection of him, so he did not mention the matter. A man who has led\r\na wandering life often sees faces which come back to him later on,\r\nabsolutely detached from their context. He might merely have passed Lord\r\nDreever’s friend in the street. But Jimmy had an idea that the other had\r\nfigured in some episode which at the moment had had an importance.\r\n\r\nWhat that episode was had escaped him. He dismissed the thing from his\r\nmind. It was not worth harrying his memory about.\r\n\r\nJudicious tipping had secured them a compartment to themselves. Hargate,\r\nhaving read the evening paper, went to sleep in the far corner. Jimmy\r\nand Lord Dreever, who sat opposite one another, fell into a desultory\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nAt Reading Lord Dreever’s remarks took a somewhat intimate turn. Jimmy\r\nwas one of those men whose manner invites confidences. His lordship\r\nbegan to unburden his soul of certain facts relating to the family.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever met my Uncle Thomas?” he inquired. “You know Blunt’s\r\nStores? Well, he’s Blunt. It’s a company now, but he still runs it. He\r\nmarried my aunt. You’ll meet him at Dreever.”\r\n\r\nJimmy said he would be delighted.\r\n\r\n“I bet you won’t,” said the last of the Dreevers, with candour. “He’s a\r\nfrightful man—the limit. Always fussing round like a hen. Gives me a\r\nfearful time, I can tell you. Look here, I don’t mind telling you—we’re\r\npals—he’s dead set on my marrying a rich girl.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that sounds all right. There are worse hobbies. Any particular\r\nrich girl?”\r\n\r\n“There’s always one. He sticks me on to one after another. Quite nice\r\ngirls, you know, some of them, only I want to marry somebody else—that\r\ngirl you saw me with at the Savoy.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you tell your uncle?”\r\n\r\n“He’d have a fit. She hasn’t a penny. Nor have I, except what I get from\r\nhim. Of course, this is strictly between ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“I know everybody thinks there’s money attached to the title; but there\r\nisn’t—not a penny. When my Aunt Julia married Sir Thomas the whole\r\nfrightful show was pretty well in pawn. So you see how it is.”\r\n\r\n“Ever think of work?” asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Work?” said Lord Dreever reflectively. “Well, you know, I shouldn’t\r\nmind work, only I’m dashed if I can see what I could do. I shouldn’t\r\nknow how. Nowadays you want a fearful specialised education, and so on.\r\nTell you what, though, I shouldn’t mind the Diplomatic Service. One of\r\nthese days I shall have a dash at asking my uncle to put up the money. I\r\nbelieve I shouldn’t be half bad at that. I’m rather a quick sort of chap\r\nat times you know. Lots of fellows have said so.”\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat modestly, and proceeded.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t only my Uncle Thomas,” he said; “there’s Aunt Julia too. She’s\r\nabout as much the limit as he is. I remember when I was a kid she was\r\nalways sitting on me. She does still. Wait till you see her. Sort of\r\nwoman who makes you feel that your hands are the colour of tomatoes and\r\nthe size of legs of mutton, if you know what I mean. And talks as if she\r\nwere biting at you. Frightful!”\r\n\r\nHaving unburdened himself of which criticism, he yawned, leaned back,\r\nand was presently asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour later that the train, which had been taking itself\r\nless seriously for some time, stopping at all stations of quite minor\r\nimportance, and generally showing a tendency to dawdle, halted again. A\r\nboard with the legend “Dreever” in large letters showed that they had\r\nreached their destination.\r\n\r\nThe station-master informed Lord Dreever that her ladyship had come to\r\nmeet the train in the motor car, and was now waiting in the road\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nLord Dreever’s jaw fell.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord!” he said. “She’s probably motored in to get the afternoon\r\nletters. That means she’s come in the runabout, and there’s only room\r\nfor two of us in that. I forgot to write that you were coming, Pitt. I\r\nonly wired about Hargate. Dash it, I shall have to walk.”\r\n\r\nHis fears proved correct. The car at the station-door was small. It was\r\nobviously designed to seat four only.\r\n\r\nLord Dreever introduced Hargate and Jimmy to the statuesque lady in the\r\ntonneau, and then there was an awkward silence.\r\n\r\nAt this point Spike came up, chuckling amiably, with a magazine in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Gee!” said Spike. “Say, boss, de mug what wrote dis piece must have bin\r\nlivin’ out in de woods. Say, dere’s a gazebo who wants to swipe de\r\nheroine’s jools what’s locked in a drawer. So dis mug—what do you t’ink\r\nhe does?” Spike laughed shortly, in professional scorn. “Why——”\r\n\r\n“Is this gentleman a friend of yours, Spennie?” inquired Lady Julia\r\npolitely, eyeing the red-haired speaker coldly.\r\n\r\n“It’s——”\r\n\r\nHe looked appealingly at Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“It’s my man,” said Jimmy. “Spike,” he added, in an undertone, “to the\r\nwoods. Chase yourself. Fade away.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said the abashed Spike. “Dat’s right. It ain’t up to me to come\r\nbuttin’ in. Sorry, boss. Sorry, gents. Sorry, loidy. Me for the tall\r\ngrass.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a luggage cart of sorts,” said Lord Dreever, pointing.\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said Spike, affably. He trotted away.\r\n\r\n“Jump in, Pitt,” said Lord Dreever. “I’m going to walk.”\r\n\r\n“No, I’ll walk,” said Jimmy. “I’d rather. I want a bit of exercise.\r\nWhich way do I go?”\r\n\r\n“Frightfully good of you, old chap,” said Lord Dreever. “Sure you don’t\r\nmind? I do bar walking. Right-O! You keep straight on.”\r\n\r\nJimmy watched them out of sight and started to follow at a leisurely\r\npace. It certainly was an ideal afternoon for a country walk. The sun\r\nwas just hesitating whether to treat the time as afternoon or evening.\r\nEventually it decided that it was evening and moderated its beams. After\r\nLondon the country was deliciously fresh and cool. Jimmy felt an\r\nunwonted content. It seemed to him just then that the only thing worth\r\ndoing in the world was to settle down somewhere with three acres and a\r\ncow and become pastoral.\r\n\r\nThere was a marked lack of traffic on the road. Once he met a cart and\r\nonce a flock of sheep with a friendly dog. Sometimes a rabbit would dash\r\nout into the road, stop to listen, and dart into the opposite hedge, all\r\nhind-legs and white scut. But except for these he was alone in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAnd gradually there began to be borne in upon him the conviction that he\r\nhad lost his way.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to judge distance when one is walking but it certainly\r\nseemed to Jimmy that he must have covered five miles by this time. He\r\nmust have mistaken the way. He had certainly come straight; he could not\r\nhave come straighter. On the other hand, it would be quite in keeping\r\nwith the cheap substitute which served the Earl of Dreever in place of a\r\nmind that he should have forgotten to mention some important turning.\r\nJimmy sat down by the roadside.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there came to him from down the road the sound of a horse’s\r\nfeet trotting. He got up. Here was somebody at last who would direct\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Halloa!” he said. “Accident? And, by Jove, a side-saddle!”\r\n\r\nJimmy stopped the horse, and led it back the way it had come. As he\r\nturned the bend in the road he saw a girl in a riding-habit running\r\ntowards him. She stopped running when she caught sight of him, and\r\nslowed down to walk.\r\n\r\n“Thank you ever so much,” she said, taking the reins from him. “Dandy,\r\nyou naughty old thing!”\r\n\r\nJimmy looked at her flushed, smiling face, and stood staring. It was\r\nMolly McEachern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 12 ★\r\n                            _Making a Start_\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-possession was one of Jimmy’s leading characteristics, but for the\r\nmoment he found himself speechless. This girl had been occupying his\r\nthoughts for so long that—in his mind—he had grown very intimate with\r\nher. It was something of a shock to come suddenly out of his dreams and\r\nface the fact that she was in reality practically a stranger. He felt as\r\none might with a friend whose memory has been wiped out. It went against\r\nthe grain to have to begin again from the beginning after all the time\r\nthey had been together.\r\n\r\nA curious constraint fell upon him.\r\n\r\n“Why, how do you do, Mr. Pitt?” she said, holding out her hand.\r\n\r\nJimmy began to feel better. It was something that she remembered his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n“It’s like meeting somebody out of a dream,” said Molly. “I have\r\nsometimes wondered if you were real. Everything that happened that night\r\nwas so like a dream.”\r\n\r\nJimmy found his tongue.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t altered,” he said; “you look just the same.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” she laughed, “after all, it’s not so long ago, is it?”\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of a dull hurt. To him it had seemed years. But he was\r\nnothing to her—just an acquaintance, one of a hundred. But what more, he\r\nasked himself, could he have expected? And with the thought came\r\nconsolation. The painful sense of having lost ground left him. He saw he\r\nhad been allowing things to get out of proportion. He had not lost\r\nground. He had gained it. He had met her again and she remembered him.\r\nWhat more had he any right to ask?\r\n\r\n“I’ve crammed a good deal into the time,” he explained. “I’ve been\r\ntravelling about a bit since we met.”\r\n\r\n“Do you live in Shropshire?” asked Molly.\r\n\r\n“No. I’m on a visit—at least, I’m supposed to be; but I’ve lost the way\r\nto the place, and I am beginning to doubt if I shall ever get there. I\r\nwas told to go straight on. I’ve gone straight on, and here I am, lost\r\nin the snow. Do you happen to know whereabouts Dreever Castle is?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n“Why,” she said, “I’m staying at Dreever Castle myself.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“So the first person you meet turns out to be an experienced guide.\r\nYou’re lucky, Mr. Pitt.”\r\n\r\n“You’re right,” said Jimmy slowly; “I am.”\r\n\r\n“Did you come down with Lord Dreever? He passed me in the car just as I\r\nwas starting out. He was with another man and Lady Julia Blunt. Surely\r\nhe didn’t make you walk?”\r\n\r\n“I offered to walk. Somebody had to. Apparently he had forgotten to let\r\nthem know he was bringing me.”\r\n\r\n“And then he misdirected you! He’s very casual, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Inclined that way, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“Have you known Lord Dreever long?”\r\n\r\n“Since a quarter-past twelve last night.”\r\n\r\n“Last night!”\r\n\r\n“We met at the Savoy, and later on the Embankment. We looked at the\r\nriver together and told each other the painful stories of our lives, and\r\nthis morning he called and invited me down here.”\r\n\r\nMolly looked at him with frank amusement.\r\n\r\n“You must be a very restless sort of person,” she said. “You seem to do\r\na great deal of moving about.”\r\n\r\n“I do,” said Jimmy. “I can’t keep still. I’ve got the go-fever, like the\r\nman in Kipling’s book.”\r\n\r\n“But he was in love.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jimmy; “he was. That’s the bacillus, you know.”\r\n\r\nShe shot a quick glance at him. He became suddenly interesting to her.\r\nShe was at the age of dreams and speculations. From being merely an\r\nordinary young man with rather more ease of manner than the majority of\r\nthe young men she had met, he developed in an instant into something\r\nworthy of closer attention. He took on a certain mystery and romance.\r\nShe wondered what sort of a girl it was that he loved. Examining him in\r\nthe light of this new discovery, she found him attractive. Something\r\nseemed to have happened to put her in sympathy with him. She noticed for\r\nthe first time a latent forcefulness behind the pleasantness of his\r\nmanner. His self-possession was the self-possession of the man who had\r\nbeen tried and has found himself.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of her consciousness, too, there was a faint stirring of\r\nsome emotion, which she could not analyse, not unlike pain. It was\r\nvaguely reminiscent of the agony of loneliness which she had experienced\r\nas a small child on the rare occasions when her father had been busy and\r\ndistrait and had shown her by his manner that she was outside his\r\nthoughts. This was but a pale suggestion of that misery, but\r\nnevertheless there was a resemblance. It was a rather desolate, shut-out\r\nsensation, half resentful.\r\n\r\nIt was gone in a moment. But it had been there. It had passed over her\r\nheart as the shadow of a cloud moves across a meadow in the summer-time.\r\n\r\nFor some moments she stood without speaking. Jimmy did not break the\r\nsilence. He was looking at her with an appeal in his eyes. Why could she\r\nnot understand? She must understand.\r\n\r\nBut the eyes that met his were those of a child.\r\n\r\nAs they stood there the horse, which had been cropping in a perfunctory\r\nmanner at the short grass by the roadside, raised his head and neighed\r\nimpatiently. There was something so human about the performance that\r\nJimmy and the girl laughed simultaneously. The utter materialism of the\r\nneigh broke the spell. It was a noisy demand for food.\r\n\r\n“Poor Dandy!” said Molly. “He knows he’s near home, and he knows it’s\r\nhis dinner-time.”\r\n\r\n“Are we near the castle, then?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a long way round by the road, but we can cut across the fields.\r\nAren’t these English fields and hedges just perfect? I love them! Of\r\ncourse I loved America, but——”\r\n\r\n“Have you left New York long?” asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“We came over here about a month after you were at our house.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t spend much time there, then?”\r\n\r\n“Father had just made a good deal of money in Wall Street. He must have\r\nbeen making it when I was on the _Mauretania_. He wanted to leave New\r\nYork, so we didn’t wait. We were in London all the winter. Then we went\r\nover to Paris. It was there we met Sir Thomas Blunt and Lady Julia. Have\r\nyou met them? They are Lord Dreever’s uncle and aunt.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve met Lady Julia.”\r\n\r\n“Do you like her?”\r\n\r\nJimmy hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see——”\r\n\r\n“I know. She’s your hostess, but you haven’t started your visit yet, so\r\nyou’ve just got time to say what you really think of her before you have\r\nto pretend she’s perfect.”\r\n\r\n“Well——”\r\n\r\n“I detest her,” said Molly crisply. “I think she’s hard and hateful.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I can’t say she struck me as a sort of female Cheeryble Brother.\r\nLord Dreever introduced me to her at the station. She seemed to bear it\r\npluckily, but with some difficulty.”\r\n\r\n“She’s hateful,” repeated Molly. “So is he—Sir Thomas, I mean. He’s one\r\nof those fussy, bullying little men. They both bully poor Lord Dreever\r\ntill I wonder he doesn’t rebel. They treat him like a schoolboy. It\r\nmakes me wild. It’s such a shame. He’s so nice and good-natured. I am so\r\nsorry for him.”\r\n\r\nJimmy listened to this outburst with mixed feelings. It was sweet of her\r\nto be so sympathetic; but was it merely sympathy? There had been a ring\r\nin her voice and a flush on her cheek which had suggested to Jimmy’s\r\nsensitive mind a personal interest in the down-trodden peer. Reason told\r\nhim that it was foolish to be jealous of Lord Dreever. A good fellow, of\r\ncourse, but not to be taken seriously. The primitive man in him, on the\r\nother hand, made him hate all Molly’s male friends with an unreasoning\r\nhatred. Not that he hated Lord Dreever. He liked him. But he doubted if\r\nhe could go on liking him for long if Molly were to continue in this\r\nsympathetic strain.\r\n\r\nHis affection for the absent one was not put to the test. Molly’s next\r\nremark had to do with Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n“The worst of it is,” she said, “father and Sir Thomas are such friends.\r\nIn Paris they were always together. Father did him a very good turn.”\r\n\r\n“How was that?”\r\n\r\n“It was one afternoon just after we arrived. A man got into Lady Julia’s\r\nroom while we were all out except father. Father saw him go into the\r\nroom, and suspecting something was wrong, went in after him. The man was\r\ntrying to steal Lady Julia’s jewels. He had opened the box where they\r\nwere kept, and was actually holding her rope of diamonds in his hand\r\nwhen father found him. It’s the most magnificent thing I ever saw. Sir\r\nThomas told father he gave a hundred thousand dollars for it.”\r\n\r\n“But surely,” said Jimmy, “hadn’t the management of the hotel a safe for\r\nvaluables?”\r\n\r\n“Of course they had; but you don’t know Sir Thomas. He wasn’t going to\r\ntrust any hotel safe. He’s the sort of man who insists on doing\r\neverything in his own way, and who always imagines he can do things\r\nbetter for himself than anyone else can do them for him. He had had this\r\nspecial box made, and would never keep the diamonds anywhere else.\r\nNaturally the thief opened it in a minute. A clever thief would have no\r\ndifficulty with a thing like that.”\r\n\r\n“What happened?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the man saw father and dropped the jewels, and ran off down the\r\ncorridor. Father chased him a little way, but, of course, it was no\r\ngood; so he went back and shouted and rang every bell he could see and\r\ngave the alarm, but the man was never found. Still, he left the\r\ndiamonds. That was the great thing, after all. You must look at them\r\nto-night at dinner. They really are wonderful. Are you a judge of\r\nprecious stones at all?”\r\n\r\n“I am, rather,” said Jimmy; “in fact, a jeweller I once knew told me I\r\nhad a natural gift in that direction. And so, of course, Sir Thomas was\r\npretty grateful to your father?”\r\n\r\n“He simply gushed. He couldn’t do enough for him. You see, if the\r\ndiamonds had been stolen I’m sure Lady Julia would have made Sir Thomas\r\nbuy her another rope just as good. He’s terrified of her, I’m certain.\r\nHe tries not to show it; but he is. And besides having to pay another\r\nhundred thousand dollars, he would never have heard the last of it. It\r\nwould have ruined his reputation for being infallible and doing\r\neverything better than anybody else.”\r\n\r\n“But didn’t the mere fact that the thief got the jewels and was only\r\nstopped by a fluke from getting away with them do that?”\r\n\r\nMolly bubbled with laughter.\r\n\r\n“She never knew. Sir Thomas got back to the hotel an hour before she\r\ndid. I’ve never seen such a busy hour. He had the manager up and\r\nharangued him, and swore him to secrecy—which the poor manager was only\r\ntoo glad to agree to, because it wouldn’t have done the hotel any good\r\nto have it known. And the manager harangued the servants, and the\r\nservants harangued each other, and everybody talked at the same time,\r\nand father and I promised not to tell a soul; so Lady Julia doesn’t know\r\na word about it to this day. And I don’t see why she ever should; though\r\none of these days I’ve a good mind to tell Lord Dreever! Think what a\r\nhold he would have over them! They’d never be able to bully him again.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t,” said Jimmy, trying to keep a touch of coldness out of his\r\nvoice. This championship of Lord Dreever, however sweet and admirable,\r\nwas a little distressing.\r\n\r\nShe looked up quickly.\r\n\r\n“You don’t think I really meant to, do you?”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Jimmy hastily. “Of course not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I should think so!” said Molly indignantly. “After I promised not\r\nto tell a soul about it.”\r\n\r\nJimmy chuckled.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing,” he said, in answer to her look of inquiry.\r\n\r\n“You laughed at something.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jimmy apologetically, “it’s only—it’s nothing really—only\r\nwhat I meant is, you have just told one soul a good deal about it,\r\nhaven’t you?”\r\n\r\nMolly turned pink. Then she smiled.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how I came to do it,” she declared. “It rushed out of its\r\nown accord. I suppose it is because I know I can trust you.”\r\n\r\nJimmy flushed with pleasure. He turned to her and half halted, but she\r\ncontinued to walk on.\r\n\r\n“You can,” he said; “but how do you know you can?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” she said—she stopped for a moment, and then went on hurriedly,\r\nwith a touch of embarrassment—“why, how absurd! Of course I know. Can’t\r\nyou read faces? I can. Look,” she said, pointing, “now you can see the\r\ncastle. How do you like it?”\r\n\r\nThey had reached a point where the fields sloped sharply downward. A few\r\nhundred yards away, backed by woods, stood the grey mass of stone which\r\nproved such a kill-joy of old to the Welsh sportsman during the peasant\r\nseason. Even now it had a certain air of defiance. The setting sun lit\r\nup the waters of the lake. No figures were to be seen moving in the\r\ngrounds. The place resembled a palace of sleep.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Molly.\r\n\r\n“It’s wonderful!”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it? I’m so glad it strikes you like that. I always feel as if I\r\nhad invented everything round here. It hurts me if people don’t\r\nappreciate it.”\r\n\r\nThey went down the hill.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said Jimmy, “are you acting in these theatricals they are\r\ngetting up?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Are you the other man they were going to get? That’s why Lord\r\nDreever went up to London, to see if he couldn’t find somebody. The man\r\nwho was going to play one of the parts had to go back to London on\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“Poor brute!” said Jimmy. It seemed to him at that moment that there was\r\nonly one place in the world where a man might be even reasonably happy.\r\n“What sort of part is it? Lord Dreever said I should be wanted to act.\r\nWhat do I do?”\r\n\r\n“If you’re Lord Herbert, which is the part they wanted a man for, you\r\ntalk to me most of the time.”\r\n\r\nJimmy decided that the piece had been well cast.\r\n\r\nThe dressing-gong sounded just as they entered the hall. From a door on\r\nthe left there emerged two men—a big one and a little one—in friendly\r\nconversation. The big man’s back struck Jimmy as familiar.\r\n\r\n“Oh, father!” Molly called. And Jimmy knew where he had seen the back\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“Sir Thomas,” said Molly, “this is Mr. Pitt.”\r\n\r\nThe little man gave Jimmy a rapid glance—possibly with the object of\r\ndetecting his more immediately obvious criminal points; then, as if\r\nsatisfied as to his honesty, became genial.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Pitt—very glad,” he said. “We have been\r\nexpecting you for some time.”\r\n\r\nJimmy explained that he had lost his way.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. It was ridiculous that you should be compelled to\r\nwalk—perfectly ridiculous. It was gross carelessness of my nephew not to\r\nlet us know that you were coming. My wife told him so in the car.”\r\n\r\n“I bet she did,” said Jimmy to himself. “Really,” he said aloud, by way\r\nof lending a helping hand to a friend in trouble, “I preferred to walk.\r\nI have not been on a country road since I landed in England.” He turned\r\nto the big man and held out his hand. “I don’t suppose you remember me,\r\nMr. McEachern. We met in New York.”\r\n\r\n“You remember the night Mr. Pitt scared away our burglar, father?” said\r\nMolly.\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern was momentarily silent. On his native asphalt there are\r\nfew situations capable of throwing the New York policeman off his\r\nbalance. In that favoured clime _savoir-faire_ is represented by a\r\nshrewd blow of the fist, and a masterful stroke with the truncheon\r\namounts to a satisfactory repartee. Thus shall you never take a\r\npoliceman of Manhattan without his answer. In other surroundings Mr.\r\nMcEachern would have known how to deal with the young man whom with such\r\ngood reason he believed to be an expert criminal. But another plan of\r\naction was needed here. First and foremost of all the hints on etiquette\r\nwhich he had imbibed since he entered this more reposeful life came this\r\nmaxim, “Never make a scene.” Scenes, he had gathered, were of all things\r\nwhat polite society most resolutely abhorred. The natural man in him\r\nmust be bound in chains. The sturdy blow must give way to the honeyed\r\nword. A cold “Really!” was the most vigorous retort that the best\r\ncircles would countenance.\r\n\r\nIt had cost Mr. McEachern some pains to learn this lesson, but he had\r\ndone it.\r\n\r\nHe shook hands and gruffly acknowledged the acquaintanceship.\r\n\r\n“Really, really!” chirped Sir Thomas amiably. “So you find yourself\r\namong old friends, Mr. Pitt.”\r\n\r\n“Old friends,” echoed Jimmy, painfully conscious of the ex-policeman’s\r\neyes, which were boring holes in him.\r\n\r\n“Excellent, excellent! Let me take you to your room. It is just opposite\r\nmy own. This way.”\r\n\r\nThey parted from Mr. McEachern on the first landing, but Jimmy could\r\nstill feel those eyes. The policeman’s stare had been of the sort which\r\nturns corners, goes upstairs, and pierces walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 13 ★\r\n                            _Spike’s Views_\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was in a very exalted frame of mind that he dressed for\r\ndinner. It seemed to him that he had awakened from a sort of stupor.\r\nLife, so grey yesterday, now appeared full of colour and possibilities.\r\nMost men who, either from choice or necessity, have knocked about the\r\nworld for any length of time are more or less fatalists. Jimmy was an\r\noptimistic fatalist. He had always looked on fate not as a blind\r\ndispenser at random of gifts good and bad, but rather as a benevolent\r\nbeing with a pleasing bias in his favour. He had almost a Napoleonic\r\nfaith in his star. At various periods of his life—notably at the time\r\nwhen, as he had told Lord Dreever, he had breakfasted on birdseed—he had\r\nbeen in uncommonly tight corners, but his luck had always extricated\r\nhim. It struck him that it would be an unthinkable piece of bad\r\nsportsmanship on Fate’s part to see him through so much and then to\r\nabandon him just as he had arrived in sight of what was by far the\r\nbiggest thing of his life. Of course, his view of what constituted the\r\nbiggest thing in life had changed with the years. Every ridge of the\r\nHill of Supreme Moments in turn had been mistaken by him for the summit;\r\nbut this last, he felt instinctively, was genuine. For good or bad,\r\nMolly was woven into the texture of his life. In the stormy period of\r\nthe early twenties he had thought the same of other girls, who were now\r\nmere memories as dim as those of figures in a half-forgotten play. In\r\ntheir case his convalescence had been temporarily painful, but brief.\r\nForce of will and an active life had worked the cure. He had merely\r\nbraced himself up and firmly ejected them from his mind. A week or two\r\nof aching emptiness, and his heart had been once more in readiness—all\r\nnicely swept and done up—for the next lodger.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of Molly it was different. He had passed the age of\r\ninstantaneous susceptibility. Like a landlord who had been cheated by\r\nprevious tenants, he had become wary. He mistrusted his powers of\r\nrecuperation in case of disaster. The will in these matters, just like\r\nthe mundane “bouncer”, gets past his work. For some years now Jimmy had\r\nhad a feeling that the next arrival would come to stay, and he had\r\nadopted, in consequence, a gently defensive attitude towards the other\r\nsex. Molly had broken through this, and he saw that his estimate of his\r\nwillpower had been just. Methods which had proved excellent in the past\r\nwere useless now. There was no trace here of that dimly-consoling\r\nfeeling of earlier years that there were other girls in the world. He\r\ndid not try to deceive himself. He knew that he had passed the age when\r\na man can fall in love with any one of a number of types.\r\n\r\nThis was the finish, one way or the other. There was no second throw.\r\nShe had him. However it might end, he belonged to her.\r\n\r\nThere are few moments in a man’s day when his brain is more\r\ncontemplative than during that brief space when he is lathering his face\r\npreparatory to shaving. Flying the brush, Jimmy reviewed the situation.\r\nHe was perhaps a little too optimistic. Not unnaturally he was inclined\r\nto look upon his luck as a sort of special train which would convey him\r\nwithout effort to Paradise. Fate had behaved so exceedingly handsomely\r\nup till now. By a series of the most workmanlike miracles it had brought\r\nhim to the point of being Molly’s fellow-guest at a country-house. This,\r\nas Reason coldly pointed out a few moments later, was merely the\r\nbeginning; but to Jimmy, thoughtfully lathering, it seemed the end. It\r\nwas only when he had finished shaving and was arranging his tie that he\r\nbegan to perceive that there were obstacles in his way—and sufficiently\r\nbig obstacles at that.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Molly did not love him. And, he was bound to admit,\r\nthere was no earthly reason why she ever should. A man in love is seldom\r\nvain about his personal attractions. Also, her father firmly believed\r\nhim to be a master-burglar.\r\n\r\n“Otherwise,” said Jimmy, scowling at his reflection in the glass,\r\n“everything’s splendid.”\r\n\r\nHe brushed his hair sadly.\r\n\r\nThere was a furtive rap at the door.\r\n\r\n“Halloa?” said Jimmy. “Yes?”\r\n\r\nThe door opened slowly. A grin, surmounted by a mop of red hair,\r\nappeared round the edge of it.\r\n\r\n“Halloa, Spike! Come in. What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nThe rest of Mr. Mullins entered the room.\r\n\r\n“Gee, boss, I wasn’t sure dis was your room. Say, who do you t’ink I\r\nnearly bumped me coco against out in de corridor downstairs? Why, old\r\nman McEachern, de cop. Dat’s right!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Say, what’s he doin’ on dis beat? I pretty near went down and out\r\nwhen I seen him. Dat’s right. Me breath ain’t got back home yet.”\r\n\r\n“Did he recognise you?”\r\n\r\n“Did he! He starts like an actor on top de stoige when he sees he’s up\r\nagainst de plot to ruin him, an’ he gives me de fierce eye.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I was wondering was I on Third Avenue, or was I standing on me coco, or\r\nwhat was I doin’ anyhow. Den I slips off and chases meself up here. Say,\r\nboss, what’s de game? What’s old man McEachern doin’ stunts dis side\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, Spike. Keep calm. I can explain. He has retired—like\r\nme. He’s one of the handsome guests here.”\r\n\r\n“On your way, boss! What’s dat?”\r\n\r\n“He left the Force just after that merry meeting of ours when you\r\nfrolicked with the bulldog. He came over here and butted into society.\r\nSo here we are again, all gathered together under the same roof, like a\r\njolly little family party.”\r\n\r\nSpike’s open mouth bore witness to his amazement.\r\n\r\n“Den——” he stammered.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Den what’s he goin’ to do?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t say. I’m expecting to hear shortly. But we needn’t worry\r\nourselves. The next move’s with him. If he wants to comment on the\r\nsituation he won’t be backward. He’ll come and do it.”\r\n\r\n“Sure. It’s up to him,” agreed Spike.\r\n\r\n“I’m quite comfortable. Speaking for myself, I’m having a good time. How\r\nare you getting along downstairs?”\r\n\r\n“De limit, boss. Honest, it’s to de velvet. Dere’s old gazebo, de\r\nbutler, Saunders his name is, dat’s de best ever at handing out long\r\nwoids. I sits and listens. Dey calls me Mr. Mullins down dere,” said\r\nSpike with pride.\r\n\r\n“Good. I’m glad you’re all right. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t\r\nhave an excellent time here. I don’t think that Mr. McEachern will try\r\nto have us turned out, after he’s heard one or two little things I have\r\nto say to him—just a few reminiscences of the past which may interest\r\nhim. I have the greatest affection for Mr. McEachern—I wish it was\r\nmutual—but nothing he can say is going to make me stir from here.”\r\n\r\n“Not on your life,” agreed Spike. “Say, boss, he must have got a lot of\r\nplunks to be able to butt in here. And I know how he got dem, too. Dat’s\r\nright. I comes from little old New York meself.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Spike; this is scandal!”\r\n\r\n“Sure!” said the Bowery boy, doggedly, safely started now on his\r\nfavourite subject. “I knows, and youse knows, boss. Gee! I wish I’d bin\r\na cop. But I wasn’t tall enough. Dey’s de fellers wit de big bank-rolls!\r\nLook at dis old McEachern. Money to boin a wet dog wit he’s got, and\r\nnever a bit of woik for it from de start to de finish. An’ look at me,\r\nboss.”\r\n\r\n“I do, Spike; I do.”\r\n\r\n“Look at me. Getting busy all de year round, woiking to beat de band——”\r\n\r\n“In prisons oft,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Sure t’ing. And chased all roun’ de town. And den what? Why, to de bad\r\nat de end of it all. Say, it’s enough to make a feller——”\r\n\r\n“Turn honest!” said Jimmy. “That’s it, Spike—reform. You’ll be glad some\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nSpike seemed to be doubtful. He was silent for a moment; then, as if\r\nfollowing up a train of thought, he said:\r\n\r\n“Boss, dis is a fine big house.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen worse.”\r\n\r\n“Say, couldn’t we——?”\r\n\r\n“Spike!” said Jimmy warningly.\r\n\r\n“Well, couldn’t we?” said Spike doggedly. “It ain’t often youse butts\r\ninto a dead easy proposition like dis one. We shouldn’t have to do a\r\nt’ing excep’ git busy. De stuff’s just lying about, boss.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t wonder.”\r\n\r\n“Aw, it’s a waste to leave it.”\r\n\r\n“Spike,” said Jimmy. “I warned you of this. I begged you to be on your\r\nguard, to fight against your professional instincts. Be a man! Crush\r\nthem. Try to occupy your mind. Collect butterflies.”\r\n\r\nSpike shuffled in gloomy silence.\r\n\r\n“’Member dose jools you swiped from de Duchess?” he said, musingly.\r\n\r\n“The dear Duchess!” murmured Jimmy. “Ah, me!”\r\n\r\n“And de bank you busted?”\r\n\r\n“Those were happy days, Spike.”\r\n\r\n“Gee!” said the Bowery boy.\r\n\r\nHe paused. “Dat was to de good,” he said wistfully.\r\n\r\nJimmy arranged his tie at the mirror.\r\n\r\n“Dere’s a loidy here,” continued Spike, addressing the chest of drawers,\r\n“dat’s got a necklace of jools what’s worth a hundred t’ousand plunks.\r\nHonest, boss—a hundred t’ousand plunks. Saunders told me that—de old\r\ngazebo dat hands out de long woids. I says to him ‘Gee!’ and he says,\r\n‘Surest t’ing you know.’ A hundred t’ousand plunks!”\r\n\r\n“So I understand,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Shall I rubber around and find out where is dey kept, boss?”\r\n\r\n“Spike,” said Jimmy, “ask me no more. All this is in direct\r\ncontravention of our treaty respecting keeping our fingers off the\r\nspoons. You pain me. Desist.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry, boss. But dey’ll be willy-wonders, dem jools. A hundred t’ousand\r\nplunks! Dat’s going some, ain’t it? What’s dat dis side?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty thousand pounds.”\r\n\r\n“Gee! Can I help you wit de duds, boss?”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks, Spike. I’m through now. You might just give me a brush\r\ndown, though. No, not that. That’s a hair-brush. Try the big black one.”\r\n\r\n“Dis is a boid of a dude suit,” observed Spike, pausing in his labours.\r\n\r\n“Glad you like it, Spike. Rather _chic_, I think.”\r\n\r\n“It’s de limit. Excuse me, how much did it set you back, boss?”\r\n\r\n“Something like twelve guineas, I believe. I could look up the bill and\r\nlet you know.”\r\n\r\n“What’s dat—guineas? Is that more dan a pound?”\r\n\r\n“A shilling more. Why these higher mathematics?”\r\n\r\nSpike resumed his brushing.\r\n\r\n“What a lot of dude suits youse could get,” he observed meditatively,\r\n“if you had dem jools.” He became suddenly animated. He waved the\r\nclothes-brush. “Oh, you boss!” he cried. “What’s eatin’ you? Aw, it’s a\r\nshame not to. Come along, you boss. Say, what’s doin’? Why ain’t you\r\nsittin’ in at de game? Oh, you boss!”\r\n\r\nWhatever reply Jimmy might have made to this impassioned appeal was\r\nchecked by a sudden bang on the door. Almost immediately the handle\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n“Gee!” cried Spike. “It’s de cop.”\r\n\r\nJimmy smiled pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“Come in, Mr. McEachern,” he said, “come in. Journeys end in lovers\r\nmeeting. You know my friend Mr. Mullins, I think? Shut the door and sit\r\ndown, and let’s talk of many things.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 14 ★\r\n                      _Check, and a Counter Move_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern stood in the doorway, breathing heavily. As the result of\r\na long connection with evildoers, the ex-policeman was somewhat prone to\r\nharbour suspicions of those round about him, and at the present moment\r\nhis mind was aflame. Indeed, a more trusting man might have been excused\r\nfor feeling a little doubtful as to the intentions of Jimmy and Spike.\r\nWhen McEachern had heard that Lord Dreever had brought home a casual\r\nLondon acquaintance, he had suspected as a possible drawback to the\r\nvisit the existence of hidden motives on the part of the unknown. Lord\r\nDreever, he had felt, was precisely the sort of youth to whom the\r\nprofessional bunco-steerer would attach himself with shouts of joy.\r\nNever, he had assured himself, had there been a softer proposition than\r\nhis lordship since bunco-steering became a profession.\r\n\r\nWhen he found that the strange visitor was Jimmy Pitt, his suspicions\r\nhad increased a thousandfold.\r\n\r\nAnd when, going to his room to get ready for dinner, he had nearly run\r\ninto Spike Mullins in the corridor, his frame of mind had been that of a\r\nman to whom a sudden ray of light reveals the fact that he is on the\r\nbrink of a black precipice. Jimmy and Spike had burgled his house\r\ntogether in New York; and here they were, together again, at Dreever\r\nCastle. To say that the thing struck McEachern as sinister is to put the\r\nmatter badly. There was once a gentleman who remarked that he smelt a\r\nrat and saw it floating in the air. Ex-Constable McEachern smelt a\r\nregiment of rats, and the air seemed to him positively congested with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse had been to rush to Jimmy’s room there and then; but\r\nhe had learned society’s lessons well. Though the heavens might fall, he\r\nmust not be late for dinner, so he went and dressed, and an obstinate\r\ntie put the finishing touches to his wrath.\r\n\r\nJimmy regarded him coolly, without moving from the chair in which he had\r\nseated himself. Spike, on the other hand, seemed embarrassed; he stood\r\nfirst on one leg and then on the other, as if he were testing the\r\nrespective merits of each and would make a definite choice later on.\r\n\r\n“You scoundrels!” growled McEachern.\r\n\r\nSpike, who had been standing for a few moments on his right leg, and\r\nseemed at last to have come to a decision, hastily changed to the left,\r\nand grinned feebly.\r\n\r\n“Say, youse won’t want me any more, boss?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“No; you can go, Spike.”\r\n\r\n“You stay where you are, you red-headed devil!” said McEachern tartly.\r\n\r\n“Run along, Spike,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThe Bowery boy looked doubtfully at the huge form of the ex-policeman,\r\nwhich blocked access to the door.\r\n\r\n“Would you mind letting my man pass?” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“You stay——” began McEachern.\r\n\r\nJimmy got up and walked round him to the door, which he opened. Spike\r\nshot out like a rabbit released from a trap. He was not lacking in\r\ncourage, but he disliked embarrassing interviews, and it struck him that\r\nJimmy was the man to handle a situation of this kind. He felt that he\r\nhimself would only be in the way.\r\n\r\n“Now we can talk comfortably,” said Jimmy, going back to his chair.\r\n\r\nMcEachern’s deep-set eyes gleamed and his forehead grew red, but he\r\nmastered his feelings.\r\n\r\n“And now——” he said.\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing at the moment.”\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean. Why are you here—you and that red-headed devil,\r\nSpike Mullins?”\r\n\r\nHe jerked his head in the direction of the door.\r\n\r\n“I am here because I was very kindly invited to come by Lord Dreever.”\r\n\r\n“I know you.”\r\n\r\n“You have that privilege. Seeing we only met once, it’s very good of you\r\nto remember me.”\r\n\r\n“What’s your game? What do you mean to do?”\r\n\r\n“To do? Well, I shall potter about the garden, you know, and shoot a\r\nbit, perhaps, and look at the horses, and think of life, and feed the\r\nchickens— I suppose there are chickens somewhere about—and possibly go\r\nfor an occasional row on the lake. Nothing more. Oh, yes, I believe they\r\nwant me to act in some theatricals.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll miss those theatricals. You’ll leave here to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow? But I’ve only just arrived, dear heart.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care about that. Out you go to-morrow. I’ll give you till\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you,” said Jimmy. “One of the oldest houses in England.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I gathered from what you said that you had bought the castle. Isn’t\r\nthat so? If it still belongs to Lord Dreever, don’t you think you ought\r\nto consult him before revising his list of guests?”\r\n\r\nMcEachern looked at him steadily. His manner became quieter.\r\n\r\n“Oh! you take that tone, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean by ‘that tone’. What tone would you take if\r\na comparative stranger ordered you to leave another man’s house?”\r\n\r\nMcEachern’s massive jaw protruded truculently in the manner which had\r\nscared good behaviour into brawling East Siders.\r\n\r\n“I know your sort,” he said. “I’ll call your bluff. And you won’t get\r\ntill to-morrow, either—it’ll be now.”\r\n\r\n“‘Why should we wait for the morrow? You are queen of my heart\r\nto-night,’” murmured Jimmy encouragingly.\r\n\r\n“I’ll expose you before them all. I’ll tell them everything.”\r\n\r\nJimmy shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Too melodramatic,” he said. “Sort of ‘I call on Heaven to judge between\r\nthis man and me’ kind of thing. I shouldn’t. What do you propose to\r\ntell, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Will you deny that you were a crook in New York?”\r\n\r\n“I will. I was nothing of the kind.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“If you’ll listen, I can explain.”\r\n\r\n“Explain!” The other’s voice rose again. “You talk about explaining, you\r\nscum, when I caught you in my own parlour at three in the morning,\r\nyou——”\r\n\r\nThe smile faded from Jimmy’s face.\r\n\r\n“Half a minute,” he said.\r\n\r\nIt might be that the ideal course would be to let the storm expend\r\nitself and then to explain quietly the whole matter of Arthur Mifflin\r\nand the bet which had led to his one excursion into burglary. But he\r\ndoubted it. Things—including his temper—had got beyond the stage of\r\nquiet explanations. McEachern would most certainly disbelieve his story.\r\nWhat would happen after that he did not know. A scene, probably—a\r\nmelodramatic denunciation, at the worst, before the other guests; at the\r\nbest, before Sir Thomas alone. He saw nothing but chaos beyond that. His\r\nstory was thin to a degree, unless backed by witnesses, and his\r\nwitnesses were three thousand miles away. Worse, he had not been alone\r\nin the policeman’s parlour. A man who is burgling a house for a bet does\r\nnot usually do it in the company of a professional burglar well known to\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\nNo; quiet explanations must be postponed. They could do no good, and\r\nwould probably lead to his spending the night and the next few nights at\r\nthe local police-station. And even if he were spared that fate, it was\r\ncertain that he would have to leave the castle.\r\n\r\nLeave the castle and Molly! He jumped up. The thought had stung him.\r\n\r\n“One moment,” he said.\r\n\r\nMcEachern stopped.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“You’re going to tell them that?” asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“Are you also going to tell them why you didn’t have me arrested that\r\nnight?” he said.\r\n\r\nMcEachern started. Jimmy planted himself in front of him and glared up\r\ninto his face. It would have been hard to say which of the two was the\r\nangrier. The policeman was flushed, and the veins stood out on his\r\nforehead. Jimmy was in a white heat of rage. He had turned very pale,\r\nand his muscles were quivering. Jimmy in this mood had once cleared a\r\nLos Angeles bar-room with the leg of a chair in the space of two and a\r\nquarter minutes by the clock.\r\n\r\n“Are you?” he demanded. “Are you?”\r\n\r\nMcEachern’s hand, hanging at his side, lifted itself hesitatingly. The\r\nfingers brushed against Jimmy’s shoulder. Jimmy’s lips twitched.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “do it! Do it, and see what happens! By God! if you put\r\na hand on me I’ll finish you. Do you think you can bully me? Do you\r\nthink I care for your size?”\r\n\r\nMcEachern dropped his hand. For the first time in his life he had met a\r\nman who, instinct told him, was his match and more. He stepped back a\r\npace.\r\n\r\nJimmy put his hands in his pockets and turned away. He walked to the\r\nmantelpiece and leaned his back against it.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t answered my question,” he said. “Perhaps you can’t!”\r\n\r\nMcEachern was wiping his forehead and breathing quickly.\r\n\r\n“If you like,” said Jimmy, “we’ll go down to the drawing-room now, and\r\nyou shall tell your story and I’ll tell mine. I wonder which they will\r\nthink the more interesting? Damn you!” he went on, his anger rising once\r\nmore, “what do you mean by it? You come into my room and bluster and\r\ntalk big about exposing crooks. What do you call yourself, I wonder? Do\r\nyou realise what you are? Why, poor Spike’s an angel compared with you!\r\nHe did take chances. He wasn’t in a position of trust. You——”\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t you better get out of here, don’t you think?” he said curtly.\r\n\r\nWithout a word McEachern walked to the door and went out.\r\n\r\nJimmy dropped into a chair with a deep breath. He took up his\r\ncigarette-case, but before he could light a match the gong sounded from\r\nthe distance.\r\n\r\nHe rose and laughed rather shakily. He felt limp. “As an effort to\r\nconciliating papa,” he said, “I’m afraid that wasn’t much of a success.”\r\n\r\nIt was not often that Mr. McEachern was visited by ideas—he ran rather\r\nto muscle than to brain—but he had one that evening during dinner. His\r\ninterview with Jimmy had left him furious, but baffled. He knew that his\r\nhands were tied. Frontal attack was useless; to drive Jimmy from the\r\ncastle would be out of the question. All that could be done was to watch\r\nhim while he was there, for he had never been more convinced of anything\r\nin his life than that Jimmy had wormed his way into the house-party with\r\nfelonious intent. The appearance of Lady Julia at dinner wearing the\r\nfamous rope of diamonds supplied an obvious motive. The necklace had an\r\ninternational reputation. Probably there was not a prominent thief in\r\nEngland or on the Continent who had not marked it down as a possible\r\nprey. It had already been tried for once. It was big game—just the sort\r\nof lure which would draw the type of criminal he imagined Jimmy to be.\r\n\r\nFrom his seat at the farther end of the table he looked at the jewels as\r\nthey gleamed on their wearer’s neck. They were almost too ostentatious\r\nfor what was, after all, an informal dinner. It was not a rope of\r\ndiamonds—it was a collar. There was something Oriental and barbaric in\r\nthe overwhelming display of jewellery. It was a prize for which a thief\r\nwould risk much.\r\n\r\nThe conversation becoming general with the fish, was not of a kind to\r\nremove from his mind the impression made by the sight of the gems. It\r\nturned on burglary. Lord Dreever began it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say,” he said. “I forgot to tell you, Aunt Julia; No. 6 was\r\nburgled the other night.”\r\n\r\nNo. 6A Eaton Square was the family’s London house.\r\n\r\n“Burgled!” said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n“Well, broken into,” said his lordship, gratified to find that he had\r\ngot the ear of his entire audience. Even Lady Julia was silent and\r\nattentive. “Chap got through the scullery window about one o’clock in\r\nthe morning.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you do?” inquired Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I—er— I was out at the time,” said Lord Dreever. “But something\r\nfrightened the feller,” he went on hurriedly, “and he made a bolt for it\r\nwithout taking anything.”\r\n\r\n“Burglary,” said a young man whom Jimmy subsequently discovered to be\r\nthe drama-loving Charteris, leaning back and taking advantage of a\r\npause, “is the hobby of the sportsman and the life-work of the\r\navaricious.”\r\n\r\nHe took a little pencil from his waistcoat pocket and made a rapid note\r\non his cuff.\r\n\r\nEverybody seemed to have something to say on the subject. One young lady\r\ngave it as her opinion that she would not like to find a burglar under\r\nher bed. Somebody also had heard of a fellow whose father had fired at\r\nthe butler under the impression that he was a house-breaker, and had\r\nbroken a valuable bust of Socrates. Lord Dreever had known a man at\r\ncollege whose brother wrote lyrics for musical comedy, and had done one\r\nabout a burglar’s best friend being his mother.\r\n\r\n“Life,” said Charteris, who had had time for reflection, “is a house\r\nwhich we all burgle. We enter it uninvited, take all that we can lay\r\nhands on, and go out again.”\r\n\r\nHe scribbled “Life—house—burgle” on his cuff and replaced the pencil.\r\n\r\n“This man’s brother I was telling you about,” said Lord Dreever, “says\r\nthere’s only one rhyme in the English language to ‘burglar,’ and that’s\r\n‘gurgler’—unless you count ‘pergola.’ He says——”\r\n\r\n“Personally,” said Jimmy, with a glance at McEachern, “I have rather a\r\nsympathy for burglars. After all, they are one of the hardest-working\r\nclasses in existence. They toil while everybody else is asleep. Besides,\r\na burglar is only a practical Socialist. People talk a lot about the\r\nredistribution of wealth. The burglar goes out and does it. I have found\r\nburglars some of the decentest criminals I have ever met.”\r\n\r\n“I despise burglars!” ejaculated Lady Julia, with a suddenness which\r\nstopped Jimmy’s eloquence as if a tap had been turned off. “If I found\r\none coming after my jewels and I had a pistol I’d shoot him.”\r\n\r\nJimmy met McEachern’s eye, and smiled kindly at him. The ex-policeman\r\nwas looking at him with the gaze of a baffled but malignant basilisk.\r\n\r\n“I take very good care no one gets a chance at your diamonds, my dear,”\r\nsaid Sir Thomas, without a blush. “I have had a steel box made for me,”\r\nhe added to the company in general, “with a special lock—a very\r\ningenious arrangement, quite unbreakable, I imagine.”\r\n\r\nJimmy, with Molly’s story fresh in his mind, could not check a rapid\r\nsmile. Mr. McEachern, watching him intently, saw it. To him it was fresh\r\nevidence, if any had been wanted, of Jimmy’s intentions, and of his\r\nconfidence of success. McEachern’s brow darkened. During the rest of the\r\nmeal tense thought rendered him more silent even than was his wont at\r\nthe dinner-table. The difficulty of his position was, he saw, great.\r\nJimmy, to be foiled, must be watched, and how could he watch him?\r\n\r\nIt was not until the coffee arrived that he found an answer to the\r\nquestion. With his first cigarette came the idea. That night, in his\r\nroom, before going to bed, he wrote a letter. It was an unusual letter,\r\nbut singularly enough, almost identical with one Sir Thomas Blunt had\r\nwritten that very morning.\r\n\r\nIt was addressed to the Manager of Dodson’s Private Inquiry Agency, of\r\nBishopsgate Street, E.C., and ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“Sir,— On receipt of this, kindly send down one of your smartest men.\r\nInstruct him to stay at the village inn in the character of American\r\nseeing sights of England and anxious to inspect Dreever Castle. I will\r\nmeet him in the village and recognise him as old New York friend, and\r\nwill then give him further instructions.— Yours faithfully, J.\r\nMcEachern.\r\n\r\n“P.S.— Kindly not send a rube, but a really smart man.”\r\n\r\nThis brief but pregnant letter cost him some pains in its composition.\r\nHe was not a ready writer, but he completed it at last to his\r\nsatisfaction. There was a crisp purity in the style which pleased him.\r\nHe sealed up the envelope and slipped it into his pocket. He felt more\r\nat ease now. Such was the friendship that had sprung up between Sir\r\nThomas Blunt and himself as the result of the jewel episode in Paris\r\nthat he could count with certainty on the successful working of his\r\nscheme. The grateful knight would not be likely to allow any old New\r\nYork friend of his preserver to languish at the village inn. The\r\nsleuth-hound would at once be installed at the castle, where,\r\nunsuspected by Jimmy, he would keep an eye on the course of events. Any\r\nlooking after that Mr. James Pitt might require might safely be left in\r\nthe hands of this expert.\r\n\r\nWith considerable fervour Mr. McEachern congratulated himself on his\r\nastuteness. With Jimmy above stairs and Spike below, the sleuth-hound\r\nwould have his hands full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 15 ★\r\n                       _Mr. McEachern Intervenes_\r\n\r\n\r\nLife at the castle during the first few days of his visit filled Jimmy\r\nwith a curious blend of emotions, mainly unpleasant. Fate, in its\r\npro-Jimmy capacity, seemed to be taking a rest. In the first place, the\r\npart allotted to him was not that of Lord Herbert, the character who\r\ntalked to Molly most of the time. The instant Charteris learned from\r\nLord Dreever that Jimmy had at one time actually been on the stage\r\nprofessionally, he decided that Lord Herbert offered too little scope\r\nfor the new man’s talents.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely no good to you, my dear chap,” he said. “It’s just a small\r\ndude part. He’s simply got to be a silly ass.”\r\n\r\nJimmy pleaded that he could be a sillier ass than anybody living; but\r\nCharteris was firm.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “You must be Captain Browne—true acting part, the biggest\r\nin the piece, full of fat lines. Spennie was to have played it, and we\r\nwere in for the worst frost in the history of the stage. Now you’ve come\r\nit’s all right. Spennie’s the ideal of Lord Herbert. He’s simply got to\r\nbe himself. We’ve got a success now, my boy. Rehearsal after lunch.\r\nDon’t be late.”\r\n\r\nAnd he had gone off to beat up the rest of the company.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment Jimmy’s troubles began. Charteris was a young man in\r\nwhom a passion for the stage was ineradicably implanted. It mattered\r\nnothing to him during these days that the sun shone, that it was\r\npleasant on the lake, and that Jimmy would have given five pounds a\r\nminute to be allowed to get Molly to himself for half an hour every\r\nafternoon. All he knew or cared about was that the local nobility and\r\ngentry were due to arrive at the castle a week from that day, and that\r\nvery few of the company even knew their lines. Having hustled Jimmy into\r\nthe part of Captain Browne, he gave his energy free play. He conducted\r\nrehearsals with a vigour which occasionally almost welded the rabble he\r\nwas coaching into something approaching coherency. He painted scenery\r\nand left it about—wet—and people sat on it; he nailed up horseshoes for\r\nluck, and they fell on people. But nothing daunted him; he never rested.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Charteris,” said Lady Julia rather frigidly, after one energetic\r\nrehearsal, “is indefatigable. He whirled me about!”\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, his greatest triumph, properly considered, that he had\r\ninduced Lady Julia to take a part in his piece; but to the born\r\norganiser of amateur theatricals no miracle of this kind is impossible,\r\nand Charteris was one of the most inveterate organisers in the country.\r\nThere had been some talk—late at night in the billiard-room—of his being\r\nabout to write in a comic footman _role_ for Sir Thomas, but it had\r\nfallen through; not, it was felt, because Charteris could not have\r\nhypnotised him into undertaking it, but rather because Sir Thomas was\r\nhistrionically unfit.\r\n\r\nMainly as a result of the producer’s energy Jimmy found himself one of a\r\ncrowd, and disliked the sensation. He had not experienced much\r\ndifficulty in mastering the scenes in which he appeared; but\r\nunfortunately those who appeared with him had. It occurred to Jimmy\r\ndaily, after he had finished “running through the lines” with a series\r\nof agitated amateurs, male and female, that for all practical purposes\r\nhe might just as well have gone to Japan. In this confused welter of\r\nrehearsers his opportunities of talking with Molly were infinitesimal.\r\nAnd worse, she did not appear to mind. She was cheerful, and apparently\r\nquite content to be engulfed in a crowd. Probably, he thought with some\r\nmelancholy, if she met his eye, and noted in it a distracted gleam, she\r\nput it down to the same cause which made other eyes in the company gleam\r\ndistractedly during that week.\r\n\r\nJimmy began to take a thoroughly jaundiced view of amateur theatricals,\r\nand of these amateur theatricals in particular. He felt that in the\r\nelectric flame department of the infernal regions there should be a\r\nspecial gridiron, reserved exclusively for the man who invented these\r\nperformances, so diametrically opposed to the true spirit of\r\ncivilisation. At the close of each day he cursed Charteris with\r\nunfailing regularity.\r\n\r\nThere was another thing that disturbed him. That he should be unable to\r\ntalk with Molly was an evil, but a negative evil. It was supplemented by\r\none that was positive. Even in the midst of the chaos of rehearsals he\r\ncould not help noticing that Molly and Lord Dreever were very much\r\ntogether. Also—and this was even more sinister—he observed that both Sir\r\nThomas Blunt and Mr. McEachern were making determined efforts to foster\r\nthis state of affairs.\r\n\r\nOf this he had sufficient proof one evening when, after scheming and\r\nplotting in a way that had made the great efforts of Machiavelli and\r\nRichelieu seem like the work of raw novices, he had cut Molly out from\r\nthe throng and carried her off for the alleged purpose of helping him\r\nfeed the chickens. There were, as he had suspected, chickens attached to\r\nthe castle. They lived in a little world of noise and smells at the back\r\nof the stables. Bearing an iron pot full of a poisonous-looking mash,\r\nand accompanied by Molly, he had felt, for perhaps a minute and a half,\r\nlike a successful general. It is difficult to be romantic when you are\r\nladen with chicken-feed in an unwieldy iron pot, but he had resolved\r\nthat that portion of the proceedings should be brief—the birds should\r\ndine that evening on the quick-lunch principle—then to the more fitting\r\nsurroundings of the rose-garden. There was plenty of time before the\r\nhour of the sounding of the dressing-gong. Perhaps even a row on the\r\nlake——\r\n\r\n“What-ho!” said a voice.\r\n\r\nBehind them, with a propitiatory smile on his face, stood his lordship\r\nof Dreever.\r\n\r\n“My uncle told me I should find you out here. What have you got there,\r\nPitt? Is this what you feed them on? I say, you know, queer coves, hens!\r\nI wouldn’t touch the stuff for a fortune. What? Looks to me poisonous.”\r\n\r\nHe met Jimmy’s eye and stopped. There was that in Jimmy’s eye that would\r\nhave stopped an avalanche. His lordship twiddled his fingers in pink\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n“Oh, look!” said Molly. “There’s a poor little chicken out there in the\r\ncold. It hasn’t had a morsel. Give me the spoon, Mr. Pitt. Here, chick,\r\nchick! Don’t be silly, I’m not going to hurt you. I’ve brought you your\r\ndinner.”\r\n\r\nShe moved off in pursuit of the solitary fowl, which had edged nervously\r\naway. Lord Dreever bent towards Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Frightfully sorry, Pitt, old man,” he whispered feverishly. “Didn’t\r\nwant to come. Couldn’t help it. He sent me out.” He half looked over his\r\nshoulder. “And,” he added rapidly, as Molly came back, “the old boy’s at\r\nhis bedroom window now, watching us through his opera-glasses!”\r\n\r\nThe return journey to the house was performed in silence—on Jimmy’s part\r\nin thoughtful silence. He thought hard, and had been thinking ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nHe had material for thought. That Lord Dreever was as clay in his\r\nuncle’s hands he was aware. He had not known his lordship long, but he\r\nhad known him long enough to realise that a backbone had been carelessly\r\nomitted from his composition. What his uncle directed that would he do.\r\nThe situation looked bad to Jimmy. The order, he knew, had gone out that\r\nLord Dreever was to marry money, and Molly was an heiress. He did not\r\nknow how much Mr. McEachern had amassed in his dealings with New York\r\ncrime, but it could not but be something considerable. Things looked\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThen he had a reaction. He was taking too much for granted. Lord Dreever\r\nmight be hounded into proposing to Molly, but what earthly reason was\r\nthere for supposing that Molly would accept him? He declined even for an\r\ninstant to look upon Spennie’s title in the light of a lure. Molly was\r\nnot the girl to marry for a title. He endeavoured to examine impartially\r\nhis lordship’s other claims. He was a pleasant fellow, with—to judge on\r\nshort acquaintanceship—an undeniably amiable disposition. That much must\r\nbe conceded. But against this must be placed the equally undeniable fact\r\nthat he was also, as he would have put it himself, a most frightful ass.\r\nHe was weak. He had no character. Altogether, the examination made Jimmy\r\nmore cheerful. He could not see the light-haired one, even with Sir\r\nThomas Blunt shoving behind, as it were, accomplishing the knight’s\r\nends. Shove he never so wisely, Sir Thomas could never make a Romeo out\r\nof Spennie Dreever.\r\n\r\nIt was while sitting in the billiard-room one night after dinner,\r\nwatching his rival play a hundred up with the silent Hargate, that Jimmy\r\ncame definitely to this conclusion. He had stopped to watch more because\r\nhe wished to study his man at close range than because the game was\r\nanything out of the common as an exposition of billiards. As a matter of\r\nfact, it would have been hard to imagine a worse game. Lord Dreever, who\r\nwas conceding twenty, was poor, and his opponent an obvious beginner.\r\nAgain, as he looked on, Jimmy was possessed of an idea that he had met\r\nHargate before. But once more he searched his memory and drew blank. He\r\ndid not give the thing much thought, being intent on his diagnosis of\r\nLord Dreever, who, by a fluky series of cannons, had wobbled into the\r\nforties, and was now a few points ahead of his opponent.\r\n\r\nPresently, having summed his lordship up to his satisfaction, and grown\r\nbored with the game, Jimmy strolled out of the room. He paused outside\r\nthe door for a moment, wondering what to do. There was bridge in the\r\nsmoking-room, but he did not feel inclined for bridge. From the\r\ndrawing-room there came sounds of music. He turned in that direction,\r\nthen stopped again. He came to the conclusion that he did not feel\r\nsociable. He wanted to think. A cigar on the terrace would meet his\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nHe went up to his room for his cigar-case. The window was open. He\r\nleaned out. There was almost a full moon, and it was very light out of\r\ndoors. His eye was caught by a movement at the farther end of the\r\nterrace, where the shadow was. A girl came out of the shadow, walking\r\nslowly....\r\n\r\nNot since early boyhood had Jimmy descended stairs with such a rare\r\nburst of speed. He negotiated the nasty turn at the end of the first\r\nflight at quite a suicidal pace. Fate, however, had apparently wakened\r\nup again and resumed business, for he did not break his neck. A few\r\nmoments later he was out on the terrace, bearing a cloak which he had\r\nsnatched up _en route_ in the hall.\r\n\r\n“I thought you might be cold,” he said, breathing quickly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you,” said Molly. “How kind of you!” He put it round her\r\nshoulders. “Have you been running?”\r\n\r\n“I came downstairs rather fast.”\r\n\r\n“Were you afraid the boogaboos would get you?” she laughed. “I was\r\nthinking of when I was a small child. I was always afraid of them. I\r\nused to race downstairs when I had to go to my room in the dark, unless\r\nI could persuade some one to hold my hand all the way there and back.”\r\n\r\nHer spirits had risen with Jimmy’s arrival. Things had been happening\r\nthat worried her. She had gone out onto the terrace to be alone. When\r\nshe heard his footsteps she had dreaded the advent of some garrulous\r\nfellow-guest, full of small talk. Jimmy, somehow, was a comfort—he did\r\nnot disturb the atmosphere. Little as they had seen of each other,\r\nsomething in him—she could not say what—had drawn her to him. He was a\r\nman, she felt instinctively, she could trust.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence. Words were pouring into Jimmy’s mind, but he\r\ncould not frame them. He seemed to have lost the power of coherent\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nMolly said nothing. It was not a night for conversation. The moon had\r\nturned terrace and garden into a fairyland of black and silver. It was a\r\nnight to look and listen and think.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly up and down. As they turned for the second time\r\nMolly’s thoughts formed themselves into a question. Twice she was on the\r\npoint of asking it, but each time she checked herself. It was an\r\nimpossible question. She had no right to put it, and he had no right to\r\nanswer. Yet something was driving her on to ask it.\r\n\r\nIt came out suddenly, without warning.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Pitt, what do you think of Lord Dreever?”\r\n\r\nJimmy started. No question could have chimed in more aptly with his\r\nthoughts. Even as she spoke he was struggling to keep himself from\r\nasking her the same thing.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know I ought not to ask,” she went on. “He’s your host and you’re\r\nhis friend, I know. But——”\r\n\r\nHer voice trailed off. The muscles of Jimmy’s back tightened and\r\nquivered, but he could find no words.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t ask any one else. But you’re—different somehow. I don’t know\r\nwhat I mean—we hardly know each other—but——”\r\n\r\nShe stopped again, and still he was dumb.\r\n\r\n“I feel so alone,” she said very quietly, almost to herself. Something\r\nseemed to break in Jimmy’s head. His brain suddenly cleared. He took a\r\nstep forward.\r\n\r\nA huge shadow blackened the white grass. Jimmy wheeled round. It was\r\nMcEachern.\r\n\r\n“I have been looking for you, Molly, my dear. I thought you must have\r\ngone to bed.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Jimmy and addressed him for the first time since their\r\nmeeting in the bedroom.\r\n\r\n“Will you excuse us, Mr. Pitt?”\r\n\r\nJimmy bowed and walked rapidly towards the house. At the door he stopped\r\nand looked back. The two were standing where he had left them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 16 ★\r\n                     _A Marriage has been Arranged_\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither Molly nor her father had moved or spoken while Jimmy was\r\ncovering the short strip of turf that ended at the stone steps of the\r\nhouse. McEachern stood looking down at her in grim silence. His great\r\nbody against the dark mass of the castle wall seemed larger than ever in\r\nthe uncertain light. To Molly there was something sinister and menacing\r\nin his attitude. She found herself longing that Jimmy would come back.\r\nShe was frightened. Why, she could not have said. It was as if some\r\ninstinct told her that a crisis in her affairs had been reached, and\r\nthat she needed him. For the first time in her life she felt nervous in\r\nher father’s company. Ever since she was a child she had been accustomed\r\nto look upon him as her protector, but now she was afraid.\r\n\r\n“Father!” she cried.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing out here?”\r\n\r\nHis voice was tense and strained.\r\n\r\n“I came out because I wanted to think, father dear.”\r\n\r\nShe thought she knew his moods, but this was one that she had never\r\nseen. It frightened her.\r\n\r\n“Why did he come out here?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Pitt? He brought me a wrap.”\r\n\r\n“What was he saying to you?”\r\n\r\nThe rain of questions gave Molly a sensation of being battered. She felt\r\ndazed and a little mutinous. What had she done that she should be\r\nassailed like this?\r\n\r\n“He was saying nothing,” she said, rather shortly.\r\n\r\n“Nothing! What do you mean? What was he saying? Tell me!”\r\n\r\nMolly’s voice shook as she replied.\r\n\r\n“He was saying nothing,” she repeated. “Do you think I’m not telling you\r\nthe truth, father? He had not spoken a word for ever so long. We just\r\nwalked up and down. I was thinking, and I suppose he was, too. At any\r\nrate, he said nothing. I—I think you might believe me.”\r\n\r\nShe began to cry quietly. Her father had never been like this before. It\r\nhurt her.\r\n\r\nMcEachern’s manner changed in a flash. In the shock of finding Jimmy and\r\nMolly together on the terrace he had forgotten himself. He had had\r\nreason to be suspicious. Sir Thomas Blunt, from whom he had just parted,\r\nhad told him a certain piece of news which had disturbed him. The\r\ndiscovery of Jimmy with Molly had lent an added significance to that\r\npiece of news. He saw that he had been rough. In a moment he was by her\r\nside, his great arm round her shoulder, petting and comforting her as he\r\nhad done when she was a child. He believed her word without question,\r\nand his relief made him very tender. Gradually the sobs ceased. She\r\nleaned against his arm.\r\n\r\n“I’m tired, father,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“Poor little girl. We’ll sit down.”\r\n\r\nThere was a seat at the end of the terrace. He picked her up as if she\r\nhad been a baby and carried her to it. She gave a little cry.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean I was too tired to walk,” she said, laughing tremulously.\r\n“How strong you are, father! If I were naughty you could take me up and\r\nshake me till I was good, couldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course; and send you to bed, too, so you be careful, young woman.”\r\n\r\nHe lowered her to the seat. Molly drew the cloak closer round her and\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\n“Cold, dear?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You shivered.”\r\n\r\n“It was nothing; yes, it was,” she went on quickly.\r\n\r\n“It was. Father, will you promise me something?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. What?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t ever, ever be angry with me like that again, will you? I couldn’t\r\nbear it—really I couldn’t. I know it’s stupid of me, but it hurt. You\r\ndon’t know how it hurt.”\r\n\r\n“But my dear——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know it’s stupid. But——”\r\n\r\n“But, my darling, it wasn’t so. I was angry, but it wasn’t with you.”\r\n\r\n“With——. Were you angry with Mr. Pitt?”\r\n\r\nMcEachern saw that he had travelled too far. He had intended that\r\nJimmy’s existence should be forgotten for the time being—he had other\r\nthings to discuss; but it was too late now. He must go forward.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t like to see you out here alone with Mr. Pitt, dear,” he said.\r\n“I was afraid——”\r\n\r\nHe saw that he must go still farther forward. It was more than awkward.\r\nHe wished to hint at the undesirability of an entanglement with Jimmy\r\nwithout admitting the possibility of it. Not being a man of nimble\r\nbrain, he found this somewhat beyond his powers.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like him,” he said briefly. “He’s crooked.”\r\n\r\nMolly’s eyes opened wide. The colour had gone from her face.\r\n\r\n“Crooked, father?”\r\n\r\nMcEachern perceived that he had travelled very much too far, almost to\r\ndisaster. He longed to denounce Jimmy, but he was gagged. If Molly were\r\nto ask the question that Jimmy had asked in the bedroom—that fatal,\r\nunanswerable question! The price was too great to pay.\r\n\r\nHe spoke cautiously, vaguely, feeling his way.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t explain to you, my dear—you wouldn’t understand. You must\r\nremember, my dear, that out in New York I was in a position to know a\r\ngreat many queer characters—crooks, Molly. I was working among them.”\r\n\r\n“But, father, that night at our house you didn’t know Mr. Pitt. He had\r\nto tell you his name.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know him—then,” said her father slowly; “but—but——” He paused.\r\n“But I made inquiries,” he concluded, with a rush, “and found out\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nHe permitted himself a long, silent breath of relief. He saw his way\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n“Inquiries?” said Molly. “Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why did you suspect him?”\r\n\r\nA moment earlier the question might have confused McEachern, but not\r\nnow. He was equal to it. He took it in his stride.\r\n\r\n“It’s hard to say, my dear. A man who has had as much to do with crooks\r\nas I have recognises them when he sees them.”\r\n\r\n“Did you think Mr. Pitt looked—looked like that?” Her voice was very\r\nsmall. There was a drawn pinched expression on her face. She was paler\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nHe could not divine her thoughts. He could not know what his words had\r\ndone—how they had shown her in a flash what Jimmy was to her, and lit up\r\nher mind like a flame, revealing the secret hidden there. She knew now.\r\nThe feeling of comradeship, the instinctive trust, the sense of\r\ndependence—they no longer perplexed her. They were signs which she could\r\nread.\r\n\r\nAnd he was crooked!\r\n\r\nMcEachern proceeded. Relief made him buoyant.\r\n\r\n“I did, my dear. I can read him like a book. I’ve met scores of his\r\nsort. Broadway is full of them. Good clothes and a pleasant manner don’t\r\nmake an honest man. I’ve run up against a mighty high-toned bunch of\r\ncrooks in my day. It’s a long time since I gave up thinking that it was\r\nonly the ones with the low foreheads and the thick ears that needed\r\nwatching. It’s the innocent Willies who look as if all they could do was\r\nto lead the cotillon. This man Pitt’s one of them. I’m not guessing,\r\nmind you—I know. I know his line, and all about him. I’m watching him.\r\nHe’s here on some game. How did he get here? Why, he scraped\r\nacquaintance with Lord Dreever in a London restaurant. It’s the\r\ncommonest trick on the list. If I hadn’t happened to be here when he\r\ncame I suppose he’d have made his haul by now. Why, he came all prepared\r\nfor it! Have you seen an ugly, grinning, red-headed scoundrel hanging\r\nabout the place? His valet, so he says. Valet! Do you know who that is?\r\nThat’s one of the most notorious Yegg-men on the other side. There isn’t\r\na policeman in New York who doesn’t know Spike Mullins. Even if I knew\r\nnothing of this Pitt that would be enough. What’s an innocent man going\r\nround the country with Spike Mullins for, unless they are standing in\r\ntogether at some game? That’s who Mr. Pitt is, my dear, and that’s why,\r\nmaybe, I seemed a little put out when I came upon you and him out here\r\nalone together. See as little of him as you can. In a large party like\r\nthis it won’t be difficult to avoid him.”\r\n\r\nMolly sat staring out across the garden. At first every word had been a\r\nstab. Several times she had been on the point of crying out that she\r\ncould bear it no longer, but gradually a numbness succeeded the pain.\r\nShe found herself listening apathetically.\r\n\r\nMcEachern talked on. He left the subject of Jimmy, comfortably conscious\r\nthat, even if there had ever existed in Molly’s heart any budding\r\nfeeling of the kind he had suspected, it must now be dead. He steered\r\nthe conversation away until it ran easily among commonplaces. He talked\r\nof New York, of the preparations for the theatricals. Molly answered\r\ncomposedly. She was still pale, and a certain listlessness in her manner\r\nmight have been noticed by a more observant man than Mr. McEachern.\r\nBeyond that there was nothing to show that her heart had been born and\r\nkilled but a few minutes before. Women have the Red Indian instinct; and\r\nMolly had grown to womanhood in those few minutes.\r\n\r\nPresently Lord Dreever’s name came up.\r\n\r\nIt caused a momentary pause, and McEachern took advantage of it. It was\r\nthe cue for which he had been waiting.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for a moment, for the conversation was about to enter upon\r\na difficult phase, and he was not quite sure of himself.\r\n\r\nThen he took the plunge.\r\n\r\n“I have just been talking to Sir Thomas, my dear,” he said. He tried to\r\nspeak casually, and as a natural result infused so much meaning into his\r\nvoice that Molly looked at him in surprise. McEachern coughed\r\nconfusedly. Diplomacy, he concluded, was not his forte. He abandoned it\r\nin favour of directness.\r\n\r\n“He was telling me that you had refused Lord Dreever this evening.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did,” said Molly. “How did Sir Thomas know?”\r\n\r\n“Lord Dreever told him.”\r\n\r\nMolly raised her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t have thought it was the sort of thing he would talk about,”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n“Sir Thomas is his uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. So he is,” said Molly dryly. “I forgot. That would account\r\nfor it, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern looked at her with some concern. There was a hard ring in\r\nher voice which he did not altogether like. His greatest admirer had\r\nnever called him an intuitive man, and he was quite at a loss to see\r\nwhat was wrong. As a schemer he was perhaps, a little naive. He had\r\ntaken it for granted that Molly was ignorant of the manoeuvres which had\r\nbeen going on, and which had culminated that afternoon in a stammering\r\nproposal of marriage from Lord Dreever in the rose-garden. This,\r\nhowever, was not the case. The woman incapable of seeing through the\r\nmachinations of two men of the mental calibre of Sir Thomas Blunt and\r\nMr. McEachern has yet to be born. For some considerable time Molly had\r\nbeen alive to the well-meant plottings of that worthy pair, and had\r\nderived little pleasure from the fact. It may be that woman loves to be\r\npursued, but she does not love to be pursued by a crowd.\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern cleared his throat and began again.\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t decide a question like that too hastily, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t—not too hastily for Lord Dreever, at any rate, poor dear.”\r\n\r\n“It was in your power,” said Mr. McEachern portentously, “to make a man\r\nhappy.”\r\n\r\n“I did,” said Molly, bitterly. “You should have seen his face light up.\r\nHe could hardly believe it was true for a moment, and then it came home\r\nto him, and I thought he would have fallen on my neck. He did his very\r\nbest to look heartbroken—out of politeness—but it was no good. He\r\nwhistled most of the way back to the house—all flat, but very\r\ncheerfully.”\r\n\r\n“My dear! What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nMolly had made the discovery earlier in their conversation that her\r\nfather had moods whose existence she had not suspected. It was his turn\r\nnow to make a similar discovery regarding herself.\r\n\r\n“I mean nothing, father,” she said. “I’m just telling you what happened.\r\nHe came to me looking like a dog that’s going to be washed——”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course; he was nervous, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. He couldn’t know that I was going to refuse him.”\r\n\r\nShe was breathing quickly. He started to speak, but she went on looking\r\nstraight before her. Her face was very white in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n“He took me into the rose-garden. Was that Sir Thomas’s idea? There\r\ncouldn’t have been a better setting, I’m sure—the roses looked lovely.\r\nPresently I heard him gulp, and I was so sorry for him. I would have\r\nrefused him then, and put him out of his misery, only I couldn’t very\r\nwell till he had proposed, could I? So I turned my back and sniffed at a\r\nrose, and then he shut his eyes—I couldn’t see him, but I knew he shut\r\nhis eyes—and began to say his lesson.”\r\n\r\n“Molly!”\r\n\r\n“He did—he said his lesson. He gabbled it. When he had got as far as\r\n‘Well don’t you know, what I mean is, that’s what I wanted to say, you\r\nknow,’ I turned round and soothed him. I said, I didn’t love him. He\r\nsaid, ‘No, no, of course not.’ I said he had paid me a great compliment.\r\nHe said, ‘Not at all,’ looking very anxious, poor darling, as if even\r\nthen he was afraid of what might come next. But I reassured him, and he\r\ncheered up, and we walked back to the house together, as happy as could\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\nMcEachern put his hand round her shoulder. She winced, but let it stay.\r\nHe attempted gruff conciliation.\r\n\r\n“My dear, you’ve been imagining things. Of course he isn’t happy. Why, I\r\nsaw the young fellow——”\r\n\r\nRecollecting that the last time he had seen the young fellow—shortly\r\nafter dinner—the young fellow had been occupied in juggling, with every\r\nappearance of mental peace, with two billiard-balls and a box of\r\nmatches, he broke off abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Father?”\r\n\r\n“My dear?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you want me to marry Lord Dreever?”\r\n\r\n“I think he’s a fine young fellow,” he said, avoiding her eyes.\r\n\r\n“He’s quite nice,” said Molly quietly.\r\n\r\nMcEachern had been trying not to say it. He did not wish to say it. If\r\nit could have been hinted at, he would have done it, but he was not good\r\nat hinting. A lifetime passed in surroundings where the subtlest hint is\r\na drive in the ribs with a truncheon does not leave a man an adept at\r\nthe art. He had to be blunt or silent.\r\n\r\n“He’s the Earl of Dreever, my dear.”\r\n\r\nHe rushed on, desperately anxious to cover the nakedness of the\r\nstatement in a comfortable garment of words.\r\n\r\n“Why, you see, you’re young, Molly. It’s only natural you shouldn’t look\r\non these things sensibly. You expect too much of a man. You expect this\r\nyoung fellow to be like the heroes of the novels you read. When you’ve\r\nlived a little longer, my dear, you’ll see that there’s nothing in it.\r\nIt isn’t the hero of the novel you want to marry, it’s the man who’ll\r\nmake you a good husband.”\r\n\r\nThis remark struck Mr. McEachern as so pithy and profound that he\r\nrepeated it.\r\n\r\nHe went on. Molly was sitting quite still, looking into the shrubbery.\r\nHe assumed she was listening, but whether she was or not he must go on\r\ntalking. The situation was difficult. Silence would make it more so.\r\n\r\n“Now, look at Lord Dreever,” he said. “There’s a young man with one of\r\nthe oldest titles in England. He could go anywhere and do what he liked,\r\nand be excused for whatever he did because of his name; but he doesn’t.\r\nHe’s got the right stuff in him. He doesn’t go racketing around——”\r\n\r\n“His uncle doesn’t allow him enough pocket-money,” said Molly, with a\r\njarring little laugh. “Perhaps that’s why.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. McEachern required a few moments in which to marshal\r\nhis arguments once more. He had been thrown out of his stride.\r\n\r\n“Father dear, listen,” she said. “We always used to understand each\r\nother so well.” He patted her shoulder affectionately. “You can’t mean\r\nwhat you say. You know I don’t love Lord Dreever, you know he’s only a\r\nboy. Don’t you want me to marry a man? I love this old place; but surely\r\nyou can’t think that it can really matter in a thing like this? You\r\ndon’t really mean that about the hero of the novel? I’m not stupid, like\r\nthat. I only want—oh, I can’t put it into words; but don’t you see?”\r\n\r\nHer eyes were fixed appealingly on him. It only needed a word from\r\nhim—perhaps not even a word—to close the gulf which had opened between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe missed the chance. He had had time to think, and his arguments were\r\nready again. With stolid good humour he marched along the line he had\r\nmapped out. He was kindly and shrewd and practical, and the gulf gaped\r\nwider with every word.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t be rash, my dear—you mustn’t act without thinking in these\r\nthings. Lord Dreever is only a boy, as you say, but he will grow. You\r\nsay you don’t love him. Nonsense! You like him, you would go on liking\r\nhim more and more. And why? Because you could make what you pleased of\r\nhim. You’ve got character, my dear. With a girl like you to look after\r\nhim, he would go a long way, a very long way. It’s all there; it only\r\nwants bringing out. And think of it, Molly—Countess of Dreever! There’s\r\nhardly a better title in England. It would make me very happy, my dear.\r\nIt’s been my one hope all these years to see you in the place where you\r\nought to be. And now the chance has come. Molly dear, don’t throw it\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nShe had leaned back with closed eyes. A wave of exhaustion had swept\r\nover her. She listened in a dull dream. She felt beaten. They were too\r\nstrong for her. There were too many of them. What did it matter? Why not\r\ngive in and end it all and win peace? That was all she wanted—peace now.\r\nWhat did it all matter?\r\n\r\n“Very well, father,” she said listlessly.\r\n\r\nMcEachern stopped short.\r\n\r\n“You’ll do it, dear?” he cried. “You will?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, father.”\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her.\r\n\r\n“My own dear little girl,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe got up.\r\n\r\n“I’m rather tired, father,” she said. “I think I’ll go in.”\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Mr. McEachern was in Sir Thomas Blunt’s study. Five\r\nminutes later Sir Thomas pressed the bell.\r\n\r\nSaunders appeared.\r\n\r\n“Tell his lordship,” said Sir Thomas, “that I wish to see him for a\r\nmoment. He is in the billiard-room, I think.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 17 ★\r\n         _Jimmy Remembers Something, and Hears Something Else_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game between Hargate and Lord Dreever was still in progress when\r\nJimmy returned to the billiard-room. A glance at the board showed that\r\nthe score was seventy—sixty-nine in favour of spot.\r\n\r\n“Good game,” said Jimmy. “Who’s spot?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” said his lordship, missing an easy cannon. For some reason he\r\nappeared in high spirits. “Hargate’s been going great guns. I was eleven\r\nahead a moment ago, but he made a break of twelve.”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever belonged to the class of billiard-player to whom a\r\ndouble-figure break is a thing to be noted and greeted with respect.\r\n\r\n“Fluky,” muttered the silent Hargate deprecatingly. This was a long\r\nspeech for him. Since their meeting at Paddington Station Jimmy had\r\nseldom heard him utter anything beyond a monosyllable.\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it, dear old son,” said Lord Dreever handsomely. “You’re\r\ncoming on like a two-year-old. I shan’t be able to give you twenty in a\r\nhundred much longer.”\r\n\r\nHe went to a side-table and mixed himself a whisky and soda, singing a\r\nbrief extract from musical comedy as he did so. There could be no shadow\r\nof doubt that he was finding life good. For the past few days, and\r\nparticularly that afternoon, he had been rather noticeably ill at ease.\r\nJimmy had seen him hanging about the terrace at half-past five, and had\r\nthought that he looked like a mute at a funeral, but now, only a few\r\nhours later, he was beaming on the world and chirping like a bird.\r\n\r\nThe game moved jerkily along. Jimmy took a seat and watched. The score\r\nmounted slowly. Lord Dreever was bad, but Hargate was worse. At length,\r\nin the eighties, his lordship struck a brilliant vein. When he had\r\nfinished his break his score was ninety-five. Hargate, who had profited\r\nby a series of misses on his opponent’s part, had reached ninety-six.\r\n\r\n“This is shortening my life,” said Jimmy, leaning forward.\r\n\r\nThe balls had been left in an ideal position. Even Hargate could not\r\nfail to make a cannon. He made it.\r\n\r\nA close finish to even the worst game is exciting. Jimmy leaned still\r\nfarther forward to watch the next stroke. It looked as if Hargate would\r\nhave to wait for his victory. A good player could have made a cannon as\r\nthe balls lay, but not Hargate. They were almost in a straight line,\r\nwith white in the centre.\r\n\r\nHargate swore under his breath. There was nothing to be done. He struck\r\ncarelessly at white. White rolled against red, seemed to hang for a\r\nmoment, and shot straight back against spot. The game was over.\r\n\r\n“Great Scot! What a fluke!” cried the silent one, becoming quite\r\ngarrulous at the miracle.\r\n\r\nA quiet grin spread itself slowly across Jimmy’s face. He had remembered\r\nwhat he had been trying to remember for over a week.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened and Saunders appeared. “Sir Thomas would\r\nlike to see your lordship in his study,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Eh? What does he want?”\r\n\r\n“Sir Thomas did not confide in me, your lordship.”\r\n\r\n“Eh? What? Oh, no. Well, see you later, you men.”\r\n\r\nHe rested his cue against the table and put on his coat. Jimmy followed\r\nhim out of the door, which he shut behind him.\r\n\r\n“One second, Dreever,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Eh? Halloa! What’s up?”\r\n\r\n“Any money on that game?” asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes; by Jove! now you mention it, there was—an even fiver.\r\nAnd—er—by the way, old man, the fact is, just for the moment, I’m\r\nfrightfully——. You haven’t such a thing as a fiver anywhere about, have\r\nyou? The fact is——”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, of course. I’ll square up with him now, shall I?”\r\n\r\n“Fearfully obliged if you would. Thanks, old man. Pay it you to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“No hurry,” said Jimmy; “plenty more in the old oak chest.”\r\n\r\nHe went back to the room. Hargate was practising cannons. He was on the\r\npoint of making a stroke when Jimmy opened the door.\r\n\r\n“Care for a game?” said Hargate.\r\n\r\n“Not just at present,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nHargate attempted his cannon and failed badly. Jimmy smiled.\r\n\r\n“Not such a good shot as the last,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Fine shot, that other.”\r\n\r\n“Fluke.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder.”\r\n\r\nJimmy lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“Do you know New York at all?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Been there.”\r\n\r\n“Ever been in the Strollers’ Club?”\r\n\r\nHargate turned his back; but Jimmy had seen his face and was satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Don’t know it,” said Hargate.\r\n\r\n“Great place,” said Jimmy. “Mostly actors and writers, and so on. The\r\nonly drawback is that some pick up queer friends.”\r\n\r\nHargate did not reply. He did not seem interested.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” went on Jimmy. “For instance, a pal of mine—an actor named\r\nMifflin—introduced a man a year ago as a member’s guest for a fortnight,\r\nand this man rooked the fellows of I don’t know how much at billiards.\r\nThe old game, you know—nursing his man right up to the end, and then\r\nfinishing with a burst. Of course, when that happens once or twice it\r\nmay be an accident, but when a man who poses as a novice always manages\r\nby a really brilliant shot——”\r\n\r\nHargate turned round.\r\n\r\n“They fired this fellow out,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Look here!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a dull yarn,” said Jimmy apologetically. “I’ve been boring you. By\r\nthe way, Dreever asked me to square up with you for that game, in case\r\nhe shouldn’t be back. Here you are.”\r\n\r\nHe held out an empty hand.\r\n\r\n“Got it?”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?” demanded Hargate.\r\n\r\n“What am I going to do?” queried Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean. If you’ll keep your mouth shut, and stand in,\r\nit’s halves. Is that what you’re after?”\r\n\r\nJimmy was delighted. He knew that by rights the proposal should have\r\nbrought him from his seat, with stern, set face, to wreak vengeance for\r\nthe insult, but on such occasions he was apt to ignore the conventions.\r\nHis impulse, when he met a man whose code of behaviour was not the\r\nordinary code, was to chat with him and to extract his point of view. He\r\nfelt as little animus against Hargate as he had felt against Spike on\r\nthe occasion of their first meeting.\r\n\r\n“Do you make much at this sort of game?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHargate was relieved. This was business-like.\r\n\r\n“Pots,” he said, with some enthusiasm—“pots I tell you, if you’ll stand\r\nin——”\r\n\r\n“Bit risky, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it. An occasional accident——”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’d call me one?”\r\n\r\nHargate grinned.\r\n\r\n“It must be pretty tough work,” said Jimmy. “You must have to use a\r\ntremendous lot of self-restraint.”\r\n\r\nHargate sighed.\r\n\r\n“That’s the worst of it,” he said—“the having to seem a mug at the game.\r\nI’ve been patronised sometimes by young fools who thought they were\r\nteaching me till I nearly forgot myself and showed them what real\r\nbilliards was.”\r\n\r\n“There’s always some drawback to the learned professions,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“But there’s a heap to make up for it in this one,” said Hargate. “Well,\r\nlook here; is it a deal? You stand in——”\r\n\r\nJimmy shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I guess not,” he said. “It’s good of you, but commercial speculation\r\nnever was in my line. I’m afraid you must count me out of this.”\r\n\r\n“What! You’re going to tell——”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jimmy, “I’m not. I’m not a vigilance committee. I won’t tell\r\na soul.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then——” began Hargate, relieved.\r\n\r\n“Unless, of course,” Jimmy went on, “you play billiards again while\r\nyou’re here.”\r\n\r\n“But, damn it, man! if I don’t, what’s the good? Look here, what am I to\r\ndo if they ask me to play?”\r\n\r\n“Give your wrist as an excuse.”\r\n\r\n“My wrist?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You sprained it to-morrow after breakfast. It was bad luck. I\r\nwonder how you came to do it? You didn’t sprain it much, but just enough\r\nto stop you playing billiards.”\r\n\r\nHargate reflected.\r\n\r\n“Understand?” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well,” said Hargate sullenly. “But,” he burst out, “if I ever\r\nget a chance to get even with you——”\r\n\r\n“You won’t,” said Jimmy. “Dismiss the rosy dream. Get even! You don’t\r\nknow me! There’s not a flaw in my armour. I’m a sort of modern edition\r\nof the Stainless Knight. Tennyson drew Galahad from me. I move through\r\nlife with almost a sickening absence of sin. But hush! We are\r\nobserved—at least, we shall be in another minute—somebody is coming down\r\nthe passage. You do understand, don’t you? Sprained wrist is the\r\nwatchword.”\r\n\r\nThe handle turned. It was Lord Dreever, back again from his interview.\r\n\r\n“Halloa, Dreever!” said Jimmy. “We’ve missed you. Hargate has been doing\r\nhis best to amuse me with acrobatic tricks. But you’re too reckless,\r\nHargate, old man. Mark my words, one of these days you’ll be spraining\r\nyour wrist. You should be more careful. What, going? Good night.\r\nPleasant fellow, Hargate,” he added, as the footsteps retreated down the\r\npassage. “Well, my lad, what’s the matter with you? You look depressed.”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever flung himself on to the lounge and groaned hollowly.\r\n\r\n“Damn! Damn!! Damn!!!” he observed.\r\n\r\nHis glassy eye met Jimmy’s and wandered away again.\r\n\r\n“What on earth’s the matter?” demanded Jimmy. “You go out of here\r\ncarolling like a song-bird, and you come back moaning like a lost soul.\r\nWhat’s happened?”\r\n\r\n“Give me a brandy and soda, Pitt, old man, there’s a good chap. I’m in a\r\nfearful hole.”\r\n\r\n“Why? What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“I’m engaged,” groaned his lordship.\r\n\r\n“Engaged? I wish you’d explain. What on earth’s wrong with you! Don’t\r\nyou want to be engaged? What’s your——”\r\n\r\nHe broke off as a sudden, awful suspicion, dawned upon him. “Who is\r\nshe?” he cried.\r\n\r\nHe gripped the stricken peer’s shoulder and shook it savagely.\r\nUnfortunately he selected the precise moment when the latter was in the\r\nact of calming his quivering nerve-centres with a gulp of brandy and\r\nsoda, and for a space of some two minutes it seemed as if the engagement\r\nwould be broken off by the premature extinction of the Dreever line. A\r\nlong and painful fit of coughing, however, ended with his lordship still\r\nalive and on the road to recovery.\r\n\r\nHe eyed Jimmy reproachfully, but Jimmy was in no mood for apologies.\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” he kept demanding. “What’s her name?”\r\n\r\n“Might have killed me,” grumbled the convalescent.\r\n\r\n“Who is she?”\r\n\r\n“What? Why, Miss McEachern.”\r\n\r\nJimmy had known what the answer would be; but it was scarcely less of a\r\nshock for that reason.\r\n\r\n“Miss McEachern?” he echoed.\r\n\r\nLord Dreever nodded a sombre nod.\r\n\r\n“You’re engaged to her?”\r\n\r\nAnother sombre nod.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“I wish I didn’t,” said his lordship wistfully, ignoring the slight\r\nrudeness of the remark. “But worse luck, it’s true.”\r\n\r\nFor the first time since the disclosure of the name Jimmy’s attention\r\nwas directed to the remarkable demeanour of his successful rival.\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem over-pleased,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Pleased! Have a fiver each way on ‘pleased’! No, I’m not exactly\r\nleaping with joy.”\r\n\r\n“Then what the devil is it all about? What do you mean? What’s the idea?\r\nIf you don’t want to marry Miss McEachern, why did you propose to her?”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Dear old boy, don’t. It’s my uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Your uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I explain it all to you?—about him wanting me to marry? You\r\nknow—I told you the whole thing.”\r\n\r\nJimmy stared at him in silence.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say——” he said slowly.\r\n\r\nHe stopped. It was a profanation to put the thing into words.\r\n\r\n“What, old man?”\r\n\r\nJimmy gulped.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say you want to marry Miss McEachern simply because she\r\nhas money?” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that he had heard of a case of a British peer\r\nmarrying for such a reason, but it was the first time that the thing had\r\nfilled him with horror. In some circumstances things come home more\r\nforcibly to us.\r\n\r\n“It’s not me, old man,” murmured his lordship—“it’s my uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Your uncle? Good heavens!” Jimmy clenched his hands despairingly. “Do\r\nyou mean to say that you let your uncle order you about in a thing like\r\nthis? Do you mean to say you’re such a—such a—such a gelatine-backboned\r\nworm——”\r\n\r\n“Old man, I say!” protested his lordship, wounded.\r\n\r\n“I’d call you a wretched knock-kneed skunk, only I don’t want to be\r\nfulsome. I hate flattering a man to his face.”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever, deeply pained, half rose from his seat.\r\n\r\n“Don’t get up,” urged Jimmy smoothly; “I couldn’t trust myself.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship subsided hastily. He was feeling alarmed. He had never seen\r\nthis side of Jimmy’s character. At first he had been merely aggrieved\r\nand disappointed. He had expected sympathy. Now the matter had become\r\nmore serious. Jimmy was pacing the room like a young and hungry tiger.\r\nAt present, it was true, there was a billiard-table between them; but\r\nhis lordship felt that he could have done with good, stout bars. He\r\nnestled in his seat with the earnest concentration of a limpet on a\r\nrock. It would be deuced bad form, of course, for Jimmy to assault his\r\nhost, but could Jimmy be trusted to remember the niceties of etiquette?\r\n\r\n“Why the deuce she accepted you I can’t think,” said Jimmy, half to\r\nhimself, stopping suddenly and glaring across the table.\r\n\r\nLord Dreever felt relieved. This was not polite, perhaps, but at least\r\nit was not violent.\r\n\r\n“That’s what beats me, too, old man,” he said. “Between you and me, it’s\r\na jolly rum business. This afternoon——”\r\n\r\n“What about this afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“Why, she wouldn’t have me at any price.”\r\n\r\n“You asked her this afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and it was all right then. She refused me like a bird, wouldn’t\r\nhear of it, came pretty near laughing in my face; and then to-night,” he\r\nwent on, his voice squeaky at the thought of his wrongs, “my uncle sends\r\nfor me and says she’s changed her mind and is waiting for me in the\r\nmorning-room. I go there and she tells me in about three words that\r\nshe’s been thinking it over and that the whole fearful thing is on\r\nagain. I call it jolly rough on a chap. I felt such a frightful ass, you\r\nknow, I didn’t know what to do—whether to kiss her, I mean——”\r\n\r\nJimmy snorted violently.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said his lordship blankly.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Jimmy, between his teeth.\r\n\r\n“I felt a fearful fool, you know. I just said ‘Right-O!’ or\r\nsomething—dashed if I know what I did say—and legged it. It’s a jolly\r\nrum business, the whole thing. It isn’t as if she wanted me—I could see\r\nthat with half an eye—she doesn’t care a hang for me. It’s my belief,\r\nold man,” he said solemnly, “that she’s been badgered into it. I believe\r\nmy uncle’s been at her.”\r\n\r\nJimmy laughed shortly.\r\n\r\n“My dear man, you seem to think your uncle’s persuasive influence is\r\nuniversal. I guess it’s confined to you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow, I believe that’s what’s happened. What do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Why say anything? There doesn’t seem to be much need.”\r\n\r\nHe poured some brandy into a glass and added a little soda.\r\n\r\n“You take it pretty stiff,” observed his lordship, with a touch of envy.\r\n\r\n“On occasions,” said Jimmy, emptying his glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 18 ★\r\n                         _The Lochinvar Method_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Jimmy sat smoking a last cigarette in his bedroom before going to bed\r\nthat night Spike Mullins came in. Jimmy had been thinking things over.\r\nHe was one of those men who are at their best in a losing game. Imminent\r\ndisaster always had the effect of keying him up and putting an edge on\r\nhis mind. The news he had heard that night had left him with\r\nundiminished determination, but conscious that a change of method would\r\nbe needed. He must stake all on a single throw now. Young Lochinvar\r\nrather than Romeo must be his model. He declined to believe himself\r\nincapable of getting anything that he wanted as badly as he wanted\r\nMolly. He also declined to believe that she was really attached to Lord\r\nDreever. He suspected the hand of McEachern in the affair, though the\r\nsuspicion did not clear up the mystery by any means. Molly was a girl of\r\ncharacter, not a feminine counterpart of his lordship, content meekly to\r\ndo what she was told in a matter of this kind. The whole thing puzzled\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Well, Spike?” he said.\r\n\r\nHe was not too pleased at the interruption. He was thinking, and he\r\nwanted to be alone.\r\n\r\nSomething appeared to have disturbed Spike. His bearing was excited.\r\n\r\n“Say, boss! Guess what. You know dat guy dat come dis afternoon?—de guy\r\nfrom de village, dat came wit old man McEachern.”\r\n\r\n“Galer?” said Jimmy. “What about him?”\r\n\r\nThere had been an addition to the guests at the castle that afternoon.\r\nMr. McEachern, walking in the village, had happened upon an old New York\r\nacquaintance of his, who, touring England, had reached Dreever and was\r\nanxious to see the historic castle. Mr. McEachern had brought him\r\nthither, introduced him to Sir Thomas, and now Mr. Samuel Galer was\r\noccupying a room on the same floor as Jimmy’s. He had appeared at dinner\r\nthat night, a short, wooden-faced man, with no more conversation than\r\nHargate. Jimmy had not paid any particular attention to him.\r\n\r\n“What about him?” he said.\r\n\r\n“He’s a ‘sleut’, boss.”\r\n\r\n“A what?”\r\n\r\n“A ‘sleut’.”\r\n\r\n“A detective?”\r\n\r\n“Dat’s right. A fly cop.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think that?”\r\n\r\n“T’ink! Why, I can tell dem by deir eyes and deir feet, and de whole of\r\ndem. I could pick out a fly cop from a bunch of a t’ousand. He’s sure a\r\n’nough ‘sleut’ all right, all right. I seen him rubbering at you, boss.”\r\n\r\n“At me! Why at me? Why, of course, I see now. Our friend McEachern has\r\ngot him in to spy on us.”\r\n\r\n“Dat’s right, boss.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you may be mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Not me, boss. And, say, he ain’t de only one.”\r\n\r\n“What, more detectives? They’ll have to put up ‘House Full’ boards at\r\nthis rate. Who’s the other?”\r\n\r\n“A mug what’s down in de soivants’ hall. I wasn’t so sure of him at\r\nfoist, but now I’m on to his curves. He’s a sleut all right. He’s vally\r\nto Sir Tummas, dis second mug is; but he ain’t no vally! He’s come to\r\nsee no one don’t get busy wit de jools. Say, what do youse t’ink of dem\r\njools, boss?”\r\n\r\n“Finest I ever saw.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dat’s right. A hundred thousand plunks dey set him back. Dey’re de\r\nlimit, ain’t dey? Say, won’t you really——”\r\n\r\n“Spike, I’m surprised at you! Do you know you’re getting a regular\r\nMephistopheles, Spike? Suppose I hadn’t an iron will, what would happen?\r\nYou really must select your subjects of conversation more carefully.\r\nYou’re bad company for the likes of me.”\r\n\r\nSpike shuffled despondently.\r\n\r\n“But, boss——”\r\n\r\nJimmy shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It can’t be done, my lad.”\r\n\r\n“But it can, boss,” protested Spike. “It’s dead easy. I’ve been up to de\r\nroom, and I seen de box what de jools is kept in. Why, it’s de softest\r\never! We could get dem as easy as pullin’ de plug out of a bottle. Why,\r\nsay, dere’s never been such a peach of a place for gettin’ hold of de\r\nstuff as dis house. Dat’s right, boss. Why, look what I got dis\r\nafternoon, just snoopin’ round and not really trying to get busy at all.\r\nIt was just lying about.”\r\n\r\nHe plunged his hand into his pocket and drew it out again. As he\r\nunclosed his fingers Jimmy caught the gleam of precious stones.\r\n\r\n“What the——” he gasped.\r\n\r\nSpike was looking at his treasure-trove with an air of affectionate\r\nproprietorship.\r\n\r\n“Where on earth did you get those?” asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Out of one of de rooms. Dey belonged to one of de loidies. It was de\r\neasiest old t’ing ever, boss. I just went in when dere was nobody\r\naround, and dere dey was on de toible. I never butted into anyt’ing so\r\nsoft.”\r\n\r\n“Spike!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, boss.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember the room you took them from?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. It was de foist on de——”\r\n\r\n“Then just listen to me for a moment, my bright boy. When we’re at\r\nbreakfast to-morrow you want to go to that room and put those things\r\nback—all of them, mind you—just where you found them. Do you\r\nunderstand?”\r\n\r\nSpike’s jaw had fallen.\r\n\r\n“Put dem back, boss?” he faltered.\r\n\r\n“Every single one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Boss!” said Spike plaintively.\r\n\r\n“Remember—every single one of them, just where it belongs. See?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, boss.”\r\n\r\nThe dejection in his voice would have moved the sternest to pity. Gloom\r\nhad enveloped Spike’s spirit. The sunlight had gone out of his life.\r\n\r\nIt had also gone out of the lives of a good many other people at the\r\ncastle. This was mainly due to the growing shadow of the day of the\r\ntheatricals.\r\n\r\nFor pure discomfort there are few things in the world that can compete\r\nwith the final rehearsals of an amateur theatrical performance at a\r\ncountry house. Every day the atmosphere becomes more heavily charged\r\nwith restlessness and depression. The producer of the piece, especially\r\nif he is also the author of it, develops a sort of intermittent\r\ninsanity. He plucks at his moustache, if he has one; at his hair, if he\r\nhas not. He mutters to himself. He gives vent to occasional despairing\r\ncries. The soothing suavity which marked his demeanour in the earlier\r\nrehearsals disappears.\r\n\r\nHe no longer says with a winning smile, “Splendid, old man, splendid!\r\nCouldn’t be better. But I think we’ll take that over just once more, if\r\nyou don’t mind.” Instead, he rolls his eyes and snaps out, “Once more,\r\nplease. This’ll never do. At this rate we might just as well cut out the\r\nshow altogether. What’s that? No, it won’t be all right on the night!\r\nNow, then, once more; and do pull yourselves together this time.” After\r\nwhich the scene is sulkily resumed; and conversation, when the parties\r\nconcerned meet subsequently, is cold and strained.\r\n\r\nMatters had reached this stage at the castle. Everybody was thoroughly\r\ntired of the piece, and, but for the thought of the disappointment which\r\n(presumably) would rack the neighbouring nobility and gentry if it were\r\nnot to be produced, would have resigned their places without a twinge of\r\nregret. People who had schemed to get the best and longest parts were\r\nwishing now that they had been content with First Footman or Giles, a\r\nvillager.\r\n\r\n“I’ll never run an amateur show again as long as I live,” confided\r\nCharteris to Jimmy, almost tearfully. “It’s not good enough. Most of\r\nthem aren’t word-perfect yet.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll be all right——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t say it’ll be all right on the night.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t going to,” said Jimmy. “I was going to say it’ll be all right\r\nafter the night. People will soon forget how badly the thing went.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a nice, comforting sort of man, aren’t you?” said Charteris.\r\n\r\n“Why worry?” said Jimmy. “If you go on like this, it’ll be Westminster\r\nAbbey for you in your prime. You’ll be getting brain fever.”\r\n\r\nJimmy himself was one of the few who were feeling reasonably cheerful.\r\nHe was deriving a keen amusement at present from the manoeuvres of Mr.\r\nSamuel Galer, of New York. This lynx-eyed man, having been instructed by\r\nMr. McEachern to watch Jimmy, was doing so with a thoroughness which\r\nwould have aroused the suspicions of a babe. If Jimmy went to the\r\nbilliard-room after dinner, Mr. Galer was there to keep him company. If,\r\nduring the course of the day, he had occasion to fetch a handkerchief or\r\na cigarette-case from his bedroom, he was sure, on emerging, to stumble\r\nupon Mr. Galer in the corridor. The employees of Dodson’s Private\r\nInquiry Agency believed in earning their salaries.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, after these encounters, Jimmy would come upon Sir Thomas\r\nBlunt’s valet, the other man in whom Spike’s trained eye had discerned\r\nthe distinguishing marks of the sleuth. He was usually somewhere round\r\nthe corner at these moments, and when collided with apologised with\r\ngreat politeness. Jimmy decided that he must have come under suspicion\r\nin this case vicariously, through Spike. Spike, in the servants’ hall,\r\nwould, of course, stand out conspicuously enough to catch the eye of a\r\ndetective on the look out for sin among the servants; and he himself, as\r\nSpike’s employer, had been marked down as a possible confederate.\r\n\r\nIt tickled him to think that both these giant brains should be so\r\ngreatly exercised on his account.\r\n\r\nHe had been watching Molly closely during these days. So far no\r\nannouncement of the engagement had been made. It struck him that\r\npossibly it was being reserved for public mention on the night of the\r\ntheatricals. The whole county would be at the castle then. There could\r\nbe no more fitting moment. He sounded Lord Dreever, and the latter said\r\nmoodily that he was probably right.\r\n\r\n“There’s going to be a dance of sorts after the show,” he said, “and\r\nit’ll be done then, I suppose. No getting out of it after that—it’ll be\r\nall over the county. Trust my uncle for that! He’ll get on a table and\r\nshout it, shouldn’t wonder, and it’ll be in the _Morning Post_ next day\r\nand Katie’ll see it. Only two days more! Oh, Lord!”\r\n\r\nJimmy deduced that Katie was the Savoy girl, concerning whom his\r\nlordship had vouchsafed no particulars save that she was a ripper and\r\nhadn’t a penny.\r\n\r\nOnly two days! Like the Battle of Waterloo, it was going to be a\r\nclose-run affair. More than ever now he realised how much she meant to\r\nhim, and there were moments when it seemed to him that she, too, had\r\nbegun to understand. That night on the terrace seemed somehow to have\r\nchanged their relationship. He thought he had got closer to her—they\r\nwere in touch. Before she had been frank, cheerful, unembarrassed; now\r\nhe noticed a constraint in her manner, a curious shyness. There was a\r\nbarrier between them, but it was not the old barrier. He had ceased to\r\nbe one of a crowd.\r\n\r\nBut it was a race against time. The first day slipped by, a blank, and\r\nthe second, till now it was but a matter of hours. The last afternoon\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nNot even Mr. Samuel Galer, of Dodson’s Private Inquiry Agency, could\r\nhave kept a more unflagging watch than did Jimmy during those hours.\r\nThere was no rehearsal that afternoon, and the members of the company,\r\nin various stages of nervous collapse, strayed distractedly about the\r\ngrounds. First one, then another, would seize upon Molly, while Jimmy,\r\nwatching from afar, cursed their pertinacity.\r\n\r\nAt last she wandered off alone, and Jimmy quitting his ambush, followed.\r\n\r\nShe walked in the direction of the lake. It had been a terribly hot,\r\noppressive afternoon. There was thunder in the air. Through the trees\r\nthe lake glistened invitingly.\r\n\r\nShe was standing at the water’s edge when Jimmy came up. Her back was\r\nturned. She was rocking with her foot a Canadian canoe that lay\r\nalongside the bank. She started as he spoke. His feet on the soft turf\r\nhad made no sound.\r\n\r\n“Can I take you out on the lake?” he said.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer for a moment. She was plainly confused.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “I—I’m waiting for Lord Dreever.”\r\n\r\nJimmy saw that she was nervous. There was tension in the air. She was\r\nlooking away from him, out across the lake, and her face was flushed.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” she said again.\r\n\r\nJimmy looked over his shoulder. Down the lower terrace was approaching\r\nthe long form of his lordship. He walked with pensive jerkiness, not as\r\none hurrying to a welcome tryst. As Jimmy looked up he vanished behind\r\nthe great clump of laurels which stood on the lowest terrace. In another\r\nminute he would appear round them.\r\n\r\nGently, but with extreme despatch, Jimmy placed a hand on either side of\r\nMolly’s waist. The next moment he had swung her off her feet and lowered\r\nher carefully on to the cushions in the bow of the canoe.\r\n\r\nThen, jumping in himself with a force that made the boat rock, he loosed\r\nthe mooring-rope, seized the paddle and pushed off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 19 ★\r\n                             _On the Lake_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making love, as in every other branch of life, consistency is the\r\nquality most to be aimed at. To hedge is fatal. A man must choose the\r\nline of action which he judges to be best suited to his temperament, and\r\nhold to it without deviation. If Lochinvar snatches the maiden up on to\r\nhis saddlebow he must continue in that vein. He must not fancy that,\r\nhaving accomplished the feat, he can resume the episode on lines of\r\ndevotional humility. Prehistoric man, who conducted his courtship with a\r\nclub, never fell into the error of apologising when his bride complained\r\nof headache.\r\n\r\nJimmy did not apologise. The idea did not enter his mind. He was feeling\r\nprehistoric. His heart was beating fast and his mind was in a whirl, but\r\nthe one definite thought that came to him during the first few seconds\r\nof the journey was that he ought to have done this earlier. This was the\r\nright way—pick her up and carry her off and leave uncles and fathers and\r\nbutter-haired peers of the realm to look after themselves. This was the\r\nway—alone together in their own little world of water with nobody to\r\ninterrupt and nobody to overhear. He should have done it before. He had\r\nwasted precious, golden time hanging about while futile men chatted to\r\nher of things that could not possibly be of interest. But he had done\r\nthe right thing at last—he had got her. She must listen to him now. She\r\ncould not help listening. They were the only inhabitants of this new\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHe looked back over his shoulder at the world they had left. The last of\r\nthe Dreevers had rounded the clump of laurels, and was standing at the\r\nedge of the water, gazing perplexedly after the retreating canoe.\r\n\r\n“These poets put a thing very neatly sometimes,” said Jimmy,\r\nreflectively, as he dug the paddle into the water. “The man who said\r\n‘Distance lends enchantment to the view’, for instance. Dreever looks\r\nquite nice when you see him as far away as this, with a good strip of\r\nwater in between.”\r\n\r\nMolly, gazing over the side of the boat into the lake, abstained from\r\nfeasting her eyes on the picturesque spectacle.\r\n\r\n“Why did you do it?” she said, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nJimmy shipped the paddle and allowed the canoe to drift. The ripple of\r\nthe water against the prow sounded clear and thin in the stillness. The\r\nworld seemed asleep. The sun blazed down, turning the water to flame.\r\nThe air was hot with the damp, electric heat that heralds a\r\nthunderstorm. Molly’s face looked small and cool in the shade of her big\r\nhat. Jimmy, as he watched her, felt that he had done well. This was,\r\nindeed, the way.\r\n\r\n“Why did you do it?” she said again.\r\n\r\n“I had to.”\r\n\r\n“Take me back.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nHe took up the paddle and placed a broader strip of water between the\r\ntwo worlds, then paused once more.\r\n\r\n“I have something to say to you first,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. He looked over his shoulder again. His lordship had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n“Do you mind if I smoke?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded. He filled his pipe carefully and lit it. The smoke moved\r\nsluggishly up through the still air. There was a long silence. A fish\r\njumped close by, falling back in a shower of silver drops. Molly started\r\nat the sound and half turned.\r\n\r\n“That was a fish,” she said, as a child might have done.\r\n\r\nJimmy knocked the ashes out of his pipe.\r\n\r\n“What made you do it?” he asked abruptly echoing her own question.\r\n\r\nShe drew her fingers slowly through the water without speaking.\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean. Dreever told me.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up with a flash of spirit, which died away as she spoke.\r\n\r\n“What right?” She stopped and looked away again.\r\n\r\n“None,” said Jimmy. “But I wish you would tell me.”\r\n\r\nShe hung her head. Jimmy bent forward and touched her hand.\r\n\r\n“Don’t,” he said. “For Heaven’s sake, don’t! You mustn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I must,” she said miserably.\r\n\r\n“You shan’t! It’s wicked.”\r\n\r\n“I must. It’s no good talking about it—it’s too late.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not. You must break it off to-day.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. Her fingers still dabbled mechanically in the water.\r\nThe sun was hidden now behind a grey veil, which deepened into a sullen\r\nblack over the hill behind the castle. The heat had grown more\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\n“What made you do it?” he asked again.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let’s talk about it, please!”\r\n\r\nHe had a momentary glimpse of her face. There were tears in her eyes. At\r\nthe sight his self-control snapped.\r\n\r\n“You sha’n’t!” he cried. “It’s ghastly. I won’t let you. You must\r\nunderstand now—you must know what you are to me. Do you think I shall\r\nlet you——”\r\n\r\nA low growl of thunder rumbled through the stillness, like the muttering\r\nof a sleepy giant. The black cloud which had hung over the hill had\r\ncrept closer. The heat was stifling. In the middle of the lake, some\r\nfifty yards distant, lay the island, cool and mysterious in the\r\ngathering darkness.\r\n\r\nHe broke off and seized the paddle.\r\n\r\nOn this side of the island was a boat-house—a little creek, covered over\r\nwith boards, and capable of sheltering an ordinary row-boat. He ran the\r\ncanoe in just as the storm began, and turned her broadside on so that\r\nthey could watch the rain, which was sweeping over the lake in sheets.\r\n\r\nHe began to speak again, more slowly now.\r\n\r\n“I think I loved you from the first day I saw you on the ship—and then I\r\nlost you. I found you again by a miracle, and lost you again; I found\r\nyou here by another miracle, but this time I am not going to lose you.\r\nDo you think I am going to stand by and see you taken from me by—by——”\r\n\r\nHe took her hand.\r\n\r\n“Molly, you can’t love him. It isn’t possible. If I thought you did, I\r\nwouldn’t try to spoil your happiness—I’d go away. But you don’t—you\r\ncan’t. He’s nothing. Molly!”\r\n\r\n“Molly!”\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, but for the first time her eyes met his, clear and\r\nunwavering. He could read fear in them, fear—not of himself, of\r\nsomething vague, something he could not guess at. But they shone with a\r\nlight which conquered the fear as the sun conquers fire; and he drew her\r\nto him, and kissed her again and again, murmuring incoherently.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she wrenched herself away, struggling like some wild thing. The\r\nboat plunged.\r\n\r\n“I can’t!” she cried, in a choking voice. “I mustn’t! Oh, I can’t!”\r\n\r\nHe stretched out a hand and clutched at the rail that ran along the\r\nwall. The plunging ceased. He turned. She had hidden her face, and was\r\nsobbing, quietly, with the forlorn hopelessness of a lost child.\r\n\r\nHe made a movement towards her, but drew back. He felt dazed.\r\n\r\nThe rain thudded and splashed on the wooden roof. A few drops trickled\r\nthrough a crack in the boards. He took off his coat and placed it gently\r\nover her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Molly!”\r\n\r\nShe looked up with wet eyes.\r\n\r\n“Molly dear, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“I mustn’t. It isn’t right.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“I mustn’t, Jimmy.”\r\n\r\nHe moved cautiously forward, holding the rail till he was at her side,\r\nand took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n“What is it, dear? Tell me.”\r\n\r\nShe clung to him without speaking.\r\n\r\n“You aren’t worrying about him, are you—about Dreever? There’s nothing\r\nto worry about. It’ll be quite easy and simple. I’ll tell him if you\r\nlike. He knows you don’t care for him, and besides, there’s another girl\r\nin London that he——”\r\n\r\n“No, no; it’s not that.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, dear? What’s troubling you?”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy——” She stopped.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy, father wouldn’t. Father—father doesn’t——”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t like me?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded miserably.\r\n\r\nA great wave of relief swept over Jimmy. He had imagined—he hardly knew\r\nwhat he had imagined—some vast, insuperable obstacle, some tremendous\r\ncatastrophe whirling them asunder. He could have laughed aloud in his\r\nhappiness. So this was it, this was the cloud that brooded over\r\nthem—that Mr. McEachern did not like him! The angel, guarding Eden with\r\na fiery sword, had changed into a policeman with a truncheon.\r\n\r\n“He must learn to love me,” he said lightly.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him hopelessly. He could not see, he could not understand.\r\nAnd how could she tell him? Her father’s words rang in her brain. He was\r\n“crooked”; he was “here on some game”; he was being watched. But she\r\nloved him—she loved him. Oh, how could she make him understand?\r\n\r\nShe clung tighter to him, trembling. He became serious again.\r\n\r\n“Dear, you mustn’t worry,” he said. “It can’t be helped. He’ll come\r\nround. Once we’re married——”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Oh, can’t you understand? I couldn’t—I couldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“But, dear,” he said, “you can’t— Do you mean to say— Will that——“(he\r\nsearched for a word)—“stop you?” he concluded.\r\n\r\n“It must,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nA cold hand clutched at his heart. His world was falling to pieces,\r\ncrumbling under his eyes.\r\n\r\n“But—but you love me,” he said slowly. It was as if he were trying to\r\nfind the key to a puzzle.\r\n\r\n“I—don’t see——”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t—you can’t. You’re a man—you don’t know—it’s so different\r\nfor a man. He’s brought up all his life with the idea of leaving home,\r\nhe goes away naturally.”\r\n\r\n“But, dear, you couldn’t live at home all your life. Whoever you\r\nmarried——”\r\n\r\n“But this would be different. Father would never speak to me again— I\r\nshould never see him again. He would go right out of my life. Jimmy, I\r\ncouldn’t. A girl can’t cut away twenty years of her life and start\r\nafresh like that. I should be haunted. I should make you miserable.\r\nEvery day a hundred little things would remind me of him, and I\r\nshouldn’t be strong enough to resist them. You don’t know how fond he is\r\nof me, how good he has always been. Ever since I can remember, we’ve\r\nbeen such friends. You’ve only seen the outside of him, and I know how\r\ndifferent that is from what he really is. All his life he has thought\r\nonly of me. He has told me things about himself which nobody else dreams\r\nof, and I know that all these years he has been working just for me.\r\nJimmy, you don’t hate me for saying this, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” he said, drawing her closer to him.\r\n\r\n“I can’t remember my mother—she died when I was quite little—so he and I\r\nhave been the only ones, till you came.”\r\n\r\nMemories of those early days crowded her mind as she spoke, making her\r\nvoice tremble; half-forgotten trifles, many of them, fraught with the\r\nglamour and fragrance of past happiness.\r\n\r\n“We have always been together. He trusted me and I trusted him, and we\r\nsaw things through together. When I was ill he used to sit up all night\r\nwith me, night after night. Once—I’d only got a little fever really, but\r\nI thought I was terribly bad—I heard him come in late and called out to\r\nhim, and he came straight in and sat and held my hand all through the\r\nnight; and it was only by accident I found out later that it had been\r\nraining, and that he was soaked through. It might have killed him. We\r\nwere partners, Jimmy dear. I couldn’t do anything to hurt him now, could\r\nI? It wouldn’t be square.”\r\n\r\nJimmy turned away his head, for fear his face might betray what he was\r\nfeeling. He was in a hell of unreasoning jealousy. He wanted her, body\r\nand soul, and every word she said bit like a raw wound. A moment before\r\nand he had felt that she belonged to him; now, in the first shock of\r\nreaction, he saw himself a stranger, an intruder, a trespasser on holy\r\nground.\r\n\r\nShe saw the movement, and her intuition put her in touch with his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” she cried. “No, Jimmy—not that!”\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, and he was satisfied.\r\n\r\nThey sat there silent. The rain had lessened its force and was falling\r\nnow in a gentle shower; a strip of blue sky, pale and watery, showed\r\nthrough the grey over the hills. On the island close behind them a\r\nthrush had begun to sing.\r\n\r\n“What are we to do?” she said at last. “What can we do?”\r\n\r\n“We must wait,” he said. “It will all come right. It must. Nothing can\r\nstop us now.”\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased. The blue had routed the grey and driven it from the\r\nsky. The sun, low down in the west, shone out bravely over the lake. The\r\nair was cool and fresh.\r\n\r\nJimmy’s spirits rose with a bound. He accepted the omen. This was the\r\nworld as it really was, smiling and friendly, not grey, as he had\r\nfancied it. He had won. Nothing could alter that. What remained to be\r\ndone was trivial. He wondered how he could ever have allowed it to weigh\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he pushed the boat out of its shelter on to the glittering\r\nwater, and seized the paddle.\r\n\r\n“We must be getting back,” he said. “I wonder what the time is? I wish\r\nwe could stay out for ever. But it must be late. Molly!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Whatever happens, you’ll break off this engagement with Dreever? Shall\r\nI tell him? I will if you like.”\r\n\r\n“No, I will. I’ll write him a note if I don’t see him before dinner.”\r\n\r\nJimmy paddled on a few strokes.\r\n\r\n“It’s no good,” he said suddenly; “I can’t keep it in. Molly, do you\r\nmind if I sing a bar or two? I’ve got a beastly voice, but I’m feeling\r\nrather happy. I’ll stop as soon as I can.”\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice discordantly.\r\n\r\nCovertly, from beneath the shade of her big hat, Molly watched him with\r\ntroubled eyes. The sun had gone down behind the hills, and the water had\r\nceased to glitter. There was a suggestion of chilliness in the air. The\r\ngreat mass of the castle frowned down upon them, dark and forbidding in\r\nthe dim light.\r\n\r\nShe shivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 20 ★\r\n                          _A Lesson in Piquet_\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Dreever, meanwhile, having left the waterside, lit a cigarette, and\r\nproceeded to make a reflective tour of the grounds. He felt aggrieved\r\nwith the world. Molly’s desertion in the canoe with Jimmy did not\r\ntrouble him. He had other sorrows. One is never at one’s best and\r\nsunniest when one has been forced by a ruthless uncle into abandoning\r\nthe girl one loves and becoming engaged to another to whom one is\r\nindifferent. Something of a jaundiced tinge stains one’s outlook on life\r\nin such circumstances. Moreover, Lord Dreever was not by nature an\r\nintrospective young man, but, examining his position as he walked along,\r\nhe found himself wondering whether it was not a little unheroic. He came\r\nto the conclusion that perhaps it was.\r\n\r\nOf course, Uncle Thomas could make it deucedly unpleasant for him if he\r\nkicked—that was the trouble. If only he had even, say, a couple of\r\nthousand a year of his own, he might make a fight for it. But, dash it!\r\nUncle Tom could cut off supplies to such a frightful extent, if there\r\nwas trouble, that he would have to go on living at Dreever indefinitely,\r\nwithout so much as a fearful quid to call his own. Imagination boggled\r\nat the prospect. In the summer and autumn, when there was shooting, his\r\nlordship was not indisposed to stay at the home of his fathers. But all\r\nthe year round! Better a broken heart inside the radius than a sound one\r\nin the country in the winter.\r\n\r\n“But, by gad,” mused his lordship, “if I had as much as a couple—yes,\r\ndash it! even a couple of thousand a year, I’d chance it and ask Katie\r\nto marry me, dashed if I wouldn’t!”\r\n\r\nHe walked on, drawing thoughtfully at his cigarette. The more he\r\nreviewed the situation, the less he liked it. There was only one bright\r\nspot in it, and that was the feeling that now money must surely get a\r\nshade less tight. Extracting the precious ore from Sir Thomas hitherto\r\nhad been like pulling back-teeth out of a bulldog. But now, on the\r\nstrength of this infernal engagement, surely he might reasonably be\r\nexpected to scatter largesse to some extent.\r\n\r\nHis lordship was just wondering whether, if approached in a softened\r\nmood, the other might not disgorge something quite big, when a large,\r\nwarm rain-drop fell on his hand. From the bushes round about came an\r\never-increasing patter. The sky was leaden.\r\n\r\nHe looked round him for shelter. He had reached the rose-garden in the\r\ncourse of his perambulations. At the far end was a summer-house. He\r\nturned up his coat-collar and ran.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near he heard a slow and dirge-like whistling proceeding from\r\nthe interior. Plunging in out of breath, just as the deluge began, he\r\nfound Hargate seated at the little wooden table with an earnest\r\nexpression on his face. The table was covered with cards. Hargate had\r\nnot yet been compelled to sprain his wrist, having adopted the\r\nalternative of merely refusing invitations to play billiards.\r\n\r\n“Halloa, Hargate!” said his lordship. “Isn’t it coming down, by Jove!”\r\n\r\nHargate glanced up, nodded without speaking, and turned his attention to\r\nthe cards once more. He took one from the pack in his left hand, looked\r\nat it, hesitated for a moment, as if doubtful whereabouts on the table\r\nit would produce the most artistic effect, and finally put it face\r\nupwards. Then he moved another card from the table and put it on top of\r\nthe other one. Throughout the performance he whistled painfully.\r\n\r\nHis lordship regarded him with annoyance.\r\n\r\n“That looks frightfully exciting,” he said disparagingly. “What are you\r\nplaying at? Patience?”\r\n\r\nHargate nodded again—this time without looking up.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t sit there looking like a frog,” said Lord Dreever irritably.\r\n“Talk, man.”\r\n\r\nHargate gathered up the cards and proceeded to shuffle them in a\r\nmeditative manner, whistling the while.\r\n\r\n“Oh, stop it!” said his lordship.\r\n\r\nHargate nodded, and stopped.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Lord Dreever, “this is boring me stiff. Let’s have a\r\ngame at something—anything to pass away the time. Hang this rain! We\r\nshall be cooped up here till dinner at this rate. Ever played piquet? I\r\ncould teach you in five minutes.”\r\n\r\nA look almost of awe came into Hargate’s face—the look of one who sees a\r\nmiracle performed before his eyes. For years he had been using all the\r\nlarge stock of diplomacy at his command to induce callow youths to play\r\npiquet with him, and here was this admirable young man, this pearl among\r\nyoung men, positively offering to teach him the game. It was too much\r\nhappiness. What had he done to deserve this? He felt as a toil-worn lion\r\nmight feel if some antelope, instead of making its customary bee-line\r\nfor the horizon, were to trot up and insert its head between his jaws.\r\n\r\n“I— I shouldn’t mind being shown the idea,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe listened attentively while Lord Dreever explained at some length the\r\nprinciples which govern the game of piquet. Every now and then he asked\r\na question. It was evident that he was beginning to grasp the idea of\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\n“What exactly is re-piquing?” he asked, as his lordship paused.\r\n\r\n“It’s like this,” said his lordship, returning to his lecture.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I see now,” said the neophyte.\r\n\r\nThey began playing. Lord Dreever, as was only to be expected in a\r\ncontest between teacher and student, won the first two hands. Hargate\r\nwon the next.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got the hang of it all right now,” he said complacently. “It’s a\r\nsimple sort of game. Make it more exciting, don’t you think, if we\r\nplayed for something?”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Lord Dreever slowly; “if you like.”\r\n\r\nHe would not have suggested it himself, but after all, dash it! if the\r\nman simply asked for it—— It was not his fault if the winning of a hand\r\nshould have given the fellow the impression that he knew all that there\r\nwas to be known about piquet. Of course, piquet was a game where skill\r\nwas practically bound to win. But—— After all, Hargate probably had\r\nplenty of money. He could afford it.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said his lordship again. “How much?”\r\n\r\n“Something fairly moderate. Ten bob a hundred?”\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that his lordship ought, at this suggestion, to have\r\ncorrected the novice’s notion that ten shillings a hundred was fairly\r\nmoderate. He knew that it was possible for a poor player to lose four\r\nhundred points in a twenty minutes’ game, and usual for him to lose two\r\nhundred. But he let the thing go.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” he said.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later Hargate was looking somewhat ruefully at the\r\nscore-sheet. “I owe you eighteen shillings,” he said. “Shall I pay you\r\nnow, or shall we settle up in a lump after we’ve finished?”\r\n\r\n“What about stopping now?” said Lord Dreever. “It’s quite fine out.”\r\n\r\n“No; let’s go on. I’ve nothing to do till dinner, and I don’t suppose\r\nyou have.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship’s conscience made one last effort.\r\n\r\n“You’d much better stop, you know, Hargate, really,” he said. “You can\r\nlose a frightful lot at this game.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Dreever,” said Hargate stiffly, “I can look after myself,\r\nthanks. Of course, if you think you are risking too much, by all\r\nmeans——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you don’t mind,” said his lordship, outraged, “I’m only too\r\nfrightfully pleased. Only remember I warned you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll bear it in mind. By the way, before we start, care to make it a\r\nsovereign a hundred?”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever could not afford to play piquet for a sovereign a hundred,\r\nor, indeed, to play piquet for money at all; but after his adversary’s\r\ninnuendo it was impossible for a young gentleman of spirit to admit the\r\nhumiliating fact. He nodded.\r\n\r\n“About time, I fancy,” said Hargate, looking at his watch an hour later,\r\n“that we were going in to dress for dinner.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship made no reply. He was wrapped in thought.\r\n\r\n“Let’s see, that’s twenty pounds you owe me, isn’t it?” continued\r\nHargate. “Shocking bad luck you had.”\r\n\r\nThey went out into the rose-garden.\r\n\r\n“Jolly everything smells after the rain,” said Hargate, who seemed to\r\nhave struck a conversational patch. “Freshened everything up.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship did not appear to have noticed it. He seemed to be thinking\r\nof something else. His air was pensive and abstracted.\r\n\r\n“There’s just time,” said Hargate, looking at his watch again, “for a\r\nshort stroll. I want to have a talk with you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Lord Dreever.\r\n\r\nHis air did not belie his feelings. He looked pensive, and he was\r\npensive. It was deuced awkward, this twenty pounds business.\r\n\r\nHargate was watching him covertly. It was his business to know other\r\npeople’s business, and he knew that Lord Dreever was impecunious, and\r\ndepended for supplies entirely on a prehensile uncle. For the success of\r\nthe proposal he was about to make he relied on this fact.\r\n\r\n“Who’s this man Pitt?” asked Hargate.\r\n\r\n“Oh, pal of mine,” said his lordship. “Why?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t stand the fellow.”\r\n\r\n“I think he’s a good chap,” said his lordship. “In fact,” remembering\r\nJimmy’s Good Samaritanism, “I know he is. Why don’t you like him?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said his lordship indifferently. He was in no mood to listen to\r\nthe likes and dislikes of other men.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Dreever,” said Hargate, “I want you to do something for me—I\r\nwant you to get Pitt out of the place.”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever eyed him curiously.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” he said. Hargate repeated his remark.\r\n\r\n“You seem to have mapped out quite a programme for me,” said Lord\r\nDreever.\r\n\r\n“Get him out of it,” continued Hargate vehemently. Jimmy’s prohibition\r\nagainst billiards had hit him hard. He was suffering the torments of\r\nTantalus. The castle was full of young men of the kind to whom he most\r\nresorted—easy marks, every one—and here he was, simply through Jimmy,\r\ncareened like a disabled battleship. It was maddening. “Make him go. You\r\ninvited him here. He doesn’t expect to stop indefinitely, I suppose? If\r\nyou left, he’d have to, too. What you must do is to go back to London\r\nto-morrow. You can easily make some excuse. He’ll have to go with you.\r\nThen you can drop him in London and come back. That’s what you must do.”\r\n\r\nA delicate pink flush might have been seen to spread itself over Lord\r\nDreever’s face. He began to look like an angry rabbit. He had not a\r\ngreat deal of pride in his composition, but the thought of the\r\nignominious _role_ which Hargate was sketching out for him stirred what\r\nhe had to its shallow bottom.\r\n\r\nTalking on, Hargate managed to add the last straw.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he said, “that money you lost to me at piquet—what was it?\r\nTwenty? Twenty pounds, wasn’t it? Well, we would look on that as\r\ncancelled, of course. That will be all right.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship exploded.\r\n\r\n“Will it?” he cried, pink to the ears. “Will it, by George? I’ll pay you\r\nevery frightful penny of it to-morrow—and then you can clear out,\r\ninstead of Pitt. What do you take me for, I should like to know?”\r\n\r\n“A fool, if you refuse my offer.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve a jolly good mind to give you a most frightful kicking.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t try if I were you. It’s not the sort of game you’d shine\r\nat. Better stick to piquet.”\r\n\r\n“If you think I can’t pay you your rotten money—”\r\n\r\n“I do. But if you can, so much the better. Money is always useful.”\r\n\r\n“I may be a fool in some ways——”\r\n\r\n“You understate it, my dear man.”\r\n\r\n“But I’m not a cad.”\r\n\r\n“You’re getting quite rosy, Dreever. Wrath is good for the complexion.”\r\n\r\n“And if you think you can bribe me, you never made a bigger mistake in\r\nyour life.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did,” said Hargate, “when I thought you had some glimmerings of\r\nintelligence. But if it gives you any pleasure to behave like the\r\njuvenile lead in a melodrama, by all means do. Personally, I shouldn’t\r\nhave thought the game would be worth the candle. But if your keen sense\r\nof honour compels you to pay the twenty pounds, all right. You mentioned\r\nto-morrow? That’ll suit me. So we’ll let it go at that.”\r\n\r\nHe walked off, leaving Lord Dreever filled with that comfortable glow\r\nwhich comes to the weak man who for once has displayed determination. He\r\nfelt that he must not go back from his dignified stand-point. That money\r\nwould have to be paid, and on the morrow. Hargate was the sort of man\r\nwho could, and would, make it exceedingly unpleasant for him if he\r\nfailed. A debt of honour was not a thing to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nBut he felt quite safe. He knew he could get the money when he pleased.\r\nIt showed, he reflected philosophically, how out of evil cometh good.\r\nHis greater misfortune, the engagement, would, as it were, neutralise\r\nthe loss, for it was ridiculous to suppose that Sir Thomas, having seen\r\nhis ends accomplished, and being presumably in a spacious mood in\r\nconsequence, would not be amenable to a request for a mere twenty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nHe went on into the hall. He felt strong and capable. He had shown\r\nHargate the stuff there was in him. He was Spennie Dreever, the man of\r\nblood and iron, the man with whom it was best not to trifle. But it was\r\nreally, come to think of it, uncommonly lucky that he was engaged to\r\nMolly. He recoiled from the idea of attempting, unfortified by that\r\nfact, to extract twenty pounds from Sir Thomas for a card debt.\r\n\r\nIn the hall he met Saunders.\r\n\r\n“I have been looking for your lordship,” said the butler.\r\n\r\n“Eh? Well, here I am.”\r\n\r\n“Just so, your lordship. Miss McEachern entrusted me with this note to\r\ndeliver to you in the event of her not being able to see you before\r\ndinner personally, your lordship.”\r\n\r\n“Right-O. Thanks.”\r\n\r\nHe started to go upstairs, opening the envelope as he went. What could\r\nthe girl be writing to him about? Surely she wasn’t going to start\r\nsending him love-letters or any of that frightful rot? Deuced difficult\r\nit would be to play up to that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nHe stopped on the landing to read the note, and at the first line his\r\njaw fell. The envelope fluttered to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my sainted aunt!” he moaned, clutching at the banisters. “Now I am\r\nin the soup!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 21 ★\r\n                           _Loathsome Gifts_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are doubtless men so constructed that they can find themselves\r\naccepted suitors without any particular whirl of emotion. King Solomon\r\nprobably belonged to this class, and even Henry VIII must have become a\r\ntrifle blasé in time. But to the average man the sensations are complex\r\nand overwhelming. A certain stunned feeling is perhaps predominant.\r\nBlended with this is relief—the relief of a general who has brought a\r\ndifficult campaign to a successful end, or a member of a forlorn hope\r\nwho finds that the danger is over and that he is still alive. To this\r\nmust be added a newly-born sense of magnificence. Our suspicion that we\r\nwere something rather out of the ordinary run of men is suddenly\r\nconfirmed. Our bosom heaves with complacency, and the world has nothing\r\nmore to offer.\r\n\r\nWith some there is an alloy of apprehension in the metal of their\r\nhappiness, and the strain of an engagement sometimes brings with it even\r\na faint shadow of regret. “She makes me buy things,” one swain, in the\r\nthird quarter of his engagement, was overhead to moan to a friend. “Two\r\nnew ties only yesterday.” He seemed to be debating within himself\r\nwhether human nature could stand the strain.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever tragedies may cloud the end of the period, its beginning\r\nat least is bathed in sunshine.\r\n\r\nJimmy, regarding his lathered face in the glass as he dressed for dinner\r\nthat night, marvelled at the excellence of this best of all possible\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\nNo doubts disturbed him. That the relations between Mr. McEachern and\r\nhimself offered a permanent bar to his prospects he did not believe. For\r\nthe moment he declined to consider the existence of the ex-constable at\r\nall. In a world that contained Molly there was no room for other people.\r\nThey were not in the picture. They did not exist.\r\n\r\nTo him, musing contentedly over the goodness of life, there entered, in\r\nthe furtive manner habitual to that unreclaimed buccaneer, Spike\r\nMullins. It may have been that Jimmy read his own satisfaction and\r\nhappiness into the faces of others, but it certainly seemed to him that\r\nthere was a sort of restrained joyfulness about Spike’s demeanour. The\r\nBowery boy’s shuffles on the carpet were almost a dance. His face seemed\r\nto glow beneath his crimson hair.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jimmy, “and how goes the world with young Lord FitzMullins?\r\nSpike, have you ever been best man?”\r\n\r\n“What’s dat, boss?”\r\n\r\n“Best man at a wedding—chap who stands by the bridegroom with a hand on\r\nthe scruff of his neck to see that he goes through with it. Fellow who\r\nlooks after everything, crowds the money on to the minister at the end\r\nof the ceremony, and then goes off and marries the first bridesmaid and\r\nlives happily ever after.”\r\n\r\nSpike shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t got no use for gettin’ married, boss.”\r\n\r\n“Spike the misogynist! You wait, Spike. Some day love will awake in your\r\nheart, and you’ll start writing poetry.”\r\n\r\n“I’se not dat kind of mug, boss,” protested the Bowery boy. “I ain’t got\r\nno use for goils. It’s a mutt’s game.”\r\n\r\nThis was rank heresy. Jimmy laid down the razor from motives of\r\nprudence, and proceeded to lighten Spike’s reprehensible darkness.\r\n\r\n“Spike, you’re an ass,” he said. “You don’t know anything about it. If\r\nyou had any sense at all, you’d understand that the only thing worth\r\ndoing in life is to get married. You bone-headed bachelors make me ill.\r\nThink what it would mean to you, having a wife. Think of going out on a\r\ncold winter’s night to crack a crib, knowing that there would be a cup\r\nof hot soup waiting for you when you got back, and your slippers all\r\nwarmed and comfortable. And then she’d sit on your knee, and you’d tell\r\nher how you shot the policeman, and you’d examine the swag together!\r\nWhy, I can’t imagine anything cosier. Perhaps there would be little\r\nSpikes running about the house. Can’t you see them jumping with joy as\r\nyou slid in through the window and told the great news? ‘Fahzer’s killed\r\na pleeceman!’ cry the tiny, eager voices. Sweets are served out all\r\nround in honour of the event. Golden haired little Jimmy Mullins, my\r\ngodson, gets sixpence for having thrown a stone at a plain clothes\r\ndetective that afternoon. All is joy and wholesome revelry. Take my word\r\nfor it, Spike, there’s nothing like domesticity.”\r\n\r\n“Dere was a goil once,” said Spike, meditatively. “Only I was never her\r\nsteady. She married a cop.”\r\n\r\n“She wasn’t worthy of you, Spike,” said Jimmy sympathetically. “A girl\r\ncapable of going to the bad like that would never have done for you. You\r\nmust pick up some nice, sympathetic girl with a romantic admiration for\r\nyour line of business. Meanwhile, let me finish shaving, or I shall be\r\nlate for dinner. Great doings on to-night, Spike.”\r\n\r\nSpike became animated.\r\n\r\n“Sure, boss! Dat’s just what——”\r\n\r\n“If you could collect all the blue blood that will be under this roof\r\nto-night, Spike, into one vat, you’d be able to start a dyeing works.\r\nDon’t try, though. They mightn’t like it. By the way, have you seen\r\nanything more—of course you have. What I mean is, have you talked at all\r\nwith that valet man—the one you think is a detective?”\r\n\r\n“Why, boss, dat’s just——”\r\n\r\n“I hope, for his own sake, he’s a better performer than my old friend\r\nGaler. That man is getting on my nerves, Spike. He pursues me like a\r\nsmell dog. I expect he’s lurking out in the passage now. Did you see\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“Did I! Boss! Why——”\r\n\r\nJimmy inspected Spike gravely.\r\n\r\n“Spike,” he said, “there’s something on your mind. You’re trying to say\r\nsomething. What is it? Out with it.”\r\n\r\nSpike’s excitement vented itself in a rush of words.\r\n\r\n“Gee, boss! There’s bin doin’s to-night for fair. Me coco’s still\r\nbuzzin’. Sure t’ing! Why, say, when I was to Sir Tummas’s dressing-room\r\ndis afternoon——”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Surest t’ing, you know. Just before de storm come on, when it was all\r\nas dark as could be. Well, I was——”\r\n\r\nJimmy interrupted.\r\n\r\n“In Sir Thomas’s dressing-room! What——”\r\n\r\nSpike looked somewhat embarrassed. He grinned apologetically and\r\nshuffled his feet.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got dem, boss,” he said, with a smirk.\r\n\r\n“Got them? Got what?”\r\n\r\n“Dese.”\r\n\r\nHe plunged his hand in his pocket and drew forth, in a glittering mass,\r\nLady Julia Blunt’s rope of diamonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 22 ★\r\n                   _How Two of a Trade did not Agree_\r\n\r\n\r\n“One hundred t’ousand plunks,” murmured Spike, gazing lovingly at them.\r\n“I says to meself, ‘De boss ain’t got no time to be gettin’ after dem\r\nhimself. He’s too busy dese days wit jollyin’ along de swells. So it’s\r\nup to me,’ I says, ‘’cos de boss’ll be tickled to deat’, all right, all\r\nright, if we can git away wit dem.’ So I——”\r\n\r\nJimmy gave tongue with an energy which amazed his faithful follower. The\r\nnightmare horror of the situation had affected him much as a sudden blow\r\nin the parts about the waistcoat might have done. But now, as Spike\r\nwould have said, he caught up with his breath. The smirk faded slowly\r\nfrom the other’s face as he listened. Not even in the Bowery, full as it\r\nwas of candid friends, had he listened to such a trenchant summing-up of\r\nhis mental and moral deficiencies.\r\n\r\n“Boss!” he protested.\r\n\r\n“That’s just a sketchy outline,” said Jimmy, pausing for breath. “I\r\ncan’t do you justice impromptu like this. You’re too vast and\r\noverwhelming.”\r\n\r\n“But, boss, what’s eatin’ you? Ain’t youse tickled?”\r\n\r\n“Tickled!” Jimmy sawed the air. “Tickled! You lunatic! Can’t you see\r\nwhat you’ve done?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got dem,” said Spike, whose mind was not readily receptive of new\r\nideas. It seemed to him that Jimmy missed the main point.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I tell you there was nothing doing when you wanted to take those\r\nthings the other day?”\r\n\r\nSpike’s face cleared. As he had suspected, Jimmy had missed the point.\r\n\r\n“Why, say, boss, yes—sure. But dose was little dinky t’ings. Of course,\r\nyouse wouldn’t stand for swipin’ chicken-feed like dem. But dese is\r\ndifferent. Dese di’monds is boids. It’s one hundred thousand plunks fer\r\ndese.”\r\n\r\n“Spike!” said Jimmy, with painful calm.\r\n\r\n“Huh?”\r\n\r\n“Will you listen for a moment?”\r\n\r\n“Sure.”\r\n\r\n“I know it’s practically hopeless. To get an idea into your head one\r\nwants a proper outfit—drills, blasting-powder, and so on. But there’s\r\njust a chance, perhaps, if I talk slowly. Has it occurred to you,\r\nSpike—my bonny, blue-eyed Spike—that every other man, more or less, in\r\nthis stately home of England is a detective who has probably received\r\ninstructions to watch you like a lynx? Do you imagine that your\r\nblameless past is a sufficient safeguard? I suppose you think that these\r\ndetectives will say to themselves, ‘Now, whom shall we suspect? We must\r\nleave out Spike Mullins, of course, because he naturally wouldn’t dream\r\nof doing such a thing. It can’t be dear old Spike who’s got the stuff.’”\r\n\r\n“But, boss,” interposed Spike brightly. “I ain’t! Dat’s right—I ain’t\r\ngot it. Youse has!”\r\n\r\nJimmy looked at him with reluctant admiration. After all, there was a\r\nbreezy delirium about Spike’s methods of thought which was rather\r\nstimulating when you got used to it. The worst of it was that it did not\r\nfit in with practical, everyday life. Under different conditions—say,\r\nduring convivial evenings at Colney Hatch—he could imagine the Bowery\r\nboy being a charming companion. How pleasantly, for instance, such\r\nremarks as that last would while away the monotony of a padded cell!\r\n\r\n“But, laddie,” he said, with steely affection, “listen once more.\r\nReflect! Ponder! Does it not seep into your consciousness that we are,\r\nas it were, subtly connected in this house in the minds of certain bad\r\npersons? Are we not imagined by Mr. McEachern, for instance, to be\r\nworking hand in hand like brothers? Do you fancy that Mr. McEachern,\r\nchatting with his tame sleuth-hound over their cigars, will have been\r\nreticent on this point? I think not. How do you propose to baffle that\r\ngentlemanly sleuth, Spike, who, I may mention once again, has rarely\r\nmoved more than two yards away from me since his arrival?”\r\n\r\nAn involuntary chuckle escaped Spike.\r\n\r\n“Sure, boss, dat’s all right!”\r\n\r\n“All right, is it? Well, well! What makes you think it is all right?”\r\n\r\n“Why, say, boss, dose sleuts is out of business.” A merry grin split his\r\nface. “It’s funny, boss! Gee, it’s got a circus skinned! Listen! Deyse\r\nbin an’ arrest each other.”\r\n\r\nJimmy moodily revised his former view. Even in Colney Hatch this sort of\r\nthing would be coldly received. Genius must ever walk alone. Spike would\r\nhave to get along without any hope of meeting a kindred spirit, a\r\nfellow-being in tune with his brain-processes.\r\n\r\n“Dat’s right,” chuckled Spike. “Leastways, it ain’t.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Jimmy soothingly. “I quite understand.”\r\n\r\n“It’s dis way, boss. One of dem has bin an’ arrest de odder mug. Dey had\r\na scrap, each t’inking de odder guy was after de jools, an’ not knowin’\r\ndey was bote sleuts, an’ now one of dem’s bin an’ taken de odder off,\r\nan’”—there were tears of innocent joy in his eyes—“an’ locked him into\r\nde coal-cellar.”\r\n\r\n“What on earth do you mean?”\r\n\r\nSpike giggled helplessly.\r\n\r\n“Listen, boss! It’s dis way. Gee, it beat de band. When it’s all dark,\r\n’cos of de storm comin’ on, I’m in de dressin’-room chasin’ around for\r\nde jool-box, and just as I gets a line on it—gee!— I hears a footstep\r\ncoming down de passage, very soft, straight for de door. Was I to de\r\nbad? Dat’s right. I says to meself, ‘Here’s one of de sleut guys what’s\r\nbin and got wise to me, an’ he’s comin’ in to put de grip on me,’ so I\r\ngets up quick, an’ I hides behind a coitain. Dere’s a coitain at de side\r\nof de room. Dere’s dude suits an t’ings hangin’ behind it. I chases\r\nmeself in dere, and stands waitin’ for de sleut to come in, ’cos den,\r\nyou see, I’m goin’ to try an’ get busy before he can see who I am—it’s\r\npretty dark ’cos of de storm—an’ jolt him one on de point of de jaw, an’\r\nden, while he’s down an’ out, chase meself fer de soivants’ hall.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Well, dis guy, he gets to de door and opens it, and I’m just gettin’\r\nready for one sudden boist of speed when dere jumps out from de room on\r\nde odder side de passage—you know de room—anodder guy, an’ gets de rapid\r\nstrangleholt on de foist mug. Say, wouldn’t dat make youse glad you\r\nhadn’t gone to de circus? Honest, it was better dan Coney Island.”\r\n\r\n“Go on. What happened then?”\r\n\r\n“Day falls to scrappin’ good and hard. Dey couldn’t see me, an’ I\r\ncouldn’t see dem, but I could hear dem bumpin’ about and sluggin’ each\r\nodder to beat de band. And by and by one of de mugs puts de odder mug to\r\nde bad, so dat he goes down and takes de count; and den I hears a click.\r\nAnd I know what dat is. It’s one of de gazebos has put de irons on de\r\nodder gazebo.”\r\n\r\n“Call them A and B,” suggested Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Den I hears him—de foist mug—strike a light, ’cos it’s dark dere ’cos\r\nof de storm, an’ den he says, ‘Got youse, have I?’ he says. ‘I’ve had my\r\neye on you, t’inkin’ youse was up to somet’ing of dis kind. I’ve bin\r\nwatchin’ youse!’ I knew de voice. It’s dat mug what calls himself Sir\r\nTummas’s vally. And de odder——”\r\n\r\nJimmy burst into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Don’t, Spike! This is more than man was meant to stand. Do you mean to\r\ntell me that it is my bright, brainy, persevering friend Galer who has\r\nbeen handcuffed and locked in the coal-cellar?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, dat’s right,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s a judgment,” said Jimmy delightedly—“that’s what it is. No man has\r\na right to be such a consummate ass as Galer. It isn’t decent.”\r\n\r\nThere had been moments when McEachern’s faithful employé had filled\r\nJimmy with an odd sort of fury, a kind of hurt pride, almost to the\r\nextent of making him wish that he really could have been the desperado\r\nMcEachern fancied him. Never in his life before had he sat still under a\r\nchallenge, and this espionage had been one. Behind the clumsy watcher he\r\nhad seen always the self-satisfied figure of McEachern. If there had\r\nbeen anything subtle about the man from Dodson’s he could have forgiven\r\nhim; but there was not. Years of practice had left Spike with a sort of\r\nsixth sense as regarded representatives of the law. He could pierce the\r\nmost cunning disguise. But in the case of Galer even Jimmy could detect\r\nthe detective.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” he said.\r\n\r\nSpike proceeded.\r\n\r\n“Well, de odder mug, de one down and out on de floor wit de irons on——”\r\n\r\n“Galer, in fact,” said Jimmy. “Handsome, dashing Galer!”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Well, he’s too busy catchin’ up wit his breat’ to shoot it back\r\nswift, but after he’s bin doin’ de deep-breathin’ stunt for a while he\r\nsays, ‘You mutt,’ he says, ‘youse is to de bad. You’re made a break, you\r\nhave. Dat’s right. Surest t’ing you know.’ He puts it different, but\r\ndat’s what he means. ‘I’m a sleut,’ he says. ‘Take dese t’ings\r\noff!’—meanin’ de irons. Does de odder mug, de vally gazebo, give him de\r\nglad eye? Not so’s you could notice it. He gives him de merry ha-ha. He\r\nsays dat dat’s de woist tale dat’s ever bin handed to him. ‘Tell it to\r\nSweeney!’ he says. ‘I knows youse. You woims yourself into de house as a\r\nguest, when youse is really after de loidy’s jools.’ At dese crool woids\r\nde odder mug, Galer, gits hot under de collar. ‘I’m a sure ’nough\r\nsleut,’ he says. ‘I blows into dis house at de special request of Mr.\r\nMcEachern, de American gent.’ De odder mug hands him de lemon again.\r\n‘Tell it to de King of Denmark,’ he says. ‘Dis cops de limit. Youse has\r\nenough gall for ten strong men,’ he says. ‘Show me to Mr. McEachern,’\r\nsays Galer. ‘He’ll——crouch,’ is dat it?”\r\n\r\n“Vouch?” suggested Jimmy. “Meaning give the glad hand to.”\r\n\r\n“Dat’s right—vouch. I wondered what he meant at de time. ‘He’ll vouch\r\nfor me,’ he says. Dat puts him all right, he t’inks; but no, he’s still\r\nin Dutch, ’cos de vally mug says, ‘Nix on dat! I ain’t goin’ to chase\r\naround de house wit youse, lookin’ for Mr. McEachern. It’s youse for de\r\ncoal-cellar, me man, an’ we’ll see what youse has to say when I makes me\r\nreport to Sir Tummas.’ ‘Well, dat’s to de good,’ says Galer. ‘Tell Sir\r\nTummas. I’ll explain to him.’ ‘Not me!’ says de vally. ‘Sir Tummas has a\r\nhard evening’s woik before him, jollyin’ along de swells what’s comin’\r\nto see dis stoige-piece dey’re actin’. I ain’t goin’ to worry him till\r\nhe’s good and ready. To de coal-cellar for yours! G’wan!’ and off dey\r\ngoes! And I gets busy again, swipes de jools, and chases meself here.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever heard of poetic justice, Spike?” he asked. “This is it.\r\nBut in this hour of mirth and good will we must not forget——”\r\n\r\nSpike interrupted.\r\n\r\nBeaming with honest pleasure at the enthusiastic reception of his\r\nnarrative, he proceeded to point out the morals that were to be deduced\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\n“So youse see, boss,” he said, “it’s all to de merry. When dey rubbers\r\nfor de jools and finds dem gone, dey’ll t’ink dis Galer guy swiped dem.\r\nDey won’t t’ink of us.”\r\n\r\nJimmy looked at him gravely.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said he. “What a reasoner you are, Spike! Galer was just\r\nopening the door from the outside, by your account, when the valet-man\r\nsprang at him. Naturally they’ll think that he took the jewels,\r\nespecially as they won’t find them on him. A man who can open a locked\r\nsafe through a closed door is just the sort of fellow who would be able\r\nto get rid of the swag neatly while rolling about the floor with the\r\nvalet. His not having the jewels will make the case all the blacker\r\nagainst him. And what will make them still more certain that he is the\r\nthief is that he really is a detective. Spike, you ought to be in some\r\nsort of a home, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe Bowery boy looked disturbed.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t t’ink of dat, boss,” he admitted.\r\n\r\n“Of course not. One can’t think of everything. Now, if you will just\r\nhand me those diamonds, I will put them back where they belong.”\r\n\r\n“Put dem back, boss!”\r\n\r\n“What else would you propose? I’d get you to do it, only I don’t think\r\nputting things back is much in your line.”\r\n\r\nSpike handed over the jewels. The boss was the boss, and what he said\r\nwent. But his demeanour was tragic, telling eloquently of hopes\r\nblighted.\r\n\r\nJimmy took the necklace with something of a thrill. He was a connoisseur\r\nof jewels, and a fine gem affected him much as a fine picture affects\r\nthe artistic. He ran the diamonds through his fingers, then scrutinized\r\nthem again, more closely this time.\r\n\r\nSpike watched him with a slight return of hope. It seemed to him that\r\nthe boss was wavering. Perhaps, now that he had actually handled the\r\njewels, he would find it impossible to give them up. To Spike a diamond\r\nnecklace of cunning workmanship was merely the equivalent of so many\r\n“plunks”; but he knew that there were men, otherwise sane, who valued a\r\njewel for its own sake.\r\n\r\n“It’s a boid of a necklace, boss,” he murmured encouragingly.\r\n\r\n“It is,” said Jimmy. “In its way I’ve never seen anything much better.\r\nSir Thomas will be glad to have it back.”\r\n\r\n“Den you’re going to put it back, boss?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” said Jimmy. “I’ll do it just before the theatricals; there\r\nshould be a chance then. There’s one good thing—this afternoon’s affair\r\nwill have cleared the air of sleuth-hounds a little.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 23 ★\r\n                             _Family Jars_\r\n\r\n\r\nHildebrand Spencer Poyns de Burgh John Hannasyde Coombe-Crombie, twelfth\r\nEarl of Dreever, was feeling like a toad under the harrow. He read the\r\nletter again, but a second perusal made it no better. Very briefly and\r\nclearly Molly had broken off the engagement. She “thought it best”; she\r\nwas “afraid it could make neither of us happy.” All very true, thought\r\nhis lordship miserably. His sentiments to a T. At the proper time\r\nnothing he would have liked better. But why seize for this declaration\r\nthe precise moment when he was intending, on the strength of the\r\nengagement, to separate his uncle from twenty pounds? That was what\r\nrankled. That Molly could have no knowledge of his sad condition did not\r\noccur to him. He had a sort of feeling that she ought to have known by\r\ninstinct. Nature, as has been pointed out, had equipped Hildebrand\r\nSpencer Poyns de Burgh with one of those cheap-substitute minds. What\r\npassed for brain in him was to genuine grey matter what just-as-good\r\nimitation coffee is to real Mocha. In moments of emotion and mental\r\ndistress, consequently, his reasoning, like Spike’s, was apt to be in a\r\nclass of its own.\r\n\r\nHe read the letter for the third time, and a gentle perspiration began\r\nto form on his forehead. This was awful. The presumable jubilation of\r\nKatie, the penniless ripper of the Savoy, when he should present himself\r\nto her a free man, did not enter into the mental picture that was\r\nunfolding before him. She was too remote. Between him and her lay the\r\nfearsome figure of Sir Thomas, rampant, filling the entire horizon. Nor\r\nis this to be wondered at. There was probably a brief space during which\r\nPerseus, concentrating his gaze upon the monster, did not see Andromeda;\r\nand a knight of the Middle Ages, jousting in the gentlemen’s singles for\r\na smile from his lady, rarely allowed the thought of that smile to\r\noccupy his whole mind at the moment when his boiler-plated antagonist\r\nwas descending upon him in the wake of a sharp spear.\r\n\r\nSo with Spennie Dreever. Bright eyes might shine for him when all was\r\nover, but in the meantime what seemed to him more important was that\r\nbulging eyes would glare.\r\n\r\nIf only this had happened later—even a day later! The reckless\r\nimpulsiveness of the modern girl had undone him. How was he to pay\r\nHargate his money? Hargate must be paid—that was certain; no other\r\ncourse was possible. Lord Dreever’s was not one of those natures which\r\nfret restlessly under debt. During his early career at college he had\r\nendeared himself to the local tradesmen by the magnitude of the\r\nliabilities he had contracted with them. It was not the being in debt\r\nthat he minded, it was the consequences. Hargate, he felt instinctively,\r\nwas of a revengeful nature. He had given Hargate twenty pounds’ worth of\r\nsnubbing, and the latter had presented the bill. If it were not paid\r\nthings would happen. Hargate and he were members of the same club, and a\r\nmember of a club who loses money at cards to a fellow-member and fails\r\nto settle up does not make himself popular with the committee.\r\n\r\nHe must get the money—there was no avoiding that conclusion—but how?\r\n\r\nFinancially, his lordship was like a fallen country with a glorious\r\nhistory. There had been a time, during his first two years at college,\r\nwhen he had revelled in the luxury of a handsome allowance. This was the\r\ngolden age, when Sir Thomas Blunt, being, so to speak, new to the job,\r\nand feeling that, having reached the best circles, he must live up to\r\nthem, had scattered largesse lavishly. For two years after his marriage\r\nwith Lady Julia he had maintained this admirable standard, crushing his\r\nnatural parsimony. He had regarded the money so spent as capital sunk in\r\nan investment. By the end of the second year he had found his feet, and\r\nbegan to look about him for ways of retrenchment. His lordship’s\r\nallowance was an obvious way. He had not to wait long for an excuse for\r\nannihilating it. There is a game called poker, at which a man without\r\nmuch control over his features may exceed the limits of the handsomest\r\nallowance. His lordship’s face during a game of poker was like the\r\nsurface of some quiet pond, ruffled by every breeze. The blank despair\r\nof his expression when he held bad cards made bluffing expensive. The\r\nhonest joy that bubbled over in his eyes when his hand was good acted as\r\nan efficient danger-signal to his grateful opponents. Two weeks of poker\r\nhad led to his writing to his uncle a distressed but confident request\r\nfor more funds; and the avuncular foot had come down with a joyous bang.\r\nTaking his stand on the evils of gambling, Sir Thomas had changed the\r\nconditions of the money-market for his nephew with a thoroughness that\r\neffectually prevented the possibility of his being again led astray by\r\nthe fascinations of poker. The allowance vanished absolutely, and in its\r\nplace there came into being an arrangement. By this his lordship was to\r\nhave whatever money he wished for, but he must ask for it, and state why\r\nit was needed. If the request were reasonable, the cash would be\r\nforthcoming; if preposterous, it would not. The flaw in the scheme, from\r\nhis lordship’s point of view, was the difference of opinion which can\r\nexist in the minds of two men as to what the words reasonable and\r\npreposterous may be taken to mean.\r\n\r\nTwenty pounds, for instance, would, in the lexicon of Sir Thomas Blunt,\r\nbe perfectly reasonable for the current expenses of a man engaged to\r\nMolly McEachern, but preposterous for one to whom she had declined to\r\nremain engaged. It is these subtle shades of meaning which make the\r\nEnglish language so full of pitfalls for the foreigner.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was his lordship in his meditations that it was not till a\r\nvoice spoke at his elbow that he was aware that Sir Thomas himself was\r\nstanding by his side.\r\n\r\n“Well, Spennie, my boy,” said the knight. “Time to dress for dinner, I\r\nthink. Eh? Eh?”\r\n\r\nHe was plainly in high good-humour. The thought of the distinguished\r\ncompany he was to entertain that night had changed him temporarily, as\r\nwith some wave of a fairy wand, into a thing of joviality and\r\nbenevolence. One could almost hear the milk of human kindness gurgling\r\nand splashing within him. The irony of Fate! To-night—such was his\r\nmood—a dutiful nephew could have come and felt his pockets and helped\r\nhimself—if circumstances had been different. Oh, woman, woman, how you\r\nbar us from Paradise!\r\n\r\nHis lordship gurgled a wordless reply, thrusting the fateful letter\r\nhastily into his pocket. He would break the news anon—soon. Not\r\nyet—later on; in fact, anon.\r\n\r\n“Up in your part, my boy?” continued Sir Thomas. “You mustn’t spoil the\r\nplay by forgetting your lines. That wouldn’t do.”\r\n\r\nHis eye was caught by the envelope which Spennie had dropped. A\r\nmomentary relapse from the jovial and benevolent was the result. His\r\nfussy little soul abhorred small untidinesses.\r\n\r\n“Dear me,” he said, stooping, “I wish people would not drop paper about\r\nthe house. I cannot endure a litter.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if somebody had been playing hare-and-hounds and scattering\r\nthe scent on the stairs. This sort of thing sometimes made him regret\r\nthe old days. In Blunt’s Stores Rule 67 imposed a fine of half a crown\r\non employés convicted of paper-dropping.\r\n\r\n“I——” began his lordship.\r\n\r\n“Why”—Sir Thomas straightened himself—“it’s addressed to you!”\r\n\r\n“I was just going to pick it up. It’s—er—there was a note in it.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Blunt gazed at the envelope again. Joviality and benevolence\r\nresumed their thrones.\r\n\r\n“And the feminine handwriting,” he chuckled. He eyed the limp peer\r\nalmost roguishly. “I see, I see,” he said. “Very charming. Quite\r\ndelightful! Girls must have their little romance. I suppose you two\r\nyoung people are exchanging love-letters all day? Delightful—quite\r\ndelightful! Don’t look as if you were ashamed of it, my boy. I like it.\r\nI think it’s charming.”\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this was the opening. Beyond a question his lordship should\r\nhave said at this point, “Uncle, I cannot tell a lie. I cannot even\r\nallow myself to see you labouring under a delusion which a word from me\r\ncan remove. The contents of this note are not what you suppose. They run\r\nas follows——”\r\n\r\nWhat he did say was, “Uncle, can you let me have twenty pounds?”\r\n\r\nThose were his amazing words. They slipped out. He could not stop them.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was taken aback for an instant, but not seriously. He started\r\nas might a man who, stroking a cat, receives a sudden but trifling\r\nscratch.\r\n\r\n“Twenty pounds, eh?” he said reflectively.\r\n\r\nThen the milk of human kindness swept over displeasure like a tidal\r\nwave. This was a night for rich gifts to the deserving.\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly, my boy, certainly. Do you want it at once?”\r\n\r\nHis lordship replied that he did, please; and he had seldom said a thing\r\nmore fervently.\r\n\r\n“Well, well. We’ll see what we can do. Come with me.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way to his dressing-room. Like nearly all the rooms at the\r\ncastle, it was large. One wall was completely hidden by the curtain\r\nbehind which Spike had taken refuge that afternoon.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas went to the dressing-table and unlocked a small drawer.\r\n\r\n“Twenty, you said? Five—ten—fifteen—here you are, my boy.”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever muttered his thanks. Sir Thomas accepted the guttural\r\nacknowledgment with a friendly pat on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I like a little touch like that,” he said.\r\n\r\nHis lordship looked startled.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t have touched you,” he began, “if it hadn’t been——”\r\n\r\n“A little touch like that letter-writing,” Sir Thomas went on. “It shows\r\na warm heart. She is a warm-hearted girl, Spennie—a charming,\r\nwarm-hearted girl! You’re uncommonly lucky, my boy.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship, crackling the four bank-notes, silently agreed with him.\r\n\r\n“But come, I must be dressing. Dear me, it is very late. We shall have\r\nto hurry. By the way, my boy, I shall take the opportunity of making a\r\npublic announcement of the engagement to-night. It will be a capital\r\noccasion for it, I think, perhaps, at the conclusion of the theatricals,\r\na little speech—something quite impromptu and informal, just asking them\r\nto wish you happiness, and so on. I like the idea. There is an old-world\r\nair about it that appeals to me. Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to the dressing-table and removed his collar.\r\n\r\n“Well, run along, my boy,” he said. “You must not be late.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship tottered from the room. He did quite an unprecedented\r\namount of thinking as he hurried into his evening clothes; but the\r\nthought which occurred most frequently was that, whatever happened, all\r\nwas well in one way, at any rate. He had the twenty pounds. There would\r\nbe something colossal in the shape of disturbances when his uncle\r\nlearned the truth. It would be the biggest thing since the San Francisco\r\nearthquake. But what of it? He had the money.\r\n\r\nHe slipped it into his waistcoat pocket. He would take it down with him,\r\nand pay Hargate directly after dinner.\r\n\r\nHe left the room. The flutter of a skirt caught his eye as he reached\r\nthe landing. A girl was coming down the corridor on the other side. He\r\nwaited at the head of the stairs to let her go down before him. As she\r\ncame on to the landing he saw that it was Molly.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was an awkward pause.\r\n\r\n“Er—I got your note,” said his lordship.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, and then burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“You know you don’t mind the least little bit,” she said—“not a scrap.\r\nNow, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t make excuses. Do you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s like this, you see. I——”\r\n\r\nHe caught her eye. Next moment they were laughing together.\r\n\r\n“No; but look here, you know,” said his lordship. “What I mean is, it\r\nisn’t that I don’t—I mean, look here, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t\r\nbe the best of pals.”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course there isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“No, really, I say? That’s ripping. Shake hands on it.”\r\n\r\nThey clasped hands; and it was in this affecting attitude that Sir\r\nThomas Blunt, bustling downstairs, discovered them.\r\n\r\n“Aha!” he cried archly. “Well, well, well! But don’t mind me, don’t mind\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nMolly flushed uncomfortably; partly because she disliked Sir Thomas even\r\nwhen he was not arch, and hated him when he was: partly because she felt\r\nfoolish; and principally because she was bewildered. She had not looked\r\nforward to meeting Sir Thomas that night. It was always unpleasant\r\nmeeting him, but it would be more unpleasant than usual after she had\r\nupset the scheme for which he had worked so earnestly. She had wondered\r\nwhether he would be cold and distant or voluble and heated. In her\r\npessimistic moments she had anticipated a long and painful scene. That\r\nhe should be behaving like this was not very much short of a miracle.\r\nShe could not understand it.\r\n\r\nA glance at Lord Dreever enlightened her. That miserable creature was\r\nwearing the air of a timid child about to pull a large cracker. He\r\nseemed to be bracing himself up for an explosion.\r\n\r\nShe pitied him sincerely. So he had not told his uncle the news yet! Of\r\ncourse, he had scarcely had time. Saunders must have given him the note\r\nas he was going up to dress.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no use in prolonging the agony. Sir Thomas must be\r\ntold sooner or later. She was glad of the chance to tell him herself.\r\nShe would be able to explain that it was all her doing.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid there’s a mistake,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking it over, and I came to the conclusion that we\r\nweren’t——Well, I broke off the engagement.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas’s always prominent eyes protruded still farther. The colour\r\nof his florid face deepened. Suddenly he chuckled.\r\n\r\nMolly looked at him amazed. Sir Thomas was indeed behaving unexpectedly\r\nto-night.\r\n\r\n“I see it,” he wheezed. “You’re having a joke with me! So this is what\r\nyou were hatching as I came downstairs! Don’t tell me! If you had really\r\nthrown him over you wouldn’t have been laughing together like that. It’s\r\nno good, my dear. I might have been taken in if I had not seen you, but\r\nI did.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” cried Molly. “You’re wrong—you’re quite wrong. When you saw us\r\nwe were just agreeing that we should be very good friends—that was all.\r\nI broke off the engagement before that. I——”\r\n\r\nShe was aware that his lordship had emitted a hollow croak, but she took\r\nit as his method of endorsing her statement—not as a warning.\r\n\r\n“I wrote Lord Dreever a note this evening,” she went on, “telling him\r\nthat I couldn’t possibly——”\r\n\r\nShe broke off in alarm. With the beginning of her last speech Sir Thomas\r\nhad begun to swell, until now he looked as if he were in imminent danger\r\nof bursting. His face was purple. To Molly’s lively imagination his eyes\r\nappeared to move slowly out of his head, like a snail’s. From the back\r\nof his throat came strange noises.\r\n\r\n“S-s-so——” he stammered.\r\n\r\nHe gulped and tried again.\r\n\r\n“So this,” he said, “so this—so that was what was in that letter, eh?”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever smiled weakly.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” yelled Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\nHis lordship started convulsively.\r\n\r\n“Er—yes,” he said. “Yes, yes—that was it, don’t you know!”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas eyed him with a baleful stare. Molly looked from one to the\r\nother in bewilderment.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which Sir Thomas seemed partially to recover\r\ncommand of himself. Doubts as to the propriety of a family row in\r\nmid-stairs appeared to occur to him. He moved forward.\r\n\r\n“Come with me,” he said, with awful curtness.\r\n\r\nHis lordship followed bonelessly. Molly watched them go, and wondered\r\nmore than ever. There was something behind this. It was not merely the\r\nbreaking-off of the engagement that had roused Sir Thomas. He was not a\r\njust man, but he was just enough to be able to see that the blame was\r\nnot Lord Dreever’s. There had been something more. She was puzzled.\r\n\r\nIn the hall Saunders was standing, weapon in hand, about to beat the\r\ngong.\r\n\r\n“Not yet!” snapped Sir Thomas. “Wait!”\r\n\r\nDinner had been ordered especially early that night because of the\r\ntheatricals. The necessity for strict punctuality had been straitly\r\nenjoined upon Saunders. At some inconvenience he had ensured strict\r\npunctuality. And now—— But we all have our cross to bear in this world.\r\nSaunders bowed with dignified resignation.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas led the way into his study.\r\n\r\n“Be so good as to close the door,” he said.\r\n\r\nHis lordship was so good.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas backed to the mantelpiece and stood there in the attitude\r\nwhich for generations has been sacred to the elderly Briton—feet well\r\napart, hands clasped beneath his coat tails. His stare raked Lord\r\nDreever like a searchlight.\r\n\r\n“Now, sir!” he said.\r\n\r\nHis lordship wilted before his gaze.\r\n\r\n“The fact is, uncle——”\r\n\r\n“Never mind the facts. I know them! What I require is an explanation.”\r\n\r\nHe spread his feet farther apart. The years had rolled back, and he was\r\nplain Thomas Blunt again, of Blunt’s Stores, dealing with an erring\r\nemployé.\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean,” he went on. “I am not referring to the\r\nbreaking-off of the engagement. What I insist upon learning is your\r\nreason for failing to inform me earlier of the contents of that letter.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship said that somehow, don’t you know, there didn’t seem to be\r\na chance, you know. He had several times been on the point—but—well,\r\nsomehow—— Well, that’s how it was.\r\n\r\n“No chance?” cried Sir Thomas. “Indeed! Why did you require that money I\r\ngave you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh—er—I wanted it for something.”\r\n\r\n“Very possibly. For what?”\r\n\r\n“I—the fact is, I owed it to a fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! How did you come to owe it?”\r\n\r\nHis lordship shuffled.\r\n\r\n“You have been gambling,” boomed Sir Thomas. “Am I right?”\r\n\r\n“No, no! I say, no, no. It wasn’t gambling—it was a game of skill. We\r\nwere playing piquet.”\r\n\r\n“Kindly refrain from quibbling. You lost this money at cards, then, as I\r\nsupposed. Just so.”\r\n\r\nHe widened the space between his feet. He intensified his glare. He\r\nmight have been posing to an illustrator of _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ for\r\na picture of “Apollyon straddling right across the way”.\r\n\r\n“So,” he said, “you deliberately concealed from me the contents of that\r\nletter, in order that you might extract money from me under false\r\npretences? Don’t speak!” (his lordship had gurgled). “You did! Your\r\nbehaviour was that of a—of a——”\r\n\r\nThere was a very fair selection of evil-doers in all branches of\r\nbusiness from which to choose. He gave the preference to the race-track.\r\n\r\n“Of a common welsher,” he concluded. “But I won’t put up with it. No;\r\nnot for an instant. I insist upon you returning that money to me here\r\nand now. If you have not got it with you, go and fetch it.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship’s face betrayed the deepest consternation. He had been\r\nprepared for much, but not for this. That he would have to undergo what,\r\nin his school-days, he would have called a “jaw” was inevitable, and he\r\nhad been ready to go through with it. It might hurt his feelings,\r\npossibly, but it would leave his purse intact. A ghastly development of\r\nthis kind he had not foreseen.\r\n\r\n“But, I say, uncle!” he bleated.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas silenced him with a grand gesture.\r\n\r\nRuefully his lordship produced his little all. Sir Thomas took it with a\r\nsnort and went to the door.\r\n\r\nSaunders was still brooding statuesquely over the gong.\r\n\r\n“Sound it!” said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\nSaunders obeyed him with the air of an unleashed hound.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Sir Thomas, “go to my dressing-room and place these\r\nnotes in the small drawer of the table.”\r\n\r\nThe butler’s calm, expressionless, yet withal observant eye took in at a\r\nglance the signs of trouble. Neither the inflated air of Sir Thomas nor\r\nthe punctured-balloon bearing of Lord Dreever escaped him.\r\n\r\n“Something hup,” he said to his immortal soul as he moved upstairs.\r\n“Been a fair old, rare old row, seems to me.”\r\n\r\nHe reserved his more polished periods for use in public. In conversation\r\nwith his immortal soul he was wont to unbend somewhat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 24 ★\r\n                         _The Treasure-Seeker_\r\n\r\n\r\nGloom wrapped his lordship about during dinner as with a garment. He\r\nowed twenty pounds; his assets amounted to seven shillings and\r\nfourpence. He thought, and thought again. Quite an intellectual pallor\r\nbegan to appear on his normally pink cheeks. Saunders silently\r\nsympathetic—he hated Sir Thomas as an interloper, and entertained for\r\nhis lordship, under whose father also he had served, a sort of paternal\r\nfondness—was ever at his elbow with the magic bottle; and to Spennie,\r\nemptying and re-emptying his glass almost mechanically, wine, the\r\nhealer, brought an idea. To obtain twenty pounds from any one person of\r\nhis acquaintance was impossible; to divide the twenty by four and\r\npersuade a generous quartet to contribute five pounds apiece was more\r\nfeasible.\r\n\r\nHope began to stir within him again.\r\n\r\nImmediately after dinner he began to flit about the castle like a family\r\nspectre of active habits. The first person he met was Charteris.\r\n\r\n“Halloa, Spennie!” said Charteris. “I wanted to see you. It is currently\r\nreported that you are in love. At dinner you looked as if you had\r\ninfluenza. What’s your trouble? For goodness’ sake bear up until the\r\nshow’s over. Don’t go swooning on the stage, or anything. Do you know\r\nyour lines?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said his lordship eagerly, “it’s this way. I happen to\r\nwant—— Can you lend me a fiver?”\r\n\r\n“All I have in the world at this moment,” said Charteris, “is eleven\r\nshillings and a postage-stamp. If the stamp would be of any use to you\r\nas a start——No? You know, it’s from small beginnings like that great\r\nfortunes are amassed. However——”\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Lord Dreever had resumed his hunt.\r\n\r\nThe path of the borrower is a thorny one, especially if, as in the case\r\nof Spennie, his reputation as a payer-back is not of the best.\r\n\r\nSpennie, in his time, had extracted small loans from most of his male\r\nacquaintances, rarely repaying the same. He had a tendency to forget\r\nthat he had borrowed half-a-crown here to pay a cab fare and ten\r\nshillings there to settle up for a dinner; and his memory was not much\r\nmore retentive of larger sums. This made his friends somewhat wary. The\r\nconsequence was that the great treasure-hunt was a failure from start to\r\nfinish. He got friendly smiles, he got honeyed apologies, he got earnest\r\nassurances of goodwill; but he got no money, except from Jimmy Pitt.\r\n\r\nHe had approached Jimmy in the early stages of the hunt and Jimmy, being\r\nin the mood when he would have lent anything to anybody, yielded the\r\nrequired five pounds without a murmur.\r\n\r\nBut what was five pounds? The garment of gloom and the intellectual\r\npallor were once more prominent when his lordship repaired to his room\r\nto don the loud tweeds which, as Lord Herbert, he was to wear in the\r\nfirst act.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal to be said against stealing, as a habit; but it\r\ncannot be denied that, in certain circumstances, it offers an admirable\r\nsolution of a financial difficulty, and, if the penalties were not so\r\nexceedingly unpleasant, it is probable that it would become far more\r\nfashionable than it is.\r\n\r\nHis lordship’s mind did not turn immediately to this outlet from his\r\nembarrassment. He had never stolen before, and it did not occur to him\r\ndirectly to do so now. There is a conservative strain in all of us. But\r\ngradually, as it was borne in upon him that it was the only course\r\npossible, unless he were to grovel before Hargate on the morrow and ask\r\nfor time to pay—an unthinkable alternative—he found himself\r\ncontemplating the possibility of having to secure the money by unlawful\r\nmeans. By the time he had finished his theatrical toilet, he had\r\ndefinitely decided that this was the only thing to be done.\r\n\r\nHis plan was simple. He knew where the money was—in the dressing-table\r\nin Sir Thomas’s room. He had heard Saunders instructed to put it there.\r\nWhat could be easier than to go and get it? Everything was in his\r\nfavour. Sir Thomas would be downstairs receiving his guests. The coast\r\nwould be clear. Why, it was like finding the money.\r\n\r\nBesides, he reflected, as he worked his way through a bottle of Mumm\r\nwhich he had had the forethought to abstract from the supper-table as a\r\nnerve-steadier, it was not really stealing. Dash it all, the man had\r\ngiven him the money! It was his own! He had half a mind—he poured\r\nhimself out another glass of the elixir—to give Sir Thomas a jolly good\r\ntalking to into the bargain. Yes, dash it all!\r\n\r\nHe pushed on his cuffs fiercely. The British lion was roused.\r\n\r\nA man’s first crime is, as a rule, a shockingly amateurish affair. Now\r\nand then, it is true, we find beginners forging with the accuracy of old\r\nhands or breaking into houses with the finish of experts. But these are\r\nisolated cases. The average tyro lacks generalship altogether. Spennie\r\nDreever may be cited as a typical novice. It did not strike him that\r\ninquiries might be instituted by Sir Thomas when he found the money\r\ngone, and that suspicion might conceivably fall upon himself. Courage\r\nmay be born of champagne, but rarely prudence.\r\n\r\nThe theatricals began at half-past eight with a duologue. The audience\r\nhad been hustled into their seats, happier than is usual in such\r\ncircumstances, owing to the rumour which had been circulated that the\r\nproceedings were to terminate with an informal dance. The castle was\r\nsingularly well constructed for such a purpose. There was plenty of room\r\nand a sufficiency of retreat for those who sat out, in addition to a\r\nconservatory large enough to have married off half the couples in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSpennie’s idea had been to establish an alibi by mingling with the\r\nthrong for a few minutes, and then to get through his burglarious\r\nspeciality during the duologue, when his absence would not be noticed.\r\nIt might be that if he disappeared later in the evening people would\r\nwonder what had become of him.\r\n\r\nHe lurked about till the last of the audience had taken their seats. As\r\nhe was moving off through the hall a hand fell upon his shoulder.\r\nConscience makes cowards of us all. Spennie bit his tongue and leaped\r\nthree inches into the air.\r\n\r\n“Halloa, Charteris!” he said gaspingly.\r\n\r\nCharteris appeared to be in a somewhat overwrought condition. Rehearsals\r\nhad turned him into a pessimist, and now that the actual moment of\r\nproduction had arrived his nerves were in a thoroughly jumpy condition,\r\nespecially as the duologue was to begin in two minutes and the obliging\r\nperson who had undertaken to prompt had disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Spennie,” said Charteris, “where are you off to?”\r\n\r\n“What—what do you mean? I was just going upstairs.”\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t. You’ve got to come and prompt. That fellow Blake has\r\nvanished. I’ll wring his neck! Come along!”\r\n\r\nSpennie went reluctantly. Half-way through the duologue the official\r\nprompter returned, with the remark that he had been having a bit of a\r\nsmoke on the terrace and that his watch had gone wrong. Leaving him to\r\ndiscuss the point with Charteris, Spennie slipped quietly away.\r\n\r\nThe delay, however, had had the effect of counteracting the uplifting\r\neffects of the Mumm. The British lion required a fresh fillip. He went\r\nto his room to administer it. By the time he emerged he was feeling just\r\nright for the task in hand. A momentary doubt occurred to him whether it\r\nwould not be a good thing to go down and pull Sir Thomas’s nose as a\r\npreliminary to the proceedings; but he put the temptation aside.\r\nBusiness before pleasure.\r\n\r\nWith a jaunty, if somewhat unsteady, step he climbed the stairs to the\r\nfloor above, and made his way down the corridor to Sir Thomas’s room. He\r\nswitched on the light and went to the dressing-table. The drawer was\r\nlocked, but in his present mood Spennie, like Love, laughed at\r\nlocksmiths. He grasped the handle and threw his weight into a sudden\r\ntug. The drawer came out with a report like a pistol-shot.\r\n\r\n“There!” said his lordship, wagging his head severely.\r\n\r\nIn the drawer lay the four bank-notes. The sight of them brought back\r\nhis grievances with a rush. He would teach Sir Thomas to treat him like\r\na kid. He would show him!\r\n\r\nHe was removing the notes, frowning fiercely the while, when he heard a\r\ncry of surprise from behind him.\r\n\r\nHe turned, to see Molly. She wore the costume of a stage milkmaid, and\r\nher eyes were round with wonder. Leaving her room a few moments earlier,\r\nafter dressing for her part, she had almost reached the end of the\r\ncorridor that led to the landing when she observed his lordship, flashed\r\nof face and moving like some restive charger, come curveting out of his\r\nbedroom in a dazzling suit of tweeds and make his way upstairs. Ever\r\nsince their mutual encounter with Sir Thomas before dinner she had been\r\nhoping for a chance of seeing him alone. She had not failed to notice\r\nhis depression during the meal, and her good little heart had been\r\ntroubled by the thought that she must have been responsible for it. She\r\nknew that for some reason what she had said about the letter had brought\r\nhis lordship into his uncle’s bad books, and she wanted to find him and\r\nsay she was sorry.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, she had followed him. His lordship, still in the war-horse\r\nvein, had made the pace upstairs too hot, and had disappeared while she\r\nwas still half-way up. She had arrived at the top just in time to see\r\nhim turn down the passage into Sir Thomas’s dressing-room. She could not\r\nthink what his object might be. She knew that Sir Thomas was downstairs,\r\nso it could not be with the idea of a chat with him that Spennie was\r\nseeking the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nFaint, yet pursuing, she followed on his trail, and arrived in the\r\ndoorway just as the pistol-report of the burst lock rang out.\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at him blankly. He was holding a drawer in one hand.\r\nWhy, she could not imagine.\r\n\r\n“Lord Dreever!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe sombre determination of his lordship’s face melted into a twisted\r\nbut kindly smile.\r\n\r\n“Good!” he said, perhaps a trifle thickly. “Good! Glad you’ve come—we’re\r\npals—you said so—on stairs—b’fore dinner. Very glad you’ve come. Won’t\r\nyou sit down?”\r\n\r\nHe waved the drawer benevolently, by way of making her free of the room.\r\nThe movement disturbed one of the bank-notes, which fluttered in Molly’s\r\ndirection and fell at her feet.\r\n\r\nShe stooped and picked it up. When she saw what it was her bewilderment\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n“But—but——” she said.\r\n\r\nHis lordship beamed upon her with a pebble-beached smile of\r\nindescribable goodwill.\r\n\r\n“Sit down,” he urged. “We’re pals—no quol with you—you’re good friend.\r\nQuol—Uncle Thomas.”\r\n\r\n“But, Lord Dreever, what are you doing? What was that noise I heard?”\r\n\r\n“Opening drawer,” said his lordship affably.\r\n\r\n“But——” She looked again at what she had in her hand. “But this is a\r\nfive pound note.”\r\n\r\n“Five pound note,” said his lordship—“quite right. Three more of them in\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nStill she could not understand.\r\n\r\n“But—— Were you—stealing them?”\r\n\r\nHis lordship drew himself up.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “No! Not stealing. No.”\r\n\r\n“Then——”\r\n\r\n“Like this: before dinner old boy friendly as you please; couldn’t do\r\nenough for me. Touched him for twenty of the best and got away with it.\r\nSo far all well. Then met you on stairs. You let cat out of bag.”\r\n\r\n“But why? Surely——”\r\n\r\nHis lordship gave the drawer a dignified wave.\r\n\r\n“Not blaming you,” he said magnanimously. “Not your fault—misfortune.\r\nYou didn’t know—about letter.”\r\n\r\n“About the letter?” said Molly. “Yes; what was the trouble about the\r\nletter? I knew something was wrong directly I had said that I wrote it.”\r\n\r\n“Trouble was,” said his lordship, “that old boy thought it was love\r\nletter. Didn’t undeceive him.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t tell him? Why?”\r\n\r\nHis lordship raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Wanted touch him twenty of the best,” he explained simply.\r\n\r\nFor the life of her Molly could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n“Don’t laugh,” protested his lordship, wounded. “No joke—serious—honour\r\nat stake.”\r\n\r\nHe removed the three notes and replaced the drawer.\r\n\r\n“Honour of the Dreevers!” he added, pocketing the money.\r\n\r\n“But, Lord Dreever!” she cried. “You can’t! You mustn’t! You can’t be\r\ngoing, really, to take that money? It’s stealing! It isn’t yours!”\r\n\r\nHis lordship wagged a forefinger very solemnly at her.\r\n\r\n“That,” he said, “is where you make error. Mine! Old boy gave them to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Gave them to you! Then why did you break open the drawer?”\r\n\r\n“Old boy took them back again, when he found out about letter.”\r\n\r\n“Then they don’t belong to you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Error! They do. Moral right.”\r\n\r\nMolly wrinkled her forehead in her agitation. Men of Lord Dreever’s type\r\nappeal to the motherly instinct of women. As a man his lordship was a\r\nnegligible quantity—he did not count; but as a wilful child, to be kept\r\nout of trouble, he had a claim on Molly.\r\n\r\nShe spoke soothingly.\r\n\r\n“But, Lord Dreever——” she began.\r\n\r\n“Call me Spennie,” he urged. “We’re pals. You said so—on stairs.\r\nEverybody calls me Spennie, even Uncle Thomas. I’m going to pull his\r\nnose,” he broke off suddenly, as one recollecting a forgotten\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\n“Spennie, then,” said Molly. “You mustn’t, Spennie. You mustn’t, really.\r\nYou——”\r\n\r\n“You look rippin’ in that dress,” he said irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Spennie, dear. But listen.” She spoke as if she were\r\nhumouring a rebellious infant. “You really mustn’t take that money. You\r\nmust put it back. See, I’m putting this note back. Give me the others,\r\nand I’ll put them in the drawer too. Then we’ll shut the drawer, and\r\nnobody will know.”\r\n\r\nShe took the notes from him, and replaced them in the drawer. He watched\r\nher thoughtfully, as if he were pondering the merits of her arguments.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said suddenly. “No—must have them—moral right! Old boy——”\r\n\r\nShe pushed him gently away.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know,” she said. “I know it’s a shame that you can’t have\r\nthem; but you mustn’t take them. Don’t you see that he would suspect you\r\nthe moment he found they were gone? And then you’d get into trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Something in that,” admitted his lordship.\r\n\r\n“Of course there is, Spennie, dear. I’m so glad you see. There they all\r\nare, safe again in the drawer. Now we can go downstairs again, and——”\r\n\r\nShe stopped. She had closed the door earlier in the proceedings, but her\r\nquick ear caught the sound of a footstep in the passage outside.\r\n\r\n“Quick!” she whispered, taking his hand and darting to the electric\r\nlight switch. “Somebody’s coming. We mustn’t be caught here. They’d see\r\nthe broken drawer, and you’d get into awful trouble. Quick!”\r\n\r\nShe pushed him behind the curtain where the clothes hung, and switched\r\noff the light.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the curtain came the muffled voice of his lordship.\r\n\r\n“It’s Uncle Thomas. I’m coming out. Pull his nose.”\r\n\r\n“Be quiet!”\r\n\r\nShe sprang to the curtain and slipped noiselessly behind it.\r\n\r\n“But, I say——” began his lordship.\r\n\r\n“Hush!”\r\n\r\nShe gripped his arm. He subsided.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps had halted outside the door. Then the handle turned\r\nsoftly. The door opened and closed again with hardly a sound.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps passed on into the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 25 ★\r\n                   _Explanations and an Interruption_\r\n\r\n\r\nJimmy, like Lord Dreever, had been trapped at the beginning of the\r\nduologue, and had not been able to get away till it was nearly over. He\r\nhad been introduced by Lady Julia to an elderly and adhesive baronet,\r\nwho had recently spent ten days in New York, and escape had not been won\r\nwithout a struggle. The baronet, on his return to England had published\r\na book entitled “Modern America and its People” and it was with regard\r\nto the opinions expressed in this volume that he invited Jimmy’s views.\r\nHe had no wish to see the duologue, and it was only after the loss of\r\nmuch precious time that Jimmy was enabled to tear himself away on the\r\nplea of having to dress. He anathematized the authority on “Modern\r\nAmerica and its People” freely as he ran upstairs.\r\n\r\nWhile the duologue was in progress there had been no chance of Sir\r\nThomas taking it into his head to visit his dressing-room. He had been,\r\nas his valet detective had observed to Mr. Galer, too busy jollying\r\namong the swells. It would only be the work of a few moments restoring\r\nthe necklace to its place. But for the tenacity of the elderly baronet\r\nthe thing would have been done by this time. But now there was no\r\nknowing what might not happen—anybody might come along the passage and\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\nHe had one point in his favour: there was no likelihood of the jewels\r\nbeing required by their owner till the conclusion of the theatricals.\r\nThe part which Lady Julia had been persuaded by Charteris to play\r\nmercifully contained no scope for the display of gems.\r\n\r\nBefore going down to dinner he had locked up the necklace in a drawer.\r\nIt was still there, Spike having, apparently, been able to resist the\r\ntemptation of recapturing it. He took it out and went into the corridor.\r\nHe looked up and down it. There was nobody about. He shut his door and\r\nwalked quickly in the direction of the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nHe had provided himself with a lamp from a bicycle belonging to one of\r\nthe grooms. Once inside, having closed the door, he lit this and looked\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nSpike had given him minute directions as to the position of the jewel\r\nbox. He found it without difficulty. To his untrained eye it seemed\r\ntolerably massive and impregnable, but Spike had evidently known how to\r\nopen it without much difficulty. The lid was shut, but it came up\r\nwithout an effort when he tried to raise it, and he saw that the lock\r\nhad been broken.\r\n\r\n“Spike’s coming on!” he said.\r\n\r\nHe was dangling the necklace over the box, preparatory to dropping it\r\nin, when there was a quick rustle at the other side of the room. The\r\ncurtain was plucked aside and Molly came out.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy!” she cried.\r\n\r\nJimmy’s nerves were always in pretty good order, but at the sight of\r\nthis apparition he certainly jumped.\r\n\r\n“Great Scot!” he said.\r\n\r\nThe curtain again became agitated by some unseen force, violently this\r\ntime, and from its depths a plaintive voice made itself heard.\r\n\r\n“Dash it all,” said the voice, “I’ve stuck!”\r\n\r\nThere was another upheaval, and his lordship emerged, his yellow locks\r\nruffled and upstanding, his face crimson.\r\n\r\n“Caught my head in a coat or something,” he explained at large. “Halloa,\r\nPitt!”\r\n\r\nPressed rigid against the wall, Molly had listened with growing\r\nastonishment to the movements on the other side of the curtain. Her\r\nmystification deepened every moment. It seemed to her that the room was\r\nstill in darkness. She could hear the sound of breathing; and then the\r\nlight of the lantern caught her eye. Who could this be, and why had he\r\nnot switched on the electric light?\r\n\r\nShe strained her ears to catch a sound. For a while she heard nothing\r\nexcept the soft breathing. Then came a voice that she knew well; and,\r\nabandoning her hiding-place, she came out into the room, and found Jimmy\r\nstanding with a lamp in his hand over some dark object in the corner of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nIt was a full minute after Jimmy’s first exclamation of surprise before\r\neither of them spoke again. The light of the lamp hurt Molly’s eyes. She\r\nput up a hand to shade them. It seemed to her that they had been\r\nstanding like this for years.\r\n\r\nJimmy had not moved. There was something in his attitude which filled\r\nMolly with a vague fear. In the shadow behind the lamp he looked\r\nshapeless and inhuman.\r\n\r\n“You’re hurting my eyes,” she said at last.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” said Jimmy. “I didn’t think. Is that better?” He turned the\r\nlight from her face. Something in his voice and the apologetic haste\r\nwith which he moved the lamp seemed to relax the strain of the\r\nsituation. The feeling of stunned surprise began to leave her. She found\r\nherself thinking coherently again.\r\n\r\nThe relief was but momentary. Why was Jimmy in the room at that time?\r\nWhy had he a lamp? What had he been doing? The questions shot from her\r\nbrain like sparks from an anvil.\r\n\r\nThe darkness began to tear at her nerves. She felt along the wall for\r\nthe switch and flooded the room with light.\r\n\r\nJimmy laid down the lantern and stood for a moment undecided. He had\r\nconcealed the necklace behind him. Now he brought it forward and dangled\r\nit silently before the eyes of Molly and his lordship. Excellent as were\r\nhis motives for being in that room with the necklace in his hand, he\r\ncould not help feeling, as he met Molly’s startled gaze, quite as guilty\r\nas if his intentions had been quite different.\r\n\r\nHis lordship, having by this time pulled himself together to some\r\nextent, was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n“I say, you know, what ho!” he observed, not without emotion. “What?”\r\n\r\nMolly drew back.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy! You were——. Oh, you can’t have been!”\r\n\r\n“Looks jolly like it!” said his lordship judicially.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t,” said Jimmy. “I was putting them back.”\r\n\r\n“Putting them back?”\r\n\r\n“Pitt, old man,” said his lordship solemnly, “that sounds a bit thin.”\r\n\r\n“Dreever, old man,” said Jimmy, “I know it does. But it’s the truth.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship’s manner became kindly.\r\n\r\n“Now, look here, Pitt, old son,” he said. “There’s nothing to worry\r\nabout—we’re all pals here—you can pitch it straight to us. We won’t give\r\nyou away. We——”\r\n\r\n“Be quiet!” cried Molly. “Jimmy!”\r\n\r\nHer voice was strained; she spoke with an effort; she was suffering\r\ntorments. The words her father had said to her on the terrace were\r\npouring back into her mind. She seemed to hear his voice now, cool and\r\nconfident, warning her against Jimmy, saying that he was crooked. There\r\nwas a curious whirring in her head. Everything in the room was growing\r\nlarge and misty. She heard Lord Dreever begin to say something that\r\nsounded as if some one were speaking at the end of a telephone; and then\r\nshe was aware that Jimmy was holding her in his arms and calling to Lord\r\nDreever to bring water.\r\n\r\n“When a girl goes like that,” said his lordship, with an insufferable\r\nair of omniscience, “you want to cut her——”\r\n\r\n“Come along!” said Jimmy. “Are you going to be a week getting that\r\nwater?”\r\n\r\nHis lordship proceeded to soak a sponge without further parley; but as\r\nhe carried his dripping burden across the room Molly recovered. She\r\ntried weakly to free herself.\r\n\r\nJimmy helped her to a chair. He had dropped the necklace on the floor,\r\nand Lord Dreever nearly trod on it.\r\n\r\n“What ho!” observed his lordship, picking it up. “Go easy with the\r\njewellery!”\r\n\r\nJimmy was bending over Molly. Neither of them seemed to be aware of his\r\nlordship’s presence. Spennie was the sort of person whose existence is\r\napt to be forgotten. Jimmy had had a flash of intuition. For the first\r\ntime it occurred to him that Mr. McEachern might have hinted to Molly\r\nsomething of his own suspicions.\r\n\r\n“Molly, dear,” he said, “it isn’t what you think. I can explain\r\neverything. Do you feel better now? Can you listen? I can explain\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\n“Pitt, old boy,” protested his lordship, “you don’t understand. We\r\naren’t going to give you away. We’re all——”\r\n\r\nJimmy ignored him.\r\n\r\n“Molly, listen,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe sat up.\r\n\r\n“Go on, Jimmy,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t stealing the necklace—I was putting it back. The man who came\r\nto the castle with me, Spike Mullins, took it this afternoon and brought\r\nit to me.”\r\n\r\nSpike Mullins! Molly remembered the name.\r\n\r\n“He thinks I am a crook—a sort of Raffles. It was my fault. I was a\r\nfool. It all began that night in New York when we met at your house. I\r\nhad been to the opening performance of a play called _Love, the\r\nCracksman_—one of those burglar plays.”\r\n\r\n“Jolly good show!” interpolated his lordship chattily. “It was at the\r\nCircle over here. I went twice.”\r\n\r\n“A friend of mine, a man named Mifflin, had been playing the hero in it,\r\nand after the show, at the club, he started in talking about the art of\r\nburglary—he’d been studying it—and I said that anybody could burgle a\r\nhouse. And in another minute it somehow happened that I had made a bet\r\nthat I would do it that night. Heaven knows whether I ever really meant\r\nto; but that same night this man Mullins broke into my flat, and I\r\ncaught him. We got into conversation, and I worked off on him a lot of\r\ntechnical stuff I’d heard from this actor friend of mine, and he jumped\r\nto the conclusion that I was an expert. And then it suddenly occurred to\r\nme that it would be a good joke on Mifflin if I went out with Mullins\r\nand did break into a house. I wasn’t in the mood to think what a fool I\r\nwas at the time. Well, anyway, we went out, and—well, that’s how it all\r\nhappened. And then I met Spike in London, down and out, and brought him\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her anxiously. It did not need his lordship’s owlish\r\nexpression of doubt to tell him how weak his story must sound. He had\r\nfelt it even as he was telling it. He was bound to admit that if ever a\r\nstory rang false in every sentence it was this one.\r\n\r\n“Pitt, old man,” said his lordship, shaking his head, more in sorrow\r\nthan in anger, “it won’t do, old top. What’s the point of putting up any\r\nold yarn like that? Don’t you see, what I mean is, it’s not as if we\r\nminded. Don’t I keep telling you we’re all pals here? I’ve often thought\r\nwhat a jolly good feller old Raffles was—regular sportsman. I don’t\r\nblame a chappie for doing the gentleman burglar touch. Seems to me it’s\r\na dashed sporting——”\r\n\r\nMolly turned on him suddenly, cutting short his views on the ethics of\r\ngentlemanly theft in a blaze of indignation.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” she cried. “Do you think I don’t believe every word\r\nJimmy has said?”\r\n\r\nHis lordship jumped.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t you know, it seemed to me a bit thin. What I mean is——” He\r\nmet Molly’s eye.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well!” he concluded lamely.\r\n\r\nMolly turned to Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy, of course I believe you—I believe every word.”\r\n\r\n“Molly!”\r\n\r\nHis lordship looked on, marvelling. The thought crossed his mind that he\r\nhad lost the ideal wife. A girl who would believe any old yarn a feller\r\ncared to—— If it hadn’t been for Katie—— For a moment he felt almost\r\nsad.\r\n\r\nJimmy and Molly were looking at each other in silence. From the\r\nexpression on their faces his lordship gathered that his existence had\r\nonce more been forgotten. He saw her hold out her hands to Jimmy. It was\r\nembarrassing for a chap! He looked away.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the door opened and closed again, and she had gone.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Jimmy. Jimmy was still apparently unconscious of his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nHis lordship coughed.\r\n\r\n“Pitt, old man——”\r\n\r\n“Halloa!” said Jimmy, coming out of his thoughts with a start. “You\r\nstill here? By the way”—he eyed Lord Dreever curiously—“I never thought\r\nof asking before—what on earth are you doing here? Why were you behind\r\nthe curtain? Were you playing hide and seek?”\r\n\r\nHis lordship was not one of those who invent circumstantial stories\r\neasily on the spur of the moment. He searched rapidly for something that\r\nwould pass muster, then abandoned the hopeless struggle. After all, why\r\nnot be frank? He still believed Jimmy to be of the class of the hero of\r\n_Love, the Cracksman_. There would be no harm in confiding in him. He\r\nwas a good fellow, a kindred soul, and would sympathise.\r\n\r\n“It’s like this,” he said. And, having prefaced his narrative with the\r\nsound remark that he had been a bit of an ass, he gave Jimmy a summary\r\nof recent events.\r\n\r\n“What!” said Jimmy. “You taught Hargate piquet? Why, my dear man, he was\r\nplaying piquet like a professor when you were in short frocks. He’s a\r\nwonder at it.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship stared.\r\n\r\n“How’s that?” he said. “You don’t know him, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I met him in New York at the Strollers’ Club. A pal of mine, an\r\nactor—this fellow Mifflin I mentioned just now—put him up as a guest. He\r\ncoined money at piquet. And there were some pretty useful players in the\r\nplace, too. I don’t wonder you found him a promising pupil.”\r\n\r\n“Then—then—why, dash it! then he’s a bally sharper?”\r\n\r\n“You’re a genius at crisp description,” said Jimmy. “You’ve got him\r\nsummed up to rights first shot.”\r\n\r\n“I shan’t pay him a bally penny.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. If he makes any objection refer him to me.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship’s relief was extreme. The more overpowering effects of the\r\nelixir had passed away, and he saw now what he had not seen in his more\r\nexuberant frame of mind—the cloud of suspicion which must hang over him\r\nwhen the loss of the bank-notes was discovered.\r\n\r\nHe wiped his forehead.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” he said. “That’s something off my mind! By George, I feel\r\nlike a two year old! I say, you’re a dashed good sort, Pitt.”\r\n\r\n“You flatter me,” said Jimmy. “I strive to please.”\r\n\r\n“I say, Pitt, that yarn you told us just now—the bet and all\r\nthat—honestly, you don’t mean to say that was true, was it? I mean—— By\r\nJove! I’ve got an idea.”\r\n\r\n“We live in stirring times!”\r\n\r\n“Did you say your actor pal’s name was Mifflin?” He broke off suddenly\r\nbefore Jimmy could answer. “Great Scot!” he whispered, “what’s that?\r\nGood lord! Somebody’s coming!”\r\n\r\nHe dived behind the curtain like a rabbit. It had only just ceased to\r\nshake when the door opened and Sir Thomas Blunt walked in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 26 ★\r\n                    _Stirring Times for Sir Thomas_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a man whose intentions towards the jewels and their owner were so\r\ninnocent, and even benevolent, Jimmy was in a singularly compromising\r\nposition. It would have been difficult, even under more favourable\r\nconditions, to have explained to Sir Thomas’s satisfaction his presence\r\nin the dressing-room. As things stood it was even harder, for his\r\nlordship’s last action before seeking cover had been to fling the\r\nnecklace from him like a burning coal. For the second time in ten\r\nminutes it had fallen to the carpet, and it was just as Jimmy\r\nstraightened himself after picking it up that Sir Thomas got a full view\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nThe knight stood in the doorway, his face expressing the most lively\r\nastonishment. His bulging eyes were fixed upon the necklace in Jimmy’s\r\nhand. Jimmy could see him struggling to find words to cope with so\r\nspecial a situation, and he felt rather sorry for him. Excitement of\r\nthis kind was bad for a short-necked man of Sir Thomas’s type.\r\n\r\nWith kindly tact he endeavoured to help him out.\r\n\r\n“Good evening,” he said pleasantly.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas stammered. He was gradually nearing speech.\r\n\r\n“What—what—what——” he said.\r\n\r\n“Out with it,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“What——”\r\n\r\n“I knew a man once in South Dakota who stammered,” said Jimmy. “He used\r\nto chew dog-biscuit while he was speaking. It cured him, besides being\r\nnutritious. Another good way is to count ten while you’re thinking what\r\nto say, and then get it out quick.”\r\n\r\n“You—you blackguard!”\r\n\r\nJimmy placed the necklace carefully on the dressing-table. Then he\r\nturned to Sir Thomas, with his hands in the pockets of his coat. Over\r\nthe knight’s head he could see the folds of the curtain quivering\r\ngently, as if stirred by some zephyr. Evidently the drama of the\r\nsituation was not lost on Hildebrand Spencer, twelfth Earl of Dreever.\r\n\r\nNor was it lost on Jimmy. This was precisely the sort of situation that\r\nappealed to him. He had his plan of action clearly mapped out. He knew\r\nthat it would be useless to tell the knight the true facts of the case.\r\nSir Thomas was as deficient in simple faith as in Norman blood.\r\n\r\nTo all appearances this was a tight corner, but Jimmy fancied that he\r\nsaw his way out of it. Meanwhile, the situation appealed to him.\r\nCuriously enough, it was almost identical with the big scene in Act III\r\nof _Love, the Cracksman_ in which Arthur Mifflin had made such a hit as\r\nthe debonair burglar.\r\n\r\nJimmy proceeded to give his own idea of what the rendering of a debonair\r\nburglar should be. Arthur Mifflin had lit a cigarette, and had shot out\r\nsmoke-rings and repartee alternately. A cigarette would have been a\r\ngreat help here, but Jimmy prepared to do his best without properties.\r\n\r\n“So—so it’s you, is it?” said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n“Who told you!”\r\n\r\n“Thief! Low thief!”\r\n\r\n“Come, now,” protested Jimmy. “Why low? Just because you don’t know me\r\nover here, why scorn me? How do you know I haven’t got a big American\r\nreputation? For all you can tell, I may be Boston Willie or Sacramento\r\nSam, or some one. Let us preserve the decencies of debate.”\r\n\r\n“I had my suspicions of you. I had my suspicions from the first, when I\r\nheard that my idiot of a nephew had made a casual friend in London. So\r\nthis was what you were! A thief, who——”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind personally,” interrupted Jimmy, “but I hope, if ever you\r\nmix with cracksmen, you won’t call them thieves. They are frightfully\r\nsensitive. You see, there’s a world of difference between the two\r\nbranches of the profession, and a good deal of snobbish caste prejudice.\r\nLet us suppose that you were an actor-manager. How would you enjoy being\r\ncalled a super? You see the idea, don’t you? You’d hurt their feelings.\r\nNow, an ordinary thief would probably use violence in a case like this;\r\nbut violence, except in extreme cases—I hope this won’t be one of\r\nthem—is contrary, I understand, to cracksmen’s etiquette. On the other\r\nhand, Sir Thomas, candour compels me to add that I have you covered.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pipe in the pocket of his coat. He thrust the stem earnestly\r\nagainst the lining. Sir Thomas eyed the protuberance apprehensively, and\r\nturned a little pale. Jimmy was scowling ferociously. Arthur Mifflin’s\r\nscowl in Act III had been much admired.\r\n\r\n“My gun,” said Jimmy, “is, as you see, in my pocket. I always shoot from\r\nthe pocket, in spite of the tailor’s bills. The little fellow is loaded\r\nand cocked. He’s pointing straight at your diamond solitaire. That fatal\r\nspot! No one has ever been hit in the diamond solitaire and survived. My\r\nfinger is on the trigger, so I should recommend you not to touch that\r\nbell you are looking at. There are other reasons why you shouldn’t, but\r\nthose I will go into presently.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas’s hand wavered.\r\n\r\n“Do, if you like, of course,” said Jimmy agreeably—“it’s your own\r\nhouse—but I shouldn’t. I am a dead shot at a yard and a half. You\r\nwouldn’t believe the number of sitting haystacks I’ve picked off at that\r\ndistance. I simply can’t miss. On second thoughts, I sha’n’t fire to\r\nkill you. Let us be humane on this joyful occasion. I shall just smash\r\nyour knees—painful, but not fatal.”\r\n\r\nHe waggled his pipe suggestively. Sir Thomas blanched. His hand fell to\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\n“Great!” said Jimmy. “After all, why should you be in a hurry to break\r\nup this very pleasant little meeting? I’m sure I’m not. Let us chat. How\r\nare the theatricals going? Was the duologue a success? Wait till you see\r\nour show. Three of us knew our lines at the dress rehearsal.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas had backed away from the bell, but the retreat was merely for\r\nthe convenience of the moment. He understood that it might be injurious\r\nto press the button just then; but he had recovered his composure by\r\nthis time, and he saw that ultimately the game must be his.\r\n\r\nJimmy was trapped.\r\n\r\nHis face resumed its normal hue. Automatically his hands began to move\r\ntowards his coat-tails and his feet to spread themselves. Jimmy noted\r\nwith a smile these signs of restored complacency. He hoped ere long to\r\nupset that complacency somewhat.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas addressed himself to making Jimmy’s position clear to him.\r\n\r\n“How, may I ask,” he said, “do you propose to leave the castle?”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you let me have the motor?” said Jimmy. “But I expect I sha’n’t\r\nbe leaving just yet.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas laughed shortly.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “No; I fancy not. I am with you there!”\r\n\r\n“Great minds,” said Jimmy. “I shouldn’t be surprised if we thought alike\r\non all sorts of subjects. Just think how you came round to my views on\r\nringing the bell. In a flash! But what made you fancy that I intended to\r\nleave the castle?”\r\n\r\n“I should hardly have supposed that you would be anxious to stay.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary. It’s the one place I have been in in the last two\r\nyears that I have felt really satisfied with. Usually I want to move on\r\nafter a week. But I could stop here for ever.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, Mr. Pitt—by the way, an alias, of course?”\r\n\r\n“I fear not,” he said. “If I had chosen an alias, it would have been\r\nTressilyan, or Trevelyan, or something. I call Pitt a poor thing in\r\nnames. I once knew a man called Ronald Cheylesmore. Lucky fellow!”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas returned to the point on which he had been about to touch.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, Mr. Pitt, that you hardly realise your position.”\r\n\r\n“No?” said Jimmy, interested.\r\n\r\n“I find you in the act of stealing my wife’s necklace——”\r\n\r\n“Would there be any use in telling you that I was not stealing it, but\r\nputting it back?”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas raised his eyebrows in silence.\r\n\r\n“No?” said Jimmy. “I was afraid not. You were saying——”\r\n\r\n“I find you in the act of stealing my wife’s necklace,” proceeded Sir\r\nThomas, “and because for the moment you succeed in postponing arrest by\r\nthreatening me with a revolver——”\r\n\r\nAn agitated look came into Jimmy’s face.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!” he cried. He felt hastily in his pocket. “Yes,” he said;\r\n“as I had begun to fear. I owe you an apology, Sir Thomas,” he went on\r\nwith manly dignity, producing the briar. “I am entirely to blame. How\r\nthe mistake arose I cannot imagine, but I find it isn’t a revolver after\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas’s cheeks took on a richer tint of purple. He glared dumbly at\r\nthe pipe.\r\n\r\n“In the excitement of the moment, I suppose——” began Jimmy.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas interrupted. The recollection of his needless panic rankled\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\n“You—you—you——”\r\n\r\n“Count ten!”\r\n\r\n“You—what you propose to gain by this buffoonery I am at a loss——”\r\n\r\n“How can you say such savage things?” protested Jimmy. “Not buffoonery!\r\nWit! Esprit! Flow of soul such as circulates daily in the best society.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas almost leaped towards the bell. With his finger on it, he\r\nturned to deliver a final speech.\r\n\r\n“I believe you’re insane,” he cried; “but I’ll have no more of it. I\r\nhave endured this foolery long enough. I’ll——”\r\n\r\n“Just one moment,” said Jimmy. “I said just now that there were other\r\nreasons besides the revol—well, pipe—why you should not ring that bell.\r\nOne of them is that all the servants will be in their places in the\r\naudience, so that there won’t be any one to answer it. But that’s not\r\nthe most convincing reason. Will you listen to one more before getting\r\nbusy?”\r\n\r\n“I see your game. Don’t imagine for a moment that you trick me.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be further——”\r\n\r\n“You fancy you can gain time by talking, and find some way of escape——”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to escape. Don’t you realise that in about ten minutes\r\nI am due to play an important part in a great drama on the stage?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll keep you here, I tell you. You’ll leave this room,” said Sir\r\nThomas grandly, “over my body.”\r\n\r\n“Steeplechasing in the home,” murmured Jimmy. “No more dull evenings.\r\nBut listen—do listen. I won’t keep you a minute, and if you want to push\r\nthat bell after I’ve finished, you may push it six inches into the wall\r\nif you like.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Sir Thomas shortly.\r\n\r\n“Would you like me to lead gently up to what I want to say, gradually\r\npreparing you for the reception of the news, or shall I——”\r\n\r\nThe knight took out his watch.\r\n\r\n“I shall give you one minute,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Heavens, I must hustle! How many seconds have I got now?”\r\n\r\n“If you have anything to say, say it.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then,” said Jimmy. “It’s only this. That necklace is a\r\nfraud. The diamonds aren’t diamonds at all. They’re paste!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 27 ★\r\n                    _A Declaration of Independence_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Jimmy had entertained any doubts concerning the effectiveness of this\r\ndisclosure, they would have vanished at the sight of the other’s face.\r\nJust as the rich hues of a sunset pale slowly into an almost\r\nimperceptible green, so did the purple of Sir Thomas’s cheeks become, in\r\nstages, first a dull red, then pink, and finally take on a uniform\r\npallor. His mouth hung open. His attitude of righteous defiance had\r\ncrumpled. Unsuspected creases appeared in his clothes. He had the\r\nappearance of one who has been caught in the machinery.\r\n\r\nJimmy was a little puzzled. He had expected to check the enemy, to bring\r\nhim to reason, but not to demolish him in that way. There was something\r\nin this which he did not understand. When Spike had handed him the\r\nstones, and his trained eye, after a moment’s searching examination, had\r\nmade him suspicious, and when, finally, a simple test had proved his\r\nsuspicions correct, he was comfortably aware that, though found with the\r\nnecklace on his person, he had knowledge which, communicated to Sir\r\nThomas, would serve him well. He knew that Lady Julia was not the sort\r\nof Lady who would bear calmly the announcement that her treasured rope\r\nof diamonds was a fraud. He knew enough of her to know that she would\r\ndemand another necklace, and see that she got it, and that Sir Thomas\r\nwas not one of those generous and expansive natures which think nothing\r\nof an expenditure of twenty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThis was the line of thought which had kept him cheerful during what\r\nmight otherwise have been a trying interview. He was aware from the\r\nfirst that Sir Thomas would not believe in the purity of his motives;\r\nbut he was convinced that the knight would be satisfied to secure his\r\nsilence on the subject of the paste necklace on any terms. He had looked\r\nforward to baffled rage, furious denunciation, and a dozen other\r\nexpressions of emotion, but certainly not to collapse of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe other had begun to make strange, gurgling noises.\r\n\r\n“Mind you,” said Jimmy, “it’s a very good imitation—I’ll say that for\r\nit. I didn’t suspect it till I had the thing in my hands. Looking at\r\nit—even quite close—I was taken in for a moment.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas swallowed nervously.\r\n\r\n“How did you know?” he muttered.\r\n\r\nAgain Jimmy was surprised. He had expected indignant denials and demands\r\nfor proof, excited reiteration of the statement that the stones had cost\r\ntwenty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n“How did I know?” he repeated. “If you mean what first made me suspect,\r\nI couldn’t tell you; it might have been one of a score of things. A\r\njeweller can’t say exactly how he gets on the track of faked stones. He\r\ncan feel them, he can almost smell them. I worked with a jeweller once;\r\nthat’s how I got my knowledge of jewels. But if you mean, can I prove\r\nwhat I say about this necklace, that’s easy. There’s no deception; it’s\r\nsimple. See here. These stones are supposed to be diamonds. Well, the\r\ndiamond is the hardest stone in existence—nothing will scratch it. Now,\r\nI’ve got a little ruby out of a pin which I know is genuine. By rights,\r\nthen, that ruby ought not to have scratched these stones. You follow\r\nthat? But it did. It scratched two of them, the only two I tried. If you\r\nlike I can continue the experiment, but there’s no need. I can tell you\r\nstraight away what these stones are. I said they were paste, but that\r\nwasn’t quite accurate. They’re a stuff called white jargoon. It’s a\r\nstuff that’s very easily worked. You work it with the flame of a\r\nblow-pipe. You don’t want a full description, I suppose? Anyway, what\r\nhappens is that the blow-pipe sets it up like a tonic, gives it\r\nincreased specific gravity, and a healthy complexion, and all sorts of\r\ngreat things of that kind. Two minutes in the flame of a blow-pipe is\r\nlike a week at the seaside to a bit of white jargoon. Are you satisfied?\r\nIf it comes to that, I suppose you can hardly be expected to be;\r\nconvinced is a better word. Are you convinced, or do you hanker after\r\ntests like polarised light and refracting liquids?”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas had staggered to a chair.\r\n\r\n“So that was how you knew!” he said.\r\n\r\n“That was—” began Jimmy, when a sudden suspicion flashed across his\r\nmind. He scrutinised Sir Thomas’s pallid face keenly.\r\n\r\n“Did you know?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHe wondered that the possibility had not occurred to him earlier.\r\n\r\n“By George, I believe you did!” he cried. “You must have done. So that’s\r\nhow it happened, is it? I don’t wonder it was a shock when I said I knew\r\nabout the necklace.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Pitt!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I have something to say to you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m listening.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas tried to rally. There was a touch of the old pomposity in his\r\nmanner when he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Pitt, I find you in an unpleasant position——”\r\n\r\nJimmy interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you worry about my unpleasant position,” he said. “Fix your\r\nattention exclusively upon your own. Let us be frank with one another.\r\nYou’re in the cart. What do you propose to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you,” he began.\r\n\r\n“No?” said Jimmy. “I’ll try and make my meaning clear. Correct me from\r\ntime to time if I am wrong. The way I size the thing up is as follows:\r\nWhen you married Lady Julia I gather that it was, so to speak, up to you\r\nto some extent. People knew you were a millionaire, and they expected\r\nsomething special in the way of gifts from the bridegroom to the bride.\r\nNow you, being of a prudent and economical nature, began to wonder if\r\nthere wasn’t some way of getting a reputation for lavishness without\r\nactually cashing up to any great extent. Am I right?”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas did not answer.\r\n\r\n“I am,” said Jimmy. “Well, it occurred to you, naturally enough, that a\r\nproperly-selected gift of jewellery might work the trick. It only needed\r\na little nerve. When you give a present of diamonds to a lady she is not\r\nlikely to call for polarised light and refracting liquids and the rest\r\nof the circus. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred she will take the\r\nthing on trust. Very well. You trotted off to a jeweller and put the\r\nthing to him confidentially. I expect you suggested paste; but, being a\r\nwily person, he pointed out that paste has a habit of not wearing well.\r\nIt is pretty enough when it’s new, but quite a small amount of ordinary\r\nwear and tear destroys the polish of the surface and the sharpness of\r\nthe cutting. It gets scratched easily. Having heard this, and reflected\r\nthat Lady Julia was not likely to keep the necklace under a glass case,\r\nyou rejected paste as too risky. The genial jeweller then suggested\r\nwhite jargoon, mentioning, as I have done, that after an application or\r\nso of the blow-pipe its own mother wouldn’t know it. If he was a bit of\r\nan antiquary, he probably added that in the eighteenth century jargoon\r\nstones were supposed to be actually an inferior sort of diamond. What\r\ncould be more suitable? ‘Make it jargoon, dear heart,’ you cried\r\njoyfully, and all was well. Am I right? I notice that you have not\r\ncorrected me so far.”\r\n\r\nWhether Sir Thomas would have replied in the affirmative is uncertain.\r\nHe was opening his mouth to speak when the curtain at the end of the\r\nroom heaved, and Lord Dreever burst out like a cannon-ball in tweeds.\r\n\r\nThe apparition effectually checked any speech that Sir Thomas might have\r\nbeen intending to make. Lying back in his chair, he goggled silently at\r\nthe new arrival. Even Jimmy, though knowing that his lordship was in\r\nhiding, was taken aback.\r\n\r\nHis lordship broke the silence.\r\n\r\n“Great Scot!” he cried.\r\n\r\nNeither Jimmy nor Sir Thomas seemed to consider the observation unsound\r\nor inadequate. They permitted it to pass without comment.\r\n\r\n“You old scoundrel!” added his lordship, addressing Sir Thomas; “and\r\nyou’re the man who called me a welsher!” There were signs of a flicker\r\nof spirit in the knight’s prominent eyes, but they died away. He made no\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“Great Scot!” moaned his lordship, in a fever of self-pity, “here have I\r\nbeen all these years letting you give me Hades in every shape and form,\r\nwhen all the while—— My goodness, if I’d only known earlier!”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Pitt, old man,” he said warmly, “I—dash it—I don’t know what to say. If\r\nit hadn’t been for you—I always did like Americans.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not one,” said Jimmy; but his lordship went on, unchecked.\r\n\r\n“I always thought it bally rot that that fuss happened in—in—wherever it\r\nwas. If it hadn’t been for fellows like you,” he continued, addressing\r\nSir Thomas once more, “there wouldn’t have been any of that frightful\r\nDeclaration of Independence business. Would there, Pitt, old man?”\r\n\r\nThese were deep problems too spacious for casual examination. Jimmy\r\nshrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Well, I should say Sir Thomas might not have got along with George\r\nWashington, anyhow,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Of course not. Well”—his lordship moved towards the door—“I’m off\r\ndownstairs to see what Aunt Julia has to say about it all.”\r\n\r\nA shudder, as if from some electric shock shook Sir Thomas. He leaped to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n“Spencer,” he cried, “I forbid you to say a word to your aunt.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said his lordship. “You do, do you?”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas shivered.\r\n\r\n“She would never let me hear the last of it.”\r\n\r\n“I bet she wouldn’t. I’ll go and see.”\r\n\r\n“Stop!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas dabbed at his forehead with his handkerchief. He dared not\r\nface the vision of Lady Julia in possession of the truth. At one time\r\nthe fear lest she might discover the harmless little deception he had\r\npractised had kept him awake at night, but gradually, as the days went\r\nby, and the excellence of the imitation stones had continued to impose\r\nupon her and upon every one else who saw them, the fear had diminished.\r\nBut it had always been at the back of his mind. Even in her calmer\r\nmoments his wife was a source of mild terror to him. His imagination\r\nreeled at the thought of what depths of aristocratic scorn and\r\nindignation she would plumb in a case like this.\r\n\r\n“Spencer,” he said, “I insist that you shall not inform your aunt of\r\nthis!”\r\n\r\n“What? You want me to keep my mouth shut? You want me to become an\r\naccomplice in this beastly, low-down deception? I like that!”\r\n\r\n“The point,” said Jimmy, “is well taken—_noblesse oblige_, and all that\r\nsort of thing. The blood of the Dreevers boils furiously at the idea.\r\nListen! You can hear it sizzling.”\r\n\r\nLord Dreever moved a step nearer the door.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” cried Sir Thomas again. “Spencer!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Spencer, my boy, it occurs to me that perhaps I have not always treated\r\nyou very well.”\r\n\r\n“‘Perhaps!’ ‘Not always!’ Great Scot! I’ll have a fiver each way on both\r\nthose. Considering you’ve treated me like a frightful kid practically\r\never since you’ve known me, I call that pretty rich. Why, what about\r\nthis very night, when I asked you for a few pounds?”\r\n\r\n“It was only the thought that you had been gambling——”\r\n\r\n“Gambling! How about palming off faked diamonds on Aunt Julia for a\r\ngamble?”\r\n\r\n“A game of skill, surely,” murmured Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking the matter over,” said Sir Thomas, “and if you\r\nreally need the—— Was it not fifty pounds?”\r\n\r\n“It was twenty,” said his lordship, “and I don’t need it. Keep it.\r\nYou’ll want all you can save for a new necklace.”\r\n\r\nHis fingers closed on the door-handle.\r\n\r\n“Spencer—stop!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“We must talk this over. We must not be hasty.”\r\n\r\nHe passed the handkerchief over his forehead.\r\n\r\n“In the past, perhaps,” he resumed, “our relations have not been quite——\r\nThe fault was mine. I have always endeavoured to do my duty. It is a\r\ndifficult task to look after a young man of your age——”\r\n\r\nHis lordship’s sense of his grievances made him eloquent.\r\n\r\n“Dash it all!” he cried. “That’s just what I jolly well complain of. Who\r\nthe dickens wanted you to look after me? Hang it! you’ve kept your eye\r\non me all these years like a frightful policeman! You cut off my\r\nallowance right in the middle of my time at the ’Varsity, just when I\r\nneeded it most, and I had to come and beg for money whenever I wanted to\r\nbuy a cigarette. I looked a fearful ass I can tell you! Men who knew me\r\nused to be dashed funny about it. I’m sick of the whole bally business.\r\nYou’ve given me a jolly thin time all this while, and now I’m going to\r\nget a bit of my own back. Wouldn’t you, Pitt, old man?”\r\n\r\nJimmy, thus suddenly appealed to, admitted that, in his lordship’s\r\nplace, he might have experienced a momentary temptation to do something\r\nof the kind.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said his lordship. “Any fellow would.”\r\n\r\n“But, Spencer, let me——”\r\n\r\n“You’ve soured my life,” said his lordship, frowning a tense, Byronic\r\nfrown. “That’s what you’ve done—soured my whole bally life. I’ve had a\r\nrotten time. I’ve had to go about touching my friends for money to keep\r\nme going. Why, I owe you a fiver, don’t I, Pitt, old man?”\r\n\r\nIt was a tenner, to be finickingly accurate about details, but Jimmy did\r\nnot say so. He concluded, rightly, that the memory of the original five\r\npounds which he had lent Lord Dreever at the Savoy Hotel had faded from\r\nthe other’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it,” he said.\r\n\r\n“But I do mention it,” protested his lordship shrilly. “It just proves\r\nwhat I say. If I had had a decent allowance it wouldn’t have happened.\r\nAnd you wouldn’t give me enough to set me going in the Diplomatic\r\nService. That’s another thing. Why wouldn’t you do that?”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas pulled himself together.\r\n\r\n“I hardly thought you qualified, my dear boy.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship did not actually foam at the mouth, but he looked as if he\r\nmight do so at any moment. Excitement and the memory of his wrongs,\r\nlubricated, as it were, by the champagne he had consumed both at and\r\nafter dinner, had produced in him a frame of mind far removed from the\r\nnormal. His manners no longer had that repose which stamps the caste of\r\nVere de Vere. He waved his hands.\r\n\r\n“I know, I know!” he shouted. “I know you didn’t. You thought me a\r\nfearful fool. I tell you I’m sick of it. And always trying to make me\r\nmarry money! Dashed humiliating! If she hadn’t been a jolly sensible\r\ngirl you’d have spoiled Miss McEachern’s life as well as mine. You came\r\nvery near it. I tell you, I’ve had enough of it. I’m in love! I’m in\r\nlove with the rippingest girl in England. You’ve seen her, Pitt, old\r\ntop. Isn’t she a ripper?”\r\n\r\nJimmy stamped the absent lady with the seal of his approval.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, if she’ll have me, I’m going to marry her.”\r\n\r\nThe dismay written on every inch of Sir Thomas’s countenance became\r\nintensified at these terrific words. Great as had been his contempt for\r\nthe actual holder of the title considered simply as a young man, he had\r\nalways been filled with a supreme respect for the Dreever name.\r\n\r\n“But, Spencer,” he almost howled, “consider your position! You cannot——”\r\n\r\n“Can’t I, by Jove! if she’ll have me; and dash my position! What’s my\r\nposition got to do with it? Katie’s the daughter of a general, if it\r\ncomes to that. Her brother was at the House with me. If I had a penny to\r\ncall my own I’d have asked her to marry me ages ago. Don’t you worry\r\nabout my position!”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas croaked feebly.\r\n\r\n“Now, look here,” said his lordship, with determination. “Here’s the\r\nwhole thing in a jolly old nutshell. If you want me to forget about this\r\nlittle flutter in fake diamonds of yours you’ve got to pull your socks\r\nup and start in to do things. You’ve got to get me attached to some\r\nEmbassy, for a beginning. It won’t be difficult. There’s dozens of old\r\nboys in London who knew the governor when he was alive who will jump at\r\nthe chance of doing me a good turn. I know I’m a bit of an ass in some\r\nways, but that’s expected of you in the Diplomatic Service. They only\r\nwant you to wear evening clothes as if you were used to them, and be a\r\nbit of a flier at dancing, and I can fill the bill all right as far as\r\nthat goes. And you’ve got to give your jolly old blessing to Katie and\r\nme—if she’ll have me. That’s about all I can think of for the moment.\r\nNow do we go? Are you on?”\r\n\r\n“It’s preposterous,” began Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\nLord Dreever gave the door-handle a rattle. He stopped.\r\n\r\n“It’s a hold-up all right,” said Jimmy soothingly. “I don’t want to butt\r\nin on a family conclave, but my advice, if asked, would be to unbelt\r\nbefore the shooting begins. You’ve got something worse than a pipe\r\npointing at you now. As regards my position in the business, don’t\r\nworry. My silence is thrown in gratis. Give me one loving smile and my\r\nlips are sealed.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas turned on him.\r\n\r\n“As for you——” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Never mind about Pitt,” said his lordship. “He’s a dashed good fellow,\r\nPitt. I wish there were more like him. And he wasn’t pinching the stuff\r\neither. If you had only listened when he tried to tell you, you mightn’t\r\nbe in such a frightful hole. He was putting the things back, as he said.\r\nI know all about it. Well, what’s the answer?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Sir Thomas seemed on the point of refusal. But just as he\r\nwas about to speak his lordship opened the door, and at the movement he\r\ncollapsed again.\r\n\r\n“I will!” he cried. “I will!”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said his lordship, with satisfaction. “That’s a bargain. Coming\r\ndownstairs, Pitt, old man? We shall be wanted on the stage in about half\r\na minute.”\r\n\r\n“As an antidote to stage-fright,” said Jimmy, as they went along the\r\ncorridor, “little discussions of that kind may be highly recommended. I\r\nshouldn’t mind betting that you feel fit for anything.”\r\n\r\n“I feel like a two-year-old,” assented his lordship enthusiastically.\r\n“I’ve forgotten all my part, but I don’t care. I’ll just go on and talk\r\nto them.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Jimmy, “is the right spirit. Charteris will get heart\r\ndisease, but it’s the right spirit. A little more of that sort of thing\r\nand amateur theatricals would be worth listening to. Step lively,\r\nRoscius; the stage waits.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 28 ★\r\n                    _Spennie’s Hour of Clear Vision_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern sat in the billiard-room smoking. He was alone. From where\r\nhe sat he could hear distant strains of music. The more rigorous portion\r\nof the evening’s entertainment, the theatricals, was over, and the\r\nnobility and gentry, having done their duty by sitting through the\r\nperformance, were now enjoying themselves in the ballroom. Everybody was\r\nhappy. The play had been quite as successful as the usual amateur\r\nperformance. The prompter had made himself a great favourite from the\r\nstart, his series of duets with Spennie having been especially admired,\r\nand Jimmy, as became an old professional, had played his part with great\r\nfinish and certainty of touch, though, like the bloodhounds in the\r\nperformance of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” on tour, he had had poor support.\r\nBut the audience bore no malice.\r\n\r\nNo collection of individuals is less vindictive than an audience at\r\namateur theatricals. It was all over now. Charteris had literally\r\ngibbered in the presence of eye-witnesses at one point in the second\r\nact, when Spennie, by giving a wrong cue, had jerked the play abruptly\r\ninto Act III (where his colleagues, dimly suspecting something wrong,\r\nbut not knowing what, had kept it for some two minutes, to the\r\nmystification of the audience); but now even he had begun to forget. As\r\nhe two-stepped down the room the lines of agony on his face were\r\nsoftened. He even smiled.\r\n\r\nAs for Spennie, the brilliance of his happy grin dazzled all beholders.\r\n\r\nHe was still wearing it when he invaded the solitude of Mr. McEachern.\r\nIn every dance, however greatly he may be enjoying it, there comes a\r\ntime when a man needs a meditative cigarette apart from the throng. It\r\ncame to Spennie after the seventh item on the programme. The billiard\r\nroom struck him as admirably suitable in every way. It was not likely to\r\nbe used as a sitting out place, and it was near enough to the ballroom\r\nto enable him to hear when the music of item No. 9 should begin.\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern was glad to see him. In the turmoil following the\r\ntheatricals he had been unable to get a word with any of the persons\r\nwith whom he most wished to speak. He had been surprised that no\r\nannouncement of the engagement had been made at the end of the\r\nperformance. Spennie would be able to supply him with information as to\r\nwhen the announcement might be expected.\r\n\r\nSpennie hesitated for an instant when he saw who was in the room. He was\r\nnot over-anxious for a _tête-à-tête_ with Molly’s father just then; but\r\nreflecting that after all he, Spennie, was not to blame for any\r\ndisappointment that might be troubling the other, he switched on his\r\ngrin again and walked in.\r\n\r\n“Came in for a smoke,” he explained, by way of opening the conversation.\r\n“Not dancing the next.”\r\n\r\n“Come in, my boy, come in,” said Mr. McEachern. “I was waiting to see\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nSpennie regretted his entrance. He had supposed that the other had heard\r\nthe news of the breaking-off of the engagement. Evidently, from his\r\nmanner, he had not. This was a nuisance.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and lit a cigarette, casting about the while for an\r\ninnocuous topic of conversation.\r\n\r\n“Like the show?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Fine,” said Mr. McEachern. “By the way—”\r\n\r\nSpennie groaned inwardly. He had forgotten that a determined man can\r\nchange the conversation to any subject he pleases by means of those\r\nthree words.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said Mr. McEachern, “I thought Sir Thomas—wasn’t your\r\nuncle intending to announce——?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, he was,” said Spennie.\r\n\r\n“Going to declare it during the dancing, maybe?”\r\n\r\n“Well—er—no. The fact is, he’s not going to do it at all, don’t you\r\nknow.” He inspected the red end of his cigarette closely. “As a matter\r\nof fact, it’s kind of broken off.”\r\n\r\nThe other’s exclamation jarred on him. Rotten, having to talk about this\r\nsort of thing!\r\n\r\n“Broken off?”\r\n\r\nSpennie nodded.\r\n\r\n“Miss McEachern thought it over, don’t you know,” he said, “and came to\r\nthe conclusion that it wasn’t good enough.”\r\n\r\nNow that it was said he felt easier. It had merely been the awkwardness\r\nof having to touch on the thing that had troubled him. That his news\r\nmight be a blow to McEachern did not cross his mind. He was a singularly\r\nmodest youth, and though he realised vaguely that his title had a\r\ncertain value in some people’s eyes, he could not understand anyone\r\nmourning over the loss of him as a son-in-law. Katie’s father, the old\r\ngeneral, thought him a fool, and once, during an attack of gout, had\r\nsaid so.\r\n\r\nOblivious, therefore, to the storm raging a yard away from him, he\r\nsmoked on with great contentment, till suddenly it struck him that, for\r\na presumably devout lover, jilted that very night, he was displaying too\r\nlittle emotion. He debated swiftly within himself whether he should have\r\na dash at manly grief, but came to the conclusion that it could not be\r\ndone. Melancholy on this maddest, merriest day of all the glad New Year,\r\nthe day on which he had utterly routed the powers of evil, as\r\nrepresented by Sir Thomas, was impossible.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t have done, don’t you know,” he said. “We weren’t suited.\r\nWhat I mean to say is, I’m a bit of a dashed sort of silly ass in some\r\nways, if you know what I mean. A girl like Miss McEachern couldn’t have\r\nbeen happy with me. She wants one of those capable, energetic fellers.”\r\n\r\nThis struck him as a good beginning—modest but not grovelling. He\r\ncontinued, tapping quite a respectably deep vein of philosophy as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n“You see, dear old top—I mean sir—you see, it’s like this. As far as\r\nwomen are concerned, fellers are divided into two classes. There’s the\r\nmasterful, capable Johnnies and the—er—the other sort. Now, I’m the\r\nother sort. My idea of the happy married life is to be—well, not exactly\r\ndowntrodden, but—you know what I mean—kind of second fiddle. I want a\r\nwife”—his voice grew soft and dreamy—“who’ll pet me a good deal, don’t\r\nyou know, stroke my hair a lot, and all that. I haven’t it in me to do\r\nthe master-in-my-own-house business. For me the silent-devotion\r\ntouch—sleepin’ on the mat outside her door, don’t you know, when she\r\nwasn’t feeling well, and bein’ found there in the morning, and being\r\nrather cosseted for my thoughtfulness. That’s the sort of idea. Hard to\r\nput it quite OK, but you know the sort of thing I mean. A feller’s got\r\nto realise his jolly old limitations if he wants to be happy though\r\nmarried; what? Now, suppose Miss McEachern was to marry me! Great Scot,\r\nshe’d be bored to death in a week! Honest. She couldn’t help herself.\r\nShe wants a chap with the same amount of go in him that she’s got.”\r\n\r\nHe lit another cigarette. He was feeling pleased with himself. Never\r\nbefore had ideas marshalled themselves in his mind in such long and\r\nwell-ordered ranks. He felt that he could go on talking like this all\r\nnight. He was getting brainier every minute. He remembered reading in\r\nsome book somewhere of a girl (or chappie) who had had her (or his)\r\n“hour of clear vision”. This was precisely what had happened now.\r\nWhether it was owing to the excitement of what had taken place that\r\nnight, or because he had been keeping up his thinking powers with\r\nexcellent dry champagne, he did not know. All he knew was that he felt\r\non top of his subject. He wished he had had a larger audience. “A girl\r\nlike Miss McEachern,” he resumed, “doesn’t want any of the hair-stroking\r\nbusiness. She’d simply laugh at a feller if he asked for it. She needs a\r\nchappie of the Get On or Get Out type—somebody in the six-cylinder\r\nclass. And as a matter of fact, between ourselves, I rather think she’s\r\nfound him.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern half rose from his chair. All his old fears had come\r\nsurging back.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Fact,” said his lordship, nodding. “Mind you, I don’t know for certain.\r\nAs the girl says in the song, I don’t know, but I guess. What I mean to\r\nsay is, they seemed jolly friendly and all that—calling each other by\r\ntheir Christian names, and so on.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Pitt,” said his lordship. He was leaning back, blowing a smoke-ring at\r\nthe moment, so did not see the look on the other’s face and the sudden\r\ngrip of his fingers on the arms of his chair. He went on with some\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy Pitt!” he said. “Now, there’s a feller. Full of oats to the brim,\r\nand fairly bursting with go and energy. A girl wouldn’t have a dull\r\nmoment with a chap like that. You know,” he proceeded confidentially,\r\n“there’s a lot in this idea of affinities. Take my word for it, dear\r\nold—sir. There’s a girl up in London, for instance. Now, she and I hit\r\nit off most amazingly. There’s hardly a thing we don’t think alike\r\nabout. For instance, ‘The Merry Widow’ didn’t make a bit of a hit with\r\nher; nor did it with me, yet look at the millions of people who raved\r\nabout it. And neither of us like oysters. We’re affinities—that’s why.\r\nYou see the same sort of thing all over the place. It’s a jolly queer\r\nbusiness. Sometimes makes me believe in re—in-what’s-its-name—you know\r\nwhat I mean. All that in the poem, you know. How does it go? ‘When you\r\nwere a tiddley-om-pom and I was a thingummajig.’ Dashed brainy bit of\r\nwork. I was reading it only the other day. Well, what I mean to say is,\r\nit’s my belief that Jimmy Pitt and Miss McEachern are by way of being\r\nsomething in that line. Doesn’t it strike you that they are just the\r\nsort to get on together? You can see it with half an eye. You can’t help\r\nliking a feller like Jimmy Pitt. He’s a sport! I wish I could tell you\r\nsome of the things he’s done, but I can’t, for reasons; but you can take\r\nit from me he’s a sport. You ought to cultivate him. You’d like him....\r\nOh, dash it! there’s the music! I must be off. Got to dance this one.”\r\n\r\nHe rose from his chair and dropped his cigarette into the ash-tray.\r\n\r\n“So long,” he said, with a friendly nod. “Wish I could stop, but it’s no\r\ngo. That’s the last let-up I shall have to-night.”\r\n\r\nHe went out, leaving Mr. McEachern seated in his chair, a prey to many\r\nand varied emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 29 ★\r\n                            _The Last Round_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had only been gone a few minutes when Mr. McEachern’s meditations\r\nwere again interrupted. This time the visitor was a stranger to him—a\r\ndark-faced, clean-shaven man. He did not wear evening clothes, so could\r\nnot be one of the guests; and Mr. McEachern could not place him\r\nimmediately. Then he remembered. He had seen him in Sir Thomas Blunt’s\r\ndressing room. This was Sir Thomas’s valet.\r\n\r\n“Might I have a word with you, sir?”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked McEachern, staring heavily. His mind had not\r\nrecovered from the effect of Lord Dreever’s philosophical remarks. There\r\nwas something of a cloud on his brain. To judge from his lordship’s\r\nwords, things had been happening behind his back; and the idea of Molly\r\ndeceiving him was too strange to be assimilated in an instant. He looked\r\nat the valet dully.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he asked again.\r\n\r\n“I must apologise for intruding, but I thought it best to approach you\r\nbefore making my report to Sir Thomas.”\r\n\r\n“Your report?”\r\n\r\n“I am employed by a private inquiry agency.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir—Wragge’s. You may have heard of us, in Holborn Bars; very old\r\nestablished, divorce a speciality. You will have seen the\r\nadvertisements. Sir Thomas wrote asking for a man, and the governor sent\r\nme down. I have been with the house some years. My job, I gathered, was\r\nto keep my eyes open generally. Sir Thomas, it seemed, had no suspicions\r\nof any definite person. I was to be on the spot just in case, in a\r\nmanner of speaking. And it’s precious lucky I was, or her ladyship’s\r\njewels would have been gone. I’ve done a fair cop this very night.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and eyed the ex-policeman keenly. McEachern was obviously\r\nexcited. Could Jimmy have made an attempt on the jewels during the\r\ndance? Or Spike?\r\n\r\n“Say,” he said, “was it a red headed——?”\r\n\r\nThe detective was watching him with a curious smile.\r\n\r\n“No, he wasn’t red headed. You seem interested, sir. I thought you would\r\nbe. I will tell you all about it. I had had my suspicions of this party\r\never since he arrived. And I may say that it struck me at the time that\r\nthere was something mighty fishy about the way he got into the castle.”\r\n\r\nMcEachern started. So he had not been the only one to suspect Jimmy’s\r\nmotives in attaching himself to Lord Dreever.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I suspected that there was some game on, and it struck me that this\r\nwould be the day for the attempt, the house being upside down, in a\r\nmanner of speaking, on account of the theatricals. And I was right. I\r\nkept near those jewels on and off all day, and presently, just as I had\r\nthought, along comes this fellow. He’d hardly got to the door when I was\r\non him.”\r\n\r\n“Good boy! You’re no rube.”\r\n\r\n“We fought for a while, but, being a bit to the good in strength, and\r\nknowing something about the game, I had the irons on him pretty quick,\r\nand took him off and locked him in the cellar. That’s how it was, sir.”\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern’s relief was overwhelming. If Lord Dreever’s statement was\r\ncorrect, and Jimmy had really succeeded in winning Molly’s affection,\r\nthis would be indeed a rescue at the eleventh hour. It was with a _Nunc\r\nDimittis_ air he felt for his cigar case and extended it towards the\r\ndetective. A cigar from his own private case was with him a mark of the\r\nsupremest favour and good will—a sort of accolade which he bestowed only\r\nupon the really meritorious few.\r\n\r\nUsually it was received with becoming deference, but on this occasion\r\nthere was a somewhat startling deviation from routine, for, just as he\r\nwas opening the case, something cold and hard pressed against each of\r\nhis wrists; there was a snap and a click, and looking up, dazed, he saw\r\nthat the detective had sprung back, and was contemplating him with a\r\ngrim smile over the barrel of an ugly-looking little revolver.\r\n\r\nGuilty or innocent, the first thing a man does, when he finds handcuffs\r\non his wrists, is to try to get them off. The action is automatic. Mr.\r\nMcEachern strained at the steel chain till the veins stood out on his\r\nforehead. His great body shook with rage.\r\n\r\nThe detective eyed his efforts with some satisfaction. The picture\r\npresented by the other, as he heaved and tugged, was that of a guilty\r\nman trapped.\r\n\r\n“It’s no good, my friend,” he said.\r\n\r\nHis voice brought McEachern back to his senses. In the first shock of\r\nthe thing the primitive man in him had led him beyond the confines of\r\nself-restraint. He had simply struggled unthinkingly. Now he came to\r\nhimself again.\r\n\r\nHe shook his manacled hands furiously.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean?” he shouted. “What the——”\r\n\r\n“Less noise,” said the detective sharply. “Get back!” he snapped, as the\r\nother took a step forward.\r\n\r\n“Do you know who I am?” thundered McEachern.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the detective. “And that’s just why you’re wearing those\r\nbracelets. Come, now, don’t be a fool, the game’s up; can’t you see\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\nMcEachern leaned helplessly against the billiard-table. He felt weak.\r\nEverything was unreal. Had he gone mad? he wondered.\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said the detective—“stay there. You can’t do any harm\r\nthere. It was a pretty little game, I’ll admit. You worked it\r\nwell—meeting your old friend from New York and all, and having him\r\ninvited to the castle. Very pretty. New York, indeed! Seen about as much\r\nof New York as I have of Timbuctoo. I saw through him.”\r\n\r\nSome inkling of the truth began to penetrate McEachern’s consciousness.\r\nHe had become so obsessed with the idea that, as the captive was not\r\nSpike, it must be Jimmy, that the possibility of Mr. Galer being the\r\nsubject of discussion only dawned upon him now.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” he cried. “Who is it that you have arrested?”\r\n\r\n“Blest if I know. You can tell me that, I should think, seeing he’s an\r\nold Timbuctoo friend of yours. Galer’s the name he goes by here.”\r\n\r\n“Galer!”\r\n\r\n“That’s the man. And do you know what he had the impudence, the gall, to\r\ntell me? That he was in my own line of business. A detective! He said\r\nyou had sent for him to come here.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed amusedly at the recollection.\r\n\r\n“And so he is, you fool. So I did.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you did, did you? And what business had you bringing detectives\r\ninto other people’s houses?”\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern started to answer, but checked himself. Never before had\r\nhe appreciated to the full the depth and truth of the proverb relating\r\nto the frying-pan and the fire. To clear himself he must mention his\r\nsuspicions of Jimmy, and also his reasons for those suspicions. And to\r\ndo that would mean revealing his past. It was Scylla and Charybdis.\r\n\r\nA drop of perspiration trickled down his temple.\r\n\r\n“What’s the good?” said the detective. “Mighty ingenious idea, that,\r\nonly you hadn’t allowed for there being a real detective in the house.\r\nIt was that chap pitching me that yarn that made me suspicious of you. I\r\nput two and two together. ‘Partners,’ I said to myself. I’d heard all\r\nabout you, scraping acquaintance with Sir Thomas and all. Mighty\r\ningenious. You become the old family friend, and then you let in your\r\npal. He gets the stuff and hands it over to you. Nobody dreams of\r\nsuspecting you, and there you are. Honestly, now, wasn’t that the game?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all a mistake——” McEachern was beginning, when the door-handle\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nThe detective looked over his shoulder. McEachern glared dumbly. This\r\nwas the crowning blow, that there should be spectators of his\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\nJimmy strolled into the room.\r\n\r\n“Dreever told me you were in here,” he said to McEachern. “Can you spare\r\nme a—— Halloa!”\r\n\r\nThe detective had pocketed his revolver at the first sound of the\r\nhandle—to be discreet was one of the chief articles in the creed of the\r\nyoung men from Wragge’s Detective Agency—but handcuffs are not easily\r\nconcealed. Jimmy stood staring in amazement at McEachern’s wrists.\r\n\r\n“Some sort of a round game?” he inquired with interest.\r\n\r\nThe detective became confidential.\r\n\r\n“It’s this way, Mr. Pitt. There’s been some pretty deep work going on\r\nhere. There’s a regular gang of burglars in the place. This chap here’s\r\none of them.”\r\n\r\n“What, Mr. McEachern?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what he calls himself.”\r\n\r\nIt was all Jimmy could do to keep himself from asking Mr. McEachern\r\nwhether he attributed his downfall to drink. He contented himself with a\r\nsorrowful shake of the head at the fermenting captive. Then he took up\r\nthe part of counsel for the defence.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” he said. “What makes you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Why, this afternoon I caught this man’s pal—the fellow that calls\r\nhimself Galer——”\r\n\r\n“I know the man,” said Jimmy. “He’s a detective really. Mr. McEachern\r\nbrought him down here.”\r\n\r\nThe sleuth’s jaw dropped limply, as if he had received a blow.\r\n\r\n“What?” he said, in a feeble voice.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I tell you——” began Mr. McEachern; but the sleuth was occupied\r\nwith Jimmy. That sickening premonition of disaster was beginning to\r\nsteal over him. Dimly he began to perceive that he had blundered.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jimmy. “Why, I can’t say; but Mr. McEachern was afraid some\r\none might try to steal Lady Julia Blunt’s rope of diamonds, so he wrote\r\nto London for this man Galer. It was officious, perhaps, but not\r\ncriminal. I doubt if, legally, you could handcuff a man for a thing like\r\nthat. What have you done with good Mr. Galer?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve locked him in the coal-cellar,” said the detective dismally. The\r\nthought of the interview in prospect with the human bloodhound he had so\r\nmishandled was not exhilarating.\r\n\r\n“Locked him in the cellar, did you?” said Jimmy. “Well, well, I dare say\r\nhe’s very happy there. He’s probably busy detecting black-beetles.\r\nStill, perhaps you had better go and let him out. Possibly if you were\r\nto apologise to him—— Eh? Just as you think—I only suggest. If you want\r\nsomebody to vouch for Mr. McEachern’s non-burglariousness, I can do it.\r\nHe is a gentleman of private means, and we knew each other out in New\r\nYork.”\r\n\r\n“I never thought——”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Jimmy, with sympathetic friendliness, “if you will allow me\r\nto say so, is the cardinal mistake you detectives make. You never do\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\n“It never occurred to me——”\r\n\r\nHe took the key of the handcuffs from his pocket and toyed with it. Mr.\r\nMcEachern emitted a low growl. It was enough.\r\n\r\n“If you wouldn’t mind, Mr. Pitt,” said the detective obsequiously. He\r\nthrust the key into Jimmy’s hands and fled. Jimmy unlocked the\r\nhandcuffs. Mr. McEachern rubbed his wrists.\r\n\r\n“Ingenious little things,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“I’m much obliged to you,” growled Mr. McEachern, without looking up.\r\n\r\n“Not at all—a pleasure. This circumstantial evidence business is the\r\ndevil, isn’t it? I knew a man who broke into a house in New York to win\r\na bet, and to this day the owner of the house thinks him a professional\r\nburglar.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” said Mr. McEachern sharply.\r\n\r\n“Why do I say ‘a man’? Why am I so elusive and mysterious? You’re quite\r\nright. It sounds more dramatic; but, after all, what you want is facts.\r\nVery well. I broke into your house that night to win a bet. That’s the\r\nlimpid truth.”\r\n\r\nMcEachern was staring at him. Jimmy proceeded.\r\n\r\n“You are just about to ask—what was Spike Mullins doing with me? Well,\r\nSpike had broken into my flat an hour before, and I took him along with\r\nme as a sort of guide, philosopher, and friend.”\r\n\r\n“Spike Mullins said you were a burglar from England.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I rather led him to think so. I had been to see the opening\r\nperformance of a burglar-play called _Love, the Cracksman_, that night,\r\nand I worked off on Spike some severely technical information I had\r\nreceived from a pal of mine who played lead in the show. I told you when\r\nI came in that I had been talking to Lord Dreever. Well, what he was\r\nsaying to me was that he had met this very actor-man, a fellow called\r\nMifflin—Arthur Mifflin—in London just before he met me. He’s in London\r\nnow, rehearsing for a show that’s come over from America. You see the\r\nimportance of this item? It means that if you doubt my story all you\r\nneed to do is to find Mifflin—I forget what theatre his play is coming\r\non at, but you could find out in a second—and ask him to corroborate.\r\nAre you satisfied?”\r\n\r\nMcEachern did not answer. An hour before he would have fought to the\r\nlast ditch for his belief in Jimmy’s crookedness, but the events of the\r\nlast ten minutes had shaken him. He felt something of a reaction in\r\nJimmy’s favour.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Mr. McEachern,” said Jimmy, “I wish you would listen quietly\r\nto me for a minute or two. There’s really no reason on earth why we\r\nshould be at one another’s throats in this way. We might just as well be\r\nfriends. Let’s shake hands and call the fight off. I suppose you know\r\nwhy I came here to see you?” McEachern did not speak.\r\n\r\n“You know that your daughter has broken off her engagement to Lord\r\nDreever?”\r\n\r\n“Then he was right!” said McEachern, half to himself. “It is you?”\r\n\r\nJimmy nodded. McEachern drummed his fingers on the table and stared\r\nthoughtfully at him.\r\n\r\n“Is Molly——?” he said, at length. “Does Molly——?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nMcEachern continued his drumming.\r\n\r\n“Don’t think there’s been anything underhand about this,” said Jimmy.\r\n“She absolutely refused to do anything unless you gave your consent. She\r\nsaid you had been partners all her life, and she was going to do the\r\nsquare thing by you.”\r\n\r\n“She did?” said McEachern eagerly.\r\n\r\n“I think you ought to do the square thing by her. I’m not much, but she\r\nwants me. Do the square thing by her.”\r\n\r\nMcEachern was staring straight in front of him. There was a look in his\r\neyes which Jimmy had never seen there before—a frightened, hunted look.\r\n\r\n“It’s too late,” he burst out. “I’ll be square with her now, but it’s\r\ntoo late. I won’t stand in her way when I can make her happy. But I’ll\r\nlose her! Oh, my God, I’ll lose her!\r\n\r\n“Did you think I had never said to myself,” he went on, “the things you\r\nsaid to me that day when we met here? Did you think I didn’t know what I\r\nwas? Who should know it better than myself? But she didn’t—I’d kept it\r\nfrom her. I’d sweat for fear she would find out some day. When I came\r\nover here I thought I was safe; and then you came, and I saw you\r\ntogether. I thought you were a crook—you were with Mullins in New York—I\r\ntold her you were a crook.”\r\n\r\n“You told her that?”\r\n\r\n“I said I knew it. I couldn’t tell her the truth why I thought so. I\r\nsaid I had made inquiries in New York and found out about you.”\r\n\r\nJimmy saw now. The mystery was solved. So that was why Molly had allowed\r\nthem to force her into the engagement with Dreever.\r\n\r\n“I see,” he said slowly.\r\n\r\nMcEachern gripped the table in silence.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Jimmy again. “You mean she’ll want an explanation?”\r\n\r\nHe thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n“You must tell her,” he said quickly. “For your own sake you must tell\r\nher. Go and do it now. Wake up, man!” He shook him by the shoulder. “Go\r\nand do it now. She’ll forgive you. Don’t be afraid of that. Go and look\r\nfor her and tell her now.”\r\n\r\nMcEachern roused himself.\r\n\r\n“I will,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s the only way,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nMcEachern opened the door, then fell back a pace. Jimmy could hear\r\nvoices in the passage outside. He recognised Lord Dreever’s.\r\n\r\nMcEachern continued to back away from the door.\r\n\r\nLord Dreever entered, with Molly on his arm.\r\n\r\n“Halloa!” said his lordship, looking round.\r\n\r\n“Halloa, Pitt! Here we all are; what?”\r\n\r\n“Lord Dreever wanted to smoke,” said Molly.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, but there was anxiety in her eyes. She looked quickly at her\r\nfather and at Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Molly, my dear,” said McEachern huskily, “I want to speak to you for a\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\nJimmy took his lordship by the arm.\r\n\r\n“Come along, Dreever,” he said. “You can come and sit out with me. We’ll\r\ngo and smoke on the terrace.”\r\n\r\nThey left the room together.\r\n\r\n“What does the old boy want?” inquired his lordship. “Are you and Miss\r\nMcEachern——?”\r\n\r\n“We are,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“By Jove! I say, old chap! Million congratulations and all that sort of\r\nrot, you know!”\r\n\r\nHis lordship had to resume his duties in the ballroom after a while; but\r\nJimmy sat on, smoking and thinking.\r\n\r\nIn the general stillness the opening of the door at the top of the steps\r\ncame sharply to his ears. He looked up. Two figures were silhouetted for\r\na moment against the light, and then the door closed again. They began\r\nto move slowly down the steps.\r\n\r\nJimmy had recognised them. He got up. He was in the shadow; they could\r\nnot see him. They began to walk down the terrace. They were quite close\r\nnow. Neither was speaking, but presently, when they were but a few feet\r\naway, they stopped. There was the splutter of a match, and McEachern lit\r\na cigar. In the yellow light his face was clearly visible. Jimmy looked,\r\nand was content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ★ 30 ★\r\n                              _Conclusion_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American liner _St. Louis_ lay in the Empress Dock at Southampton,\r\ntaking aboard her passengers. All sorts and conditions of men flowed in\r\nan unceasing stream up the gangway.\r\n\r\nLeaning over the second-class railing, Jimmy Pitt and Spike Mullins\r\nwatched them thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Well, Spike,” said Jimmy, “your schooner’s on the tide now, isn’t it?\r\nYour vessel’s at the quay. You’ve got some queer-looking\r\nfellow-travellers. Don’t miss the two Cingalese sports and the man in\r\nthe turban and baggy breeches. I wonder if they’re airtight? Useful if\r\nhe fell overboard.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said Spike, directing a contemplative eye towards the garment in\r\nquestion. “He knows his business.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what those men on the deck are writing? They’ve been\r\nscribbling away ever since we came here. Probably society journalists.\r\nWe shall see in next week’s papers, ‘Among the second-class passengers\r\nwe noticed Mr. “Spike” Mullins looking as cheery as ever.’ It’s a pity\r\nyou’re so set on going, Spike. Why not change your mind and stop?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Spike looked wistful. Then his countenance resumed its\r\nwoodenness. “Dere ain’t no use for me dis side, boss,” he said. “New\r\nYork’s de spot. Youse don’t want none of me now you’re married. How’s\r\nMiss Molly, boss?”\r\n\r\n“Splendid, Spike, thanks. We’re going over to France by to-night’s boat.\r\n\r\n“It’s been a queer business,” said Jimmy, after a pause—“a deuced queer\r\nbusiness. Still, I’ve come very well out of it, at any rate. It seems to\r\nme that you’re the only one of us who doesn’t end happily, Spike. I’m\r\nmarried. McEachern’s butted into society so deep that it would take an\r\nexcavating party with dynamite to get him out of it. Molly—well, Molly’s\r\nmade a bad bargain, but I hope she won’t regret it. We’re all going\r\nsome, except you. You’re going out on the old trail again—which begins\r\nin Third Avenue and ends in Sing Sing. Why tear yourself away, Spike?”\r\n\r\nSpike concentrated his gaze on a weedy young emigrant in a blue jersey,\r\nwho was having his eye examined by the overworked doctor, and seemed to\r\nbe resenting it.\r\n\r\n“Dere’s nuttin’ doin’ dis side, boss,” he said at length. “I want to get\r\nbusy.”\r\n\r\n“Ulysses Mullins!” said Jimmy, looking at him curiously. “I know the\r\nfeeling. There’s only one cure. I sketched it out for you once, but I\r\ndoubt if you’ll ever take it. You don’t think a lot of women, do you?\r\nYou’re the rugged bachelor.”\r\n\r\n“Goils——!” began Spike comprehensively, and abandoned the topic without\r\ndilating on it further.\r\n\r\n“Dose were great jools, boss,” said Spike thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“I believe you’re still brooding over them, Spike.”\r\n\r\n“We could have got away wit dem, if you’d have stood for it—dead easy.”\r\n\r\n“You are brooding over them. Spike, I’ll tell you something which will\r\nconsole you a little before you start out on your wanderings. It’s in\r\nconfidence, so keep it dark. That necklace was paste.”\r\n\r\n“What’s dat?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing but paste. I spotted it directly you handed them to me. It\r\nwasn’t worth a hundred dollars.”\r\n\r\nA light of understanding came into Spike’s eyes. His face beamed with\r\nthe smile of one to whom dark matters are made clear.\r\n\r\n“So dat’s why you wouldn’t stand for getting away wit it!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe last voyager had embarked. The deck was full to congestion.\r\n\r\n“They’ll be sending us ashore in a minute,” said Jimmy. “I’d better be\r\nmoving. Let me know how you’re getting on, Spike, from time to time. You\r\nknow the address. And, I say, it’s just possible you may find you want a\r\ndollar or two every now and then—when you’re going to buy another\r\naeroplane, for instance. Well, you know where to write to for it, don’t\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“T’anks, boss. But dat’ll be all right. I’m goin’ to sit in at anodder\r\ngame dis time—politics, boss. A fr’en’ of a mug what I knows has gotten\r\na pull. He’ll find me a job.”\r\n\r\n“Politics!” said Jimmy. “I never thought of that. ‘My brother Dan is an\r\nalderman with a grip on the Seventh Ward!’” he quoted softly. “Why,\r\nyou’ll be a boss before you know where you are.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said Spike, grinning modestly.\r\n\r\n“You ought to be a thundering success in American politics,” said Jimmy.\r\n“You’ve got all the necessary qualities.”\r\n\r\nA steward passed.\r\n\r\n“Any more for the shore?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Spike——” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, boss.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Jimmy. “And good luck.”\r\n\r\n                            * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe sun had gone behind the clouds. As the ship slid out on its way a\r\nstray beam pierced the greyness.\r\n\r\nIt shone on a red head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_."
