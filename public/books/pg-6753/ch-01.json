Mr Bickersdyke Walks behind the Bowler's Arm\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering what a prominent figure Mr John Bickersdyke was to be in\r\nMike Jackson's life, it was only appropriate that he should make a\r\ndramatic entry into it. This he did by walking behind the bowler's arm\r\nwhen Mike had scored ninety-eight, causing him thereby to be clean\r\nbowled by a long-hop.\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of the Ilsworth cricket week, and the house team\r\nwere struggling hard on a damaged wicket. During the first two matches\r\nof the week all had been well. Warm sunshine, true wickets, tea in the\r\nshade of the trees. But on the Thursday night, as the team champed\r\ntheir dinner contentedly after defeating the Incogniti by two wickets,\r\na pattering of rain made itself heard upon the windows. By bedtime it\r\nhad settled to a steady downpour. On Friday morning, when the team of\r\nthe local regiment arrived in their brake, the sun was shining once\r\nmore in a watery, melancholy way, but play was not possible before\r\nlunch. After lunch the bowlers were in their element. The regiment,\r\nwinning the toss, put together a hundred and thirty, due principally to\r\na last wicket stand between two enormous corporals, who swiped at\r\neverything and had luck enough for two whole teams. The house team\r\nfollowed with seventy-eight, of which Psmith, by his usual golf\r\nmethods, claimed thirty. Mike, who had gone in first as the star bat of\r\nthe side, had been run out with great promptitude off the first ball of\r\nthe innings, which his partner had hit in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof point. At close of play the regiment had made five without loss.\r\nThis, on the Saturday morning, helped by another shower of rain which\r\nmade the wicket easier for the moment, they had increased to a hundred\r\nand forty-eight, leaving the house just two hundred to make on a pitch\r\nwhich looked as if it were made of linseed.\r\n\r\nIt was during this week that Mike had first made the acquaintance of\r\nPsmith's family. Mr Smith had moved from Shropshire, and taken Ilsworth\r\nHall in a neighbouring county. This he had done, as far as could be\r\nascertained, simply because he had a poor opinion of Shropshire\r\ncricket. And just at the moment cricket happened to be the pivot of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n'My father,' Psmith had confided to Mike, meeting him at the station in\r\nthe family motor on the Monday, 'is a man of vast but volatile brain.\r\nHe has not that calm, dispassionate outlook on life which marks your\r\ntrue philosopher, such as myself. I--'\r\n\r\n'I say,' interrupted Mike, eyeing Psmith's movements with apprehension,\r\n'you aren't going to drive, are you?'\r\n\r\n'Who else? As I was saying, I am like some contented spectator of a\r\nPageant. My pater wants to jump in and stage-manage. He is a man of\r\nhobbies. He never has more than one at a time, and he never has that\r\nlong. But while he has it, it's all there. When I left the house this\r\nmorning he was all for cricket. But by the time we get to the ground he\r\nmay have chucked cricket and taken up the Territorial Army. Don't be\r\nsurprised if you find the wicket being dug up into trenches, when we\r\narrive, and the pro. moving in echelon towards the pavilion. No,' he\r\nadded, as the car turned into the drive, and they caught a glimpse of\r\nwhite flannels and blazers in the distance, and heard the sound of bat\r\nmeeting ball, 'cricket seems still to be topping the bill. Come along,\r\nand I'll show you your room. It's next to mine, so that, if brooding on\r\nLife in the still hours of the night, I hit on any great truth, I shall\r\npop in and discuss it with you.'\r\n\r\nWhile Mike was changing, Psmith sat on his bed, and continued to\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you're going to the 'Varsity?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Rather,' said Mike, lacing his boots. 'You are, of course? Cambridge,\r\nI hope. I'm going to King's.'\r\n\r\n'Between ourselves,' confided Psmith, 'I'm dashed if I know what's\r\ngoing to happen to me. I am the thingummy of what's-its-name.'\r\n\r\n'You look it,' said Mike, brushing his hair.\r\n\r\n'Don't stand there cracking the glass,' said Psmith. 'I tell you I am\r\npractically a human three-shies-a-penny ball. My father is poising me\r\nlightly in his hand, preparatory to flinging me at one of the milky\r\ncocos of Life. Which one he'll aim at I don't know. The least thing\r\nfills him with a whirl of new views as to my future. Last week we were\r\nout shooting together, and he said that the life of the gentleman-farmer\r\nwas the most manly and independent on earth, and that he had a good\r\nmind to start me on that. I pointed out that lack of early training\r\nhad rendered me unable to distinguish between a threshing-machine and\r\na mangel-wurzel, so he chucked that. He has now worked round to\r\nCommerce. It seems that a blighter of the name of Bickersdyke is\r\ncoming here for the week-end next Saturday. As far as I can say\r\nwithout searching the Newgate Calendar, the man Bickersdyke's career\r\nseems to have been as follows. He was at school with my pater, went\r\ninto the City, raked in a certain amount of doubloons--probably\r\ndishonestly--and is now a sort of Captain of Industry, manager of some\r\nbank or other, and about to stand for Parliament. The result of these\r\nexcesses is that my pater's imagination has been fired, and at time of\r\ngoing to press he wants me to imitate Comrade Bickersdyke. However,\r\nthere's plenty of time. That's one comfort. He's certain to change his\r\nmind again. Ready? Then suppose we filter forth into the arena?'\r\n\r\nOut on the field Mike was introduced to the man of hobbies. Mr Smith,\r\nsenior, was a long, earnest-looking man who might have been Psmith in a\r\ngrey wig but for his obvious energy. He was as wholly on the move as\r\nPsmith was wholly statuesque. Where Psmith stood like some dignified\r\npiece of sculpture, musing on deep questions with a glassy eye, his\r\nfather would be trying to be in four places at once. When Psmith\r\npresented Mike to him, he shook hands warmly with him and started a\r\nsentence, but broke off in the middle of both performances to dash\r\nwildly in the direction of the pavilion in an endeavour to catch an\r\nimpossible catch some thirty yards away. The impetus so gained carried\r\nhim on towards Bagley, the Ilsworth Hall ground-man, with whom a moment\r\nlater he was carrying on an animated discussion as to whether he had or\r\nhad not seen a dandelion on the field that morning. Two minutes\r\nafterwards he had skimmed away again. Mike, as he watched him, began to\r\nappreciate Psmith's reasons for feeling some doubt as to what would be\r\nhis future walk in life.\r\n\r\nAt lunch that day Mike sat next to Mr Smith, and improved his\r\nacquaintance with him; and by the end of the week they were on\r\nexcellent terms. Psmith's father had Psmith's gift of getting on well\r\nwith people.\r\n\r\nOn this Saturday, as Mike buckled on his pads, Mr Smith bounded up,\r\nfull of advice and encouragement.\r\n\r\n'My boy,' he said, 'we rely on you. These others'--he indicated with a\r\ndisparaging wave of the hand the rest of the team, who were visible\r\nthrough the window of the changing-room--'are all very well. Decent\r\nclub bats. Good for a few on a billiard-table. But you're our hope on a\r\nwicket like this. I have studied cricket all my life'--till that summer\r\nit is improbable that Mr Smith had ever handled a bat--'and I know a\r\nfirst-class batsman when I see one. I've seen your brothers play. Pooh,\r\nyou're better than any of them. That century of yours against the Green\r\nJackets was a wonderful innings, wonderful. Now look here, my boy. I\r\nwant you to be careful. We've a lot of runs to make, so we mustn't take\r\nany risks. Hit plenty of boundaries, of course, but be careful.\r\nCareful. Dash it, there's a youngster trying to climb up the elm. He'll\r\nbreak his neck. It's young Giles, my keeper's boy. Hi! Hi, there!'\r\n\r\nHe scudded out to avert the tragedy, leaving Mike to digest his expert\r\nadvice on the art of batting on bad wickets.\r\n\r\nPossibly it was the excellence of this advice which induced Mike to\r\nplay what was, to date, the best innings of his life. There are moments\r\nwhen the batsman feels an almost super-human fitness. This came to Mike\r\nnow. The sun had begun to shine strongly. It made the wicket more\r\ndifficult, but it added a cheerful touch to the scene. Mike felt calm\r\nand masterful. The bowling had no terrors for him. He scored nine off\r\nhis first over and seven off his second, half-way through which he lost\r\nhis partner. He was to undergo a similar bereavement several times that\r\nafternoon, and at frequent intervals. However simple the bowling might\r\nseem to him, it had enough sting in it to worry the rest of the team\r\nconsiderably. Batsmen came and went at the other end with such rapidity\r\nthat it seemed hardly worth while their troubling to come in at all.\r\nEvery now and then one would give promise of better things by lifting\r\nthe slow bowler into the pavilion or over the boundary, but it always\r\nhappened that a similar stroke, a few balls later, ended in an easy\r\ncatch. At five o'clock the Ilsworth score was eighty-one for seven\r\nwickets, last man nought, Mike not out fifty-nine. As most of the house\r\nteam, including Mike, were dispersing to their homes or were due for\r\nvisits at other houses that night, stumps were to be drawn at six. It\r\nwas obvious that they could not hope to win. Number nine on the list,\r\nwho was Bagley, the ground-man, went in with instructions to play for a\r\ndraw, and minute advice from Mr Smith as to how he was to do it. Mike\r\nhad now begun to score rapidly, and it was not to be expected that he\r\ncould change his game; but Bagley, a dried-up little man of the type\r\nwhich bowls for five hours on a hot August day without exhibiting any\r\nsymptoms of fatigue, put a much-bound bat stolidly in front of every\r\nball he received; and the Hall's prospects of saving the game grew\r\nbrighter.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to six the professional left, caught at very silly point\r\nfor eight. The score was a hundred and fifteen, of which Mike had made\r\neighty-five.\r\n\r\nA lengthy young man with yellow hair, who had done some good fast\r\nbowling for the Hall during the week, was the next man in. In previous\r\nmatches he had hit furiously at everything, and against the Green\r\nJackets had knocked up forty in twenty minutes while Mike was putting\r\nthe finishing touches to his century. Now, however, with his host's\r\nwarning ringing in his ears, he adopted the unspectacular, or Bagley,\r\nstyle of play. His manner of dealing with the ball was that of one\r\nplaying croquet. He patted it gingerly back to the bowler when it was\r\nstraight, and left it icily alone when it was off the wicket. Mike,\r\nstill in the brilliant vein, clumped a half-volley past point to the\r\nboundary, and with highly scientific late cuts and glides brought his\r\nscore to ninety-eight. With Mike's score at this, the total at a\r\nhundred and thirty, and the hands of the clock at five minutes to six,\r\nthe yellow-haired croquet exponent fell, as Bagley had fallen, a victim\r\nto silly point, the ball being the last of the over.\r\n\r\nMr Smith, who always went in last for his side, and who so far had not\r\nreceived a single ball during the week, was down the pavilion steps and\r\nhalf-way to the wicket before the retiring batsman had taken half a\r\ndozen steps.\r\n\r\n'Last over,' said the wicket-keeper to Mike. 'Any idea how many you've\r\ngot? You must be near your century, I should think.'\r\n\r\n'Ninety-eight,' said Mike. He always counted his runs.\r\n\r\n'By Jove, as near as that? This is something like a finish.'\r\n\r\nMike left the first ball alone, and the second. They were too wide of\r\nthe off-stump to be hit at safely. Then he felt a thrill as the third\r\nball left the bowler's hand. It was a long-hop. He faced square to pull\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment Mr John Bickersdyke walked into his life across the\r\nbowling-screen.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the bowler's arm just before the ball pitched. Mike lost\r\nsight of it for a fraction of a second, and hit wildly. The next moment\r\nhis leg stump was askew; and the Hall had lost the match.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' he said to Mr Smith. 'Some silly idiot walked across the\r\nscreen just as the ball was bowled.'\r\n\r\n'What!' shouted Mr Smith. 'Who was the fool who walked behind the\r\nbowler's arm?' he yelled appealingly to Space.\r\n\r\n'Here he comes, whoever he is,' said Mike.\r\n\r\nA short, stout man in a straw hat and a flannel suit was walking\r\ntowards them. As he came nearer Mike saw that he had a hard, thin-lipped\r\nmouth, half-hidden by a rather ragged moustache, and that behind a pair\r\nof gold spectacles were two pale and slightly protruding eyes, which,\r\nlike his mouth, looked hard.\r\n\r\n'How are you, Smith,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Bickersdyke.' There was a slight internal struggle, and then Mr\r\nSmith ceased to be the cricketer and became the host. He chatted\r\namiably to the new-comer.\r\n\r\n'You lost the game, I suppose,' said Mr Bickersdyke.\r\n\r\nThe cricketer in Mr Smith came to the top again, blended now, however,\r\nwith the host. He was annoyed, but restrained in his annoyance.\r\n\r\n'I say, Bickersdyke, you know, my dear fellow,' he said complainingly,\r\n'you shouldn't have walked across the screen. You put Jackson off, and\r\nmade him get bowled.'\r\n\r\n'The screen?'\r\n\r\n'That curious white object,' said Mike. 'It is not put up merely as an\r\nornament. There's a sort of rough idea of giving the batsman a chance\r\nof seeing the ball, as well. It's a great help to him when people come\r\ncharging across it just as the bowler bowls.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke turned a slightly deeper shade of purple, and was about\r\nto reply, when what sporting reporters call 'the veritable ovation'\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nQuite a large crowd had been watching the game, and they expressed\r\ntheir approval of Mike's performance.\r\n\r\nThere is only one thing for a batsman to do on these occasions. Mike\r\nran into the pavilion, leaving Mr Bickersdyke standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Mike Hears Bad News\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Mike, when he got home, that there was a touch of gloom in\r\nthe air. His sisters were as glad to see him as ever. There was a good\r\ndeal of rejoicing going on among the female Jacksons because Joe had\r\nscored his first double century in first-class cricket. Double\r\ncenturies are too common, nowadays, for the papers to take much notice\r\nof them; but, still, it is not everybody who can make them, and the\r\noccasion was one to be marked. Mike had read the news in the evening\r\npaper in the train, and had sent his brother a wire from the station,\r\ncongratulating him. He had wondered whether he himself would ever\r\nachieve the feat in first-class cricket. He did not see why he should\r\nnot. He looked forward through a long vista of years of county cricket.\r\nHe had a birth qualification for the county in which Mr Smith had\r\nsettled, and he had played for it once already at the beginning of the\r\nholidays. His _debut_ had not been sensational, but it had been\r\npromising. The fact that two members of the team had made centuries,\r\nand a third seventy odd, had rather eclipsed his own twenty-nine not\r\nout; but it had been a faultless innings, and nearly all the papers had\r\nsaid that here was yet another Jackson, evidently well up to the family\r\nstandard, who was bound to do big things in the future.\r\n\r\nThe touch of gloom was contributed by his brother Bob to a certain\r\nextent, and by his father more noticeably. Bob looked slightly\r\nthoughtful. Mr Jackson seemed thoroughly worried.\r\n\r\nMike approached Bob on the subject in the billiard-room after dinner.\r\nBob was practising cannons in rather a listless way.\r\n\r\n'What's up, Bob?' asked Mike.\r\n\r\nBob laid down his cue.\r\n\r\n'I'm hanged if I know,' said Bob. 'Something seems to be. Father's\r\nworried about something.'\r\n\r\n'He looked as if he'd got the hump rather at dinner.'\r\n\r\n'I only got here this afternoon, about three hours before you did. I\r\nhad a bit of a talk with him before dinner. I can't make out what's up.\r\nHe seemed awfully keen on my finding something to do now I've come down\r\nfrom Oxford. Wanted to know whether I couldn't get a tutoring job or a\r\nmastership at some school next term. I said I'd have a shot. I don't\r\nsee what all the hurry's about, though. I was hoping he'd give me a bit\r\nof travelling on the Continent somewhere before I started in.'\r\n\r\n'Rough luck,' said Mike. 'I wonder why it is. Jolly good about Joe,\r\nwasn't it? Let's have fifty up, shall we?'\r\n\r\nBob's remarks had given Mike no hint of impending disaster. It seemed\r\nstrange, of course, that his father, who had always been so easy-going,\r\nshould have developed a hustling Get On or Get Out spirit, and be\r\nurging Bob to Do It Now; but it never occurred to him that there could\r\nbe any serious reason for it. After all, fellows had to start working\r\nsome time or other. Probably his father had merely pointed this out to\r\nBob, and Bob had made too much of it.\r\n\r\nHalf-way through the game Mr Jackson entered the room, and stood\r\nwatching in silence.\r\n\r\n'Want a game, father?' asked Mike.\r\n\r\n'No, thanks, Mike. What is it? A hundred up?'\r\n\r\n'Fifty.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, then you'll be finished in a moment. When you are, I wish you'd\r\njust look into the study for a moment, Mike. I want to have a talk with\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'Rum,' said Mike, as the door closed. 'I wonder what's up?'\r\n\r\nFor a wonder his conscience was free. It was not as if a bad school-report\r\nmight have arrived in his absence. His Sedleigh report had come at\r\nthe beginning of the holidays, and had been, on the whole, fairly\r\ndecent--nothing startling either way. Mr Downing, perhaps through\r\nremorse at having harried Mike to such an extent during the Sammy\r\nepisode, had exercised a studied moderation in his remarks. He had let\r\nMike down far more easily than he really deserved. So it could not be a\r\nreport that was worrying Mr Jackson. And there was nothing else on his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nBob made a break of sixteen, and ran out. Mike replaced his cue, and\r\nwalked to the study.\r\n\r\nHis father was sitting at the table. Except for the very important fact\r\nthat this time he felt that he could plead Not Guilty on every possible\r\ncharge, Mike was struck by the resemblance in the general arrangement\r\nof the scene to that painful ten minutes at the end of the previous\r\nholidays, when his father had announced his intention of taking him\r\naway from Wrykyn and sending him to Sedleigh. The resemblance was\r\nincreased by the fact that, as Mike entered, Mr Jackson was kicking at\r\nthe waste-paper basket--a thing which with him was an infallible sign\r\nof mental unrest.\r\n\r\n'Sit down, Mike,' said Mr Jackson. 'How did you get on during the\r\nweek?'\r\n\r\n'Topping. Only once out under double figures. And then I was run out.\r\nGot a century against the Green Jackets, seventy-one against the\r\nIncogs, and today I made ninety-eight on a beast of a wicket, and only\r\ngot out because some silly goat of a chap--'\r\n\r\nHe broke off. Mr Jackson did not seem to be attending. There was a\r\nsilence. Then Mr Jackson spoke with an obvious effort.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Mike, we've always understood one another, haven't we?'\r\n\r\n'Of course we have.'\r\n\r\n'You know I wouldn't do anything to prevent you having a good time, if\r\nI could help it. I took you away from Wrykyn, I know, but that was a\r\nspecial case. It was necessary. But I understand perfectly how keen you\r\nare to go to Cambridge, and I wouldn't stand in the way for a minute,\r\nif I could help it.'\r\n\r\nMike looked at him blankly. This could only mean one thing. He was not\r\nto go to the 'Varsity. But why? What had happened? When he had left for\r\nthe Smith's cricket week, his name had been down for King's, and the\r\nwhole thing settled. What could have happened since then?\r\n\r\n'But I can't help it,' continued Mr Jackson.\r\n\r\n'Aren't I going up to Cambridge, father?' stammered Mike.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid not, Mike. I'd manage it if I possibly could. I'm just as\r\nanxious to see you get your Blue as you are to get it. But it's kinder\r\nto be quite frank. I can't afford to send you to Cambridge. I won't go\r\ninto details which you would not understand; but I've lost a very large\r\nsum of money since I saw you last. So large that we shall have to\r\neconomize in every way. I shall let this house and take a much smaller\r\none. And you and Bob, I'm afraid, will have to start earning your\r\nliving. I know it's a terrible disappointment to you, old chap.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that's all right,' said Mike thickly. There seemed to be something\r\nsticking in his throat, preventing him from speaking.\r\n\r\n'If there was any possible way--'\r\n\r\n'No, it's all right, father, really. I don't mind a bit. It's awfully\r\nrough luck on you losing all that.'\r\n\r\nThere was another silence. The clock ticked away energetically on the\r\nmantelpiece, as if glad to make itself heard at last. Outside, a\r\nplaintive snuffle made itself heard. John, the bull-dog, Mike's\r\ninseparable companion, who had followed him to the study, was getting\r\ntired of waiting on the mat. Mike got up and opened the door. John\r\nlumbered in.\r\n\r\nThe movement broke the tension.\r\n\r\n'Thanks, Mike,' said Mr Jackson, as Mike started to leave the room,\r\n'you're a sportsman.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The New Era Begins\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails of what were in store for him were given to Mike next morning.\r\nDuring his absence at Ilsworth a vacancy had been got for him in that\r\nflourishing institution, the New Asiatic Bank; and he was to enter upon\r\nhis duties, whatever they might be, on the Tuesday of the following\r\nweek. It was short notice, but banks have a habit of swallowing their\r\nvictims rather abruptly. Mike remembered the case of Wyatt, who had had\r\njust about the same amount of time in which to get used to the prospect\r\nof Commerce.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning a letter arrived from Psmith. Psmith was still\r\nperturbed. 'Commerce,' he wrote, 'continues to boom. My pater referred\r\nto Comrade Bickersdyke last night as a Merchant Prince. Comrade B. and\r\nI do not get on well together. Purely for his own good, I drew him\r\naside yesterday and explained to him at great length the frightfulness\r\nof walking across the bowling-screen. He seemed restive, but I was\r\nfirm. We parted rather with the Distant Stare than the Friendly Smile.\r\nBut I shall persevere. In many ways the casual observer would say that\r\nhe was hopeless. He is a poor performer at Bridge, as I was compelled\r\nto hint to him on Saturday night. His eyes have no animated sparkle of\r\nintelligence. And the cut of his clothes jars my sensitive soul to its\r\nfoundations. I don't wish to speak ill of a man behind his back, but I\r\nmust confide in you, as my Boyhood's Friend, that he wore a made-up tie\r\nat dinner. But no more of a painful subject. I am working away at him\r\nwith a brave smile. Sometimes I think that I am succeeding. Then he\r\nseems to slip back again. However,' concluded the letter, ending on an\r\noptimistic note, 'I think that I shall make a man of him yet--some\r\nday.'\r\n\r\nMike re-read this letter in the train that took him to London. By this\r\ntime Psmith would know that his was not the only case in which Commerce\r\nwas booming. Mike had written to him by return, telling him of the\r\ndisaster which had befallen the house of Jackson. Mike wished he could\r\nhave told him in person, for Psmith had a way of treating unpleasant\r\nsituations as if he were merely playing at them for his own amusement.\r\nPsmith's attitude towards the slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune\r\nwas to regard them with a bland smile, as if they were part of an\r\nentertainment got up for his express benefit.\r\n\r\nArriving at Paddington, Mike stood on the platform, waiting for his box\r\nto emerge from the luggage-van, with mixed feelings of gloom and\r\nexcitement. The gloom was in the larger quantities, perhaps, but the\r\nexcitement was there, too. It was the first time in his life that he\r\nhad been entirely dependent on himself. He had crossed the Rubicon. The\r\noccasion was too serious for him to feel the same helplessly furious\r\nfeeling with which he had embarked on life at Sedleigh. It was possible\r\nto look on Sedleigh with quite a personal enmity. London was too big to\r\nbe angry with. It took no notice of him. It did not care whether he was\r\nglad to be there or sorry, and there was no means of making it care.\r\nThat is the peculiarity of London. There is a sort of cold\r\nunfriendliness about it. A city like New York makes the new arrival\r\nfeel at home in half an hour; but London is a specialist in what Psmith\r\nin his letter had called the Distant Stare. You have to buy London's\r\ngood-will.\r\n\r\nMike drove across the Park to Victoria, feeling very empty and small.\r\nHe had settled on Dulwich as the spot to get lodgings, partly because,\r\nknowing nothing about London, he was under the impression that rooms\r\nanywhere inside the four-mile radius were very expensive, but\r\nprincipally because there was a school at Dulwich, and it would be a\r\ncomfort being near a school. He might get a game of fives there\r\nsometimes, he thought, on a Saturday afternoon, and, in the summer,\r\noccasional cricket.\r\n\r\nWandering at a venture up the asphalt passage which leads from Dulwich\r\nstation in the direction of the College, he came out into Acacia Road.\r\nThere is something about Acacia Road which inevitably suggests\r\nfurnished apartments. A child could tell at a glance that it was\r\nbristling with bed-sitting rooms.\r\n\r\nMike knocked at the first door over which a card hung.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no more depressing experience in the world than the\r\nprocess of engaging furnished apartments. Those who let furnished\r\napartments seem to take no joy in the act. Like Pooh-Bah, they do it,\r\nbut it revolts them.\r\n\r\nIn answer to Mike's knock, a female person opened the door. In\r\nappearance she resembled a pantomime 'dame', inclining towards the\r\nrestrained melancholy of Mr Wilkie Bard rather than the joyous abandon\r\nof Mr George Robey. Her voice she had modelled on the gramophone. Her\r\nmost recent occupation seemed to have been something with a good deal\r\nof yellow soap in it. As a matter of fact--there are no secrets between\r\nour readers and ourselves--she had been washing a shirt. A useful\r\noccupation, and an honourable, but one that tends to produce a certain\r\nhomeliness in the appearance.\r\n\r\nShe wiped a pair of steaming hands on her apron, and regarded Mike with\r\nan eye which would have been markedly expressionless in a boiled fish.\r\n\r\n'Was there anything?' she asked.\r\n\r\nMike felt that he was in for it now. He had not sufficient ease of\r\nmanner to back gracefully away and disappear, so he said that there was\r\nsomething. In point of fact, he wanted a bed-sitting room.\r\n\r\n'Orkup stays,' said the pantomime dame. Which Mike interpreted to mean,\r\nwould he walk upstairs?\r\n\r\nThe procession moved up a dark flight of stairs until it came to a\r\ndoor. The pantomime dame opened this, and shuffled through. Mike stood\r\nin the doorway, and looked in.\r\n\r\nIt was a repulsive room. One of those characterless rooms which are\r\nonly found in furnished apartments. To Mike, used to the comforts of\r\nhis bedroom at home and the cheerful simplicity of a school dormitory,\r\nit seemed about the most dismal spot he had ever struck. A sort of\r\nSargasso Sea among bedrooms.\r\n\r\nHe looked round in silence. Then he said: 'Yes.' There did not seem\r\nmuch else to say.\r\n\r\n'It's a nice room,' said the pantomime dame. Which was a black lie. It\r\nwas not a nice room. It never had been a nice room. And it did not seem\r\nat all probable that it ever would be a nice room. But it looked cheap.\r\nThat was the great thing. Nobody could have the assurance to charge\r\nmuch for a room like that. A landlady with a conscience might even have\r\ngone to the length of paying people some small sum by way of\r\ncompensation to them for sleeping in it.\r\n\r\n'About what?' queried Mike. Cheapness was the great consideration. He\r\nunderstood that his salary at the bank would be about four pounds ten a\r\nmonth, to begin with, and his father was allowing him five pounds a\r\nmonth. One does not do things _en prince_ on a hundred and\r\nfourteen pounds a year.\r\n\r\nThe pantomime dame became slightly more animated. Prefacing her remarks\r\nby a repetition of her statement that it was a nice room, she went on\r\nto say that she could 'do' it at seven and sixpence per week 'for\r\nhim'--giving him to understand, presumably, that, if the Shah of Persia\r\nor Mr Carnegie ever applied for a night's rest, they would sigh in vain\r\nfor such easy terms. And that included lights. Coals were to be looked\r\non as an extra. 'Sixpence a scuttle.' Attendance was thrown in.\r\n\r\nHaving stated these terms, she dribbled a piece of fluff under the bed,\r\nafter the manner of a professional Association footballer, and relapsed\r\ninto her former moody silence.\r\n\r\nMike said he thought that would be all right. The pantomime dame\r\nexhibited no pleasure.\r\n\r\n''Bout meals?' she said. 'You'll be wanting breakfast. Bacon, aigs,\r\nan' that, I suppose?'\r\n\r\nMike said he supposed so.\r\n\r\n'That'll be extra,' she said. 'And dinner? A chop, or a nice steak?'\r\n\r\nMike bowed before this original flight of fancy. A chop or a nice steak\r\nseemed to be about what he might want.\r\n\r\n'That'll be extra,' said the pantomime dame in her best Wilkie Bard\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nMike said yes, he supposed so. After which, having put down seven and\r\nsixpence, one week's rent in advance, he was presented with a grubby\r\nreceipt and an enormous latchkey, and the _seance_ was at an end.\r\nMike wandered out of the house. A few steps took him to the railings\r\nthat bounded the College grounds. It was late August, and the evenings\r\nhad begun to close in. The cricket-field looked very cool and spacious\r\nin the dim light, with the school buildings looming vague and shadowy\r\nthrough the slight mist. The little gate by the railway bridge was not\r\nlocked. He went in, and walked slowly across the turf towards the big\r\nclump of trees which marked the division between the cricket and\r\nfootball fields. It was all very pleasant and soothing after the\r\npantomime dame and her stuffy bed-sitting room. He sat down on a bench\r\nbeside the second eleven telegraph-board, and looked across the ground\r\nat the pavilion. For the first time that day he began to feel really\r\nhome-sick. Up till now the excitement of a strange venture had borne\r\nhim up; but the cricket-field and the pavilion reminded him so sharply\r\nof Wrykyn. They brought home to him with a cutting distinctness, the\r\nabsolute finality of his break with the old order of things. Summers\r\nwould come and go, matches would be played on this ground with all the\r\nglory of big scores and keen finishes; but he was done. 'He was a jolly\r\ngood bat at school. Top of the Wrykyn averages two years. But didn't do\r\nanything after he left. Went into the city or something.' That was what\r\nthey would say of him, if they didn't quite forget him.\r\n\r\nThe clock on the tower over the senior block chimed quarter after\r\nquarter, but Mike sat on, thinking. It was quite late when he got up,\r\nand began to walk back to Acacia Road. He felt cold and stiff and very\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. First Steps in a Business Career\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City received Mike with the same aloofness with which the more\r\nwestern portion of London had welcomed him on the previous day. Nobody\r\nseemed to look at him. He was permitted to alight at St Paul's and make\r\nhis way up Queen Victoria Street without any demonstration. He followed\r\nthe human stream till he reached the Mansion House, and eventually\r\nfound himself at the massive building of the New Asiatic Bank, Limited.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty now was to know how to make an effective entrance. There\r\nwas the bank, and here was he. How had he better set about breaking it\r\nto the authorities that he had positively arrived and was ready to\r\nstart earning his four pound ten _per mensem_? Inside, the bank\r\nseemed to be in a state of some confusion. Men were moving about in an\r\napparently irresolute manner. Nobody seemed actually to be working. As\r\na matter of fact, the business of a bank does not start very early in\r\nthe morning. Mike had arrived before things had really begun to move.\r\nAs he stood near the doorway, one or two panting figures rushed up the\r\nsteps, and flung themselves at a large book which stood on the counter\r\nnear the door. Mike was to come to know this book well. In it, if you\r\nwere an _employe_ of the New Asiatic Bank, you had to inscribe\r\nyour name every morning. It was removed at ten sharp to the\r\naccountant's room, and if you reached the bank a certain number of\r\ntimes in the year too late to sign, bang went your bonus.\r\n\r\nAfter a while things began to settle down. The stir and confusion\r\ngradually ceased. All down the length of the bank, figures could be\r\nseen, seated on stools and writing hieroglyphics in large letters. A\r\nbenevolent-looking man, with spectacles and a straggling grey beard,\r\ncrossed the gangway close to where Mike was standing. Mike put the\r\nthing to him, as man to man.\r\n\r\n'Could you tell me,' he said, 'what I'm supposed to do? I've just\r\njoined the bank.' The benevolent man stopped, and looked at him with a\r\npair of mild blue eyes. 'I think, perhaps, that your best plan would be\r\nto see the manager,' he said. 'Yes, I should certainly do that. He will\r\ntell you what work you have to do. If you will permit me, I will show\r\nyou the way.'\r\n\r\n'It's awfully good of you,' said Mike. He felt very grateful. After his\r\nexperience of London, it was a pleasant change to find someone who\r\nreally seemed to care what happened to him. His heart warmed to the\r\nbenevolent man.\r\n\r\n'It feels strange to you, perhaps, at first, Mr--'\r\n\r\n'Jackson.'\r\n\r\n'Mr Jackson. My name is Waller. I have been in the City some time, but\r\nI can still recall my first day. But one shakes down. One shakes down\r\nquite quickly. Here is the manager's room. If you go in, he will tell\r\nyou what to do.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks awfully,' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'Not at all.' He ambled off on the quest which Mike had interrupted,\r\nturning, as he went, to bestow a mild smile of encouragement on the new\r\narrival. There was something about Mr Waller which reminded Mike\r\npleasantly of the White Knight in 'Alice through the Looking-glass.'\r\n\r\nMike knocked at the managerial door, and went in.\r\n\r\nTwo men were sitting at the table. The one facing the door was writing\r\nwhen Mike went in. He continued to write all the time he was in the\r\nroom. Conversation between other people in his presence had apparently\r\nno interest for him, nor was it able to disturb him in any way.\r\n\r\nThe other man was talking into a telephone. Mike waited till he had\r\nfinished. Then he coughed. The man turned round. Mike had thought, as\r\nhe looked at his back and heard his voice, that something about his\r\nappearance or his way of speaking was familiar. He was right. The man\r\nin the chair was Mr Bickersdyke, the cross-screen pedestrian.\r\n\r\nThese reunions are very awkward. Mike was frankly unequal to the\r\nsituation. Psmith, in his place, would have opened the conversation,\r\nand relaxed the tension with some remark on the weather or the state of\r\nthe crops. Mike merely stood wrapped in silence, as in a garment.\r\n\r\nThat the recognition was mutual was evident from Mr Bickersdyke's look.\r\nBut apart from this, he gave no sign of having already had the pleasure\r\nof making Mike's acquaintance. He merely stared at him as if he were a\r\nblot on the arrangement of the furniture, and said, 'Well?'\r\n\r\nThe most difficult parts to play in real life as well as on the stage\r\nare those in which no 'business' is arranged for the performer. It was\r\nall very well for Mr Bickersdyke. He had been 'discovered sitting'. But\r\nMike had had to enter, and he wished now that there was something he\r\ncould do instead of merely standing and speaking.\r\n\r\n'I've come,' was the best speech he could think of. It was not a good\r\nspeech. It was too sinister. He felt that even as he said it. It was\r\nthe sort of thing Mephistopheles would have said to Faust by way of\r\nopening conversation. And he was not sure, either, whether he ought not\r\nto have added, 'Sir.'\r\n\r\nApparently such subtleties of address were not necessary, for Mr\r\nBickersdyke did not start up and shout, 'This language to me!' or\r\nanything of that kind. He merely said, 'Oh! And who are you?'\r\n\r\n'Jackson,' said Mike. It was irritating, this assumption on Mr\r\nBickersdyke's part that they had never met before.\r\n\r\n'Jackson? Ah, yes. You have joined the staff?'\r\n\r\nMike rather liked this way of putting it. It lent a certain dignity to\r\nthe proceedings, making him feel like some important person for whose\r\nservices there had been strenuous competition. He seemed to see the\r\nbank's directors being reassured by the chairman. ('I am happy to say,\r\ngentlemen, that our profits for the past year are 3,000,006-2-2 1/2\r\npounds--(cheers)--and'--impressively--'that we have finally succeeded\r\nin inducing Mr Mike Jackson--(sensation)--to--er--in fact, to join the\r\nstaff!' (Frantic cheers, in which the chairman joined.)\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he said.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke pressed a bell on the table beside him, and picking up a\r\npen, began to write. Of Mike he took no further notice, leaving that\r\ntoy of Fate standing stranded in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments one of the men in fancy dress, whom Mike had seen\r\nhanging about the gangway, and whom he afterwards found to be\r\nmessengers, appeared. Mr Bickersdyke looked up.\r\n\r\n'Ask Mr Bannister to step this way,' he said.\r\n\r\nThe messenger disappeared, and presently the door opened again to admit\r\na shock-headed youth with paper cuff-protectors round his wrists.\r\n\r\n'This is Mr Jackson, a new member of the staff. He will take your place\r\nin the postage department. You will go into the cash department, under\r\nMr Waller. Kindly show him what he has to do.'\r\n\r\nMike followed Mr Bannister out. On the other side of the door the\r\nshock-headed one became communicative.\r\n\r\n'Whew!' he said, mopping his brow. 'That's the sort of thing which\r\ngives me the pip. When William came and said old Bick wanted to see me,\r\nI said to him, \"William, my boy, my number is up. This is the sack.\" I\r\nmade certain that Rossiter had run me in for something. He's been\r\nwaiting for a chance to do it for weeks, only I've been as good as gold\r\nand haven't given it him. I pity you going into the postage. There's\r\none thing, though. If you can stick it for about a month, you'll get\r\nthrough all right. Men are always leaving for the East, and then you\r\nget shunted on into another department, and the next new man goes into\r\nthe postage. That's the best of this place. It's not like one of those\r\nbanks where you stay in London all your life. You only have three years\r\nhere, and then you get your orders, and go to one of the branches in\r\nthe East, where you're the dickens of a big pot straight away, with a\r\nbig screw and a dozen native Johnnies under you. Bit of all right,\r\nthat. I shan't get my orders for another two and a half years and more,\r\nworse luck. Still, it's something to look forward to.'\r\n\r\n'Who's Rossiter?' asked Mike.\r\n\r\n'The head of the postage department. Fussy little brute. Won't leave\r\nyou alone. Always trying to catch you on the hop. There's one thing,\r\nthough. The work in the postage is pretty simple. You can't make many\r\nmistakes, if you're careful. It's mostly entering letters and stamping\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\nThey turned in at the door in the counter, and arrived at a desk which\r\nran parallel to the gangway. There was a high rack running along it, on\r\nwhich were several ledgers. Tall, green-shaded electric lamps gave it\r\nrather a cosy look.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the desk, a little man with short, black whiskers\r\nbuzzed out from behind a glass screen, where there was another desk.\r\n\r\n'Where have you been, Bannister, where have you been? You must not\r\nleave your work in this way. There are several letters waiting to be\r\nentered. Where have you been?'\r\n\r\n'Mr Bickersdyke sent for me,' said Bannister, with the calm triumph of\r\none who trumps an ace.\r\n\r\n'Oh! Ah! Oh! Yes, very well. I see. But get to work, get to work. Who\r\nis this?'\r\n\r\n'This is a new man. He's taking my place. I've been moved on to the\r\ncash.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! Ah! Is your name Smith?' asked Mr Rossiter, turning to Mike.\r\n\r\nMike corrected the rash guess, and gave his name. It struck him as a\r\ncurious coincidence that he should be asked if his name were Smith, of\r\nall others. Not that it is an uncommon name.\r\n\r\n'Mr Bickersdyke told me to expect a Mr Smith. Well, well, perhaps there\r\nare two new men. Mr Bickersdyke knows we are short-handed in this\r\ndepartment. But, come along, Bannister, come along. Show Jackson what\r\nhe has to do. We must get on. There is no time to waste.'\r\n\r\nHe buzzed back to his lair. Bannister grinned at Mike. He was a\r\ncheerful youth. His normal expression was a grin.\r\n\r\n'That's a sample of Rossiter,' he said. 'You'd think from the fuss he's\r\nmade that the business of the place was at a standstill till we got to\r\nwork. Perfect rot! There's never anything to do here till after lunch,\r\nexcept checking the stamps and petty cash, and I've done that ages ago.\r\nThere are three letters. You may as well enter them. It all looks like\r\nwork. But you'll find the best way is to wait till you get a couple of\r\ndozen or so, and then work them off in a batch. But if you see Rossiter\r\nabout, then start stamping something or writing something, or he'll run\r\nyou in for neglecting your job. He's a nut. I'm jolly glad I'm under\r\nold Waller now. He's the pick of the bunch. The other heads of\r\ndepartments are all nuts, and Bickersdyke's the nuttiest of the lot.\r\nNow, look here. This is all you've got to do. I'll just show you, and\r\nthen you can manage for yourself. I shall have to be shunting off to my\r\nown work in a minute.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Other Man\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Bannister had said, the work in the postage department was not\r\nintricate. There was nothing much to do except enter and stamp letters,\r\nand, at intervals, take them down to the post office at the end of the\r\nstreet. The nature of the work gave Mike plenty of time for reflection.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts became gloomy again. All this was very far removed from\r\nthe life to which he had looked forward. There are some people who take\r\nnaturally to a life of commerce. Mike was not of these. To him the\r\nrestraint of the business was irksome. He had been used to an open-air\r\nlife, and a life, in its way, of excitement. He gathered that he would\r\nnot be free till five o'clock, and that on the following day he would\r\ncome at ten and go at five, and the same every day, except Saturdays\r\nand Sundays, all the year round, with a ten days' holiday. The monotony\r\nof the prospect appalled him. He was not old enough to know what a\r\nnarcotic is Habit, and that one can become attached to and interested\r\nin the most unpromising jobs. He worked away dismally at his letters\r\ntill he had finished them. Then there was nothing to do except sit and\r\nwait for more.\r\n\r\nHe looked through the letters he had stamped, and re-read the\r\naddresses. Some of them were directed to people living in the country,\r\none to a house which he knew quite well, near to his own home in\r\nShropshire. It made him home-sick, conjuring up visions of shady\r\ngardens and country sounds and smells, and the silver Severn gleaming\r\nin the distance through the trees. About now, if he were not in this\r\ndismal place, he would be lying in the shade in the garden with a book,\r\nor wandering down to the river to boat or bathe. That envelope\r\naddressed to the man in Shropshire gave him the worst moment he had\r\nexperienced that day.\r\n\r\nThe time crept slowly on to one o'clock. At two minutes past Mike awoke\r\nfrom a day-dream to find Mr Waller standing by his side. The cashier\r\nhad his hat on.\r\n\r\n'I wonder,' said Mr Waller, 'if you would care to come out to lunch. I\r\ngenerally go about this time, and Mr Rossiter, I know, does not go out\r\ntill two. I thought perhaps that, being unused to the City, you might\r\nhave some difficulty in finding your way about.'\r\n\r\n'It's awfully good of you,' said Mike. 'I should like to.'\r\n\r\nThe other led the way through the streets and down obscure alleys till\r\nthey came to a chop-house. Here one could have the doubtful pleasure of\r\nseeing one's chop in its various stages of evolution. Mr Waller ordered\r\nlunch with the care of one to whom lunch is no slight matter. Few\r\nworkers in the City do regard lunch as a trivial affair. It is the\r\nkeynote of their day. It is an oasis in a desert of ink and ledgers.\r\nConversation in city office deals, in the morning, with what one is\r\ngoing to have for lunch, and in the afternoon with what one has had for\r\nlunch.\r\n\r\nAt intervals during the meal Mr Waller talked. Mike was content to\r\nlisten. There was something soothing about the grey-bearded one.\r\n\r\n'What sort of a man is Bickersdyke?' asked Mike.\r\n\r\n'A very able man. A very able man indeed. I'm afraid he's not popular\r\nin the office. A little inclined, perhaps, to be hard on mistakes. I\r\ncan remember the time when he was quite different. He and I were fellow\r\nclerks in Morton and Blatherwick's. He got on better than I did. A\r\ngreat fellow for getting on. They say he is to be the Unionist\r\ncandidate for Kenningford when the time comes. A great worker, but\r\nperhaps not quite the sort of man to be generally popular in an\r\noffice.'\r\n\r\n'He's a blighter,' was Mike's verdict. Mr Waller made no comment. Mike\r\nwas to learn later that the manager and the cashier, despite the fact\r\nthat they had been together in less prosperous days--or possibly\r\nbecause of it--were not on very good terms. Mr Bickersdyke was a man of\r\nstrong prejudices, and he disliked the cashier, whom he looked down\r\nupon as one who had climbed to a lower rung of the ladder than he\r\nhimself had reached.\r\n\r\nAs the hands of the chop-house clock reached a quarter to two, Mr\r\nWaller rose, and led the way back to the office, where they parted for\r\ntheir respective desks. Gratitude for any good turn done to him was a\r\nleading characteristic of Mike's nature, and he felt genuinely grateful\r\nto the cashier for troubling to seek him out and be friendly to him.\r\n\r\nHis three-quarters-of-an-hour absence had led to the accumulation of a\r\nsmall pile of letters on his desk. He sat down and began to work them\r\noff. The addresses continued to exercise a fascination for him. He was\r\nmiles away from the office, speculating on what sort of a man J. B.\r\nGarside, Esq, was, and whether he had a good time at his house in\r\nWorcestershire, when somebody tapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe looked up.\r\n\r\nStanding by his side, immaculately dressed as ever, with his eye-glass\r\nfixed and a gentle smile on his face, was Psmith.\r\n\r\nMike stared.\r\n\r\n'Commerce,' said Psmith, as he drew off his lavender gloves, 'has\r\nclaimed me for her own. Comrade of old, I, too, have joined this\r\nblighted institution.'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, there was a whirring noise in the immediate neighbourhood,\r\nand Mr Rossiter buzzed out from his den with the _esprit_ and\r\nanimation of a clock-work toy.\r\n\r\n'Who's here?' said Psmith with interest, removing his eye-glass,\r\npolishing it, and replacing it in his eye.\r\n\r\n'Mr Jackson,' exclaimed Mr Rossiter. 'I really must ask you to be good\r\nenough to come in from your lunch at the proper time. It was fully\r\nseven minutes to two when you returned, and--'\r\n\r\n'That little more,' sighed Psmith, 'and how much is it!'\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' snapped Mr Rossiter, turning on him.\r\n\r\n'I shall be delighted, Comrade--'\r\n\r\n'Rossiter,' said Mike, aside.\r\n\r\n'Comrade Rossiter. I shall be delighted to furnish you with particulars\r\nof my family history. As follows. Soon after the Norman Conquest, a\r\ncertain Sieur de Psmith grew tired of work--a family failing,\r\nalas!--and settled down in this country to live peacefully for the\r\nremainder of his life on what he could extract from the local\r\npeasantry. He may be described as the founder of the family which\r\nultimately culminated in Me. Passing on--'\r\n\r\nMr Rossiter refused to pass on.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing here? What have you come for?'\r\n\r\n'Work,' said Psmith, with simple dignity. 'I am now a member of the\r\nstaff of this bank. Its interests are my interests. Psmith, the\r\nindividual, ceases to exist, and there springs into being Psmith, the\r\ncog in the wheel of the New Asiatic Bank; Psmith, the link in the\r\nbank's chain; Psmith, the Worker. I shall not spare myself,' he\r\nproceeded earnestly. 'I shall toil with all the accumulated energy of\r\none who, up till now, has only known what work is like from hearsay.\r\nWhose is that form sitting on the steps of the bank in the morning,\r\nwaiting eagerly for the place to open? It is the form of Psmith, the\r\nWorker. Whose is that haggard, drawn face which bends over a ledger\r\nlong after the other toilers have sped blithely westwards to dine at\r\nLyons' Popular Cafe? It is the face of Psmith, the Worker.'\r\n\r\n'I--' began Mr Rossiter.\r\n\r\n'I tell you,' continued Psmith, waving aside the interruption and\r\ntapping the head of the department rhythmically in the region of the\r\nsecond waistcoat-button with a long finger, 'I tell _you_, Comrade\r\nRossiter, that you have got hold of a good man. You and I together, not\r\nforgetting Comrade Jackson, the pet of the Smart Set, will toil early\r\nand late till we boost up this Postage Department into a shining model\r\nof what a Postage Department should be. What that is, at present, I do\r\nnot exactly know. However. Excursion trains will be run from distant\r\nshires to see this Postage Department. American visitors to London will\r\ndo it before going on to the Tower. And now,' he broke off, with a\r\ncrisp, businesslike intonation, 'I must ask you to excuse me. Much as I\r\nhave enjoyed this little chat, I fear it must now cease. The time has\r\ncome to work. Our trade rivals are getting ahead of us. The whisper\r\ngoes round, \"Rossiter and Psmith are talking, not working,\" and other\r\nfirms prepare to pinch our business. Let me Work.'\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later, Mr Rossiter was sitting at his desk with a dazed\r\nexpression, while Psmith, perched gracefully on a stool, entered\r\nfigures in a ledger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Psmith Explains\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the space of about twenty-five minutes Psmith sat in silence,\r\nconcentrated on his ledger, the picture of the model bank-clerk. Then\r\nhe flung down his pen, slid from his stool with a satisfied sigh, and\r\ndusted his waistcoat. 'A commercial crisis,' he said, 'has passed. The\r\njob of work which Comrade Rossiter indicated for me has been completed\r\nwith masterly skill. The period of anxiety is over. The bank ceases to\r\ntotter. Are you busy, Comrade Jackson, or shall we chat awhile?'\r\n\r\nMike was not busy. He had worked off the last batch of letters, and\r\nthere was nothing to do but to wait for the next, or--happy thought--to\r\ntake the present batch down to the post, and so get out into the\r\nsunshine and fresh air for a short time. 'I rather think I'll nip down\r\nto the post-office,' said he, 'You couldn't come too, I suppose?'\r\n\r\n'On the contrary,' said Psmith, 'I could, and will. A stroll will just\r\nrestore those tissues which the gruelling work of the last half-hour\r\nhas wasted away. It is a fearful strain, this commercial toil. Let us\r\ntrickle towards the post office. I will leave my hat and gloves as a\r\nguarantee of good faith. The cry will go round, \"Psmith has gone! Some\r\nrival institution has kidnapped him!\" Then they will see my hat,'--he\r\nbuilt up a foundation of ledgers, planted a long ruler in the middle,\r\nand hung his hat on it--'my gloves,'--he stuck two pens into the desk\r\nand hung a lavender glove on each--'and they will sink back swooning\r\nwith relief. The awful suspense will be over. They will say, \"No, he\r\nhas not gone permanently. Psmith will return. When the fields are white\r\nwith daisies he'll return.\" And now, Comrade Jackson, lead me to this\r\npicturesque little post-office of yours of which I have heard so much.'\r\n\r\nMike picked up the long basket into which he had thrown the letters\r\nafter entering the addresses in his ledger, and they moved off down the\r\naisle. No movement came from Mr Rossiter's lair. Its energetic occupant\r\nwas hard at work. They could just see part of his hunched-up back.\r\n\r\n'I wish Comrade Downing could see us now,' said Psmith. 'He always set\r\nus down as mere idlers. Triflers. Butterflies. It would be a wholesome\r\ncorrective for him to watch us perspiring like this in the cause of\r\nCommerce.'\r\n\r\n'You haven't told me yet what on earth you're doing here,' said Mike.\r\n'I thought you were going to the 'Varsity. Why the dickens are you in a\r\nbank? Your pater hasn't lost his money, has he?'\r\n\r\n'No. There is still a tolerable supply of doubloons in the old oak\r\nchest. Mine is a painful story.'\r\n\r\n'It always is,' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'You are very right, Comrade Jackson. I am the victim of Fate. Ah, so\r\nyou put the little chaps in there, do you?' he said, as Mike, reaching\r\nthe post-office, began to bundle the letters into the box. 'You seem to\r\nhave grasped your duties with admirable promptitude. It is the same\r\nwith me. I fancy we are both born men of Commerce. In a few years we\r\nshall be pinching Comrade Bickersdyke's job. And talking of Comrade B.\r\nbrings me back to my painful story. But I shall never have time to tell\r\nit to you during our walk back. Let us drift aside into this tea-shop.\r\nWe can order a buckwheat cake or a butter-nut, or something equally\r\nsucculent, and carefully refraining from consuming these dainties, I\r\nwill tell you all.'\r\n\r\n'Right O!' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'When last I saw you,' resumed Psmith, hanging Mike's basket on the\r\nhat-stand and ordering two portions of porridge, 'you may remember that\r\na serious crisis in my affairs had arrived. My father inflamed with the\r\nidea of Commerce had invited Comrade Bickersdyke--'\r\n\r\n'When did you know he was a manager here?' asked Mike.\r\n\r\n'At an early date. I have my spies everywhere. However, my pater\r\ninvited Comrade Bickersdyke to our house for the weekend. Things turned\r\nout rather unfortunately. Comrade B. resented my purely altruistic\r\nefforts to improve him mentally and morally. Indeed, on one occasion he\r\nwent so far as to call me an impudent young cub, and to add that he\r\nwished he had me under him in his bank, where, he asserted, he would\r\nknock some of the nonsense out of me. All very painful. I tell you,\r\nComrade Jackson, for the moment it reduced my delicately vibrating\r\nganglions to a mere frazzle. Recovering myself, I made a few blithe\r\nremarks, and we then parted. I cannot say that we parted friends, but\r\nat any rate I bore him no ill-will. I was still determined to make him\r\na credit to me. My feelings towards him were those of some kindly\r\nfather to his prodigal son. But he, if I may say so, was fairly on the\r\nhop. And when my pater, after dinner the same night, played into his\r\nhands by mentioning that he thought I ought to plunge into a career of\r\ncommerce, Comrade B. was, I gather, all over him. Offered to make a\r\nvacancy for me in the bank, and to take me on at once. My pater,\r\nfeeling that this was the real hustle which he admired so much, had me\r\nin, stated his case, and said, in effect, \"How do we go?\" I intimated\r\nthat Comrade Bickersdyke was my greatest chum on earth. So the thing\r\nwas fixed up and here I am. But you are not getting on with your\r\nporridge, Comrade Jackson. Perhaps you don't care for porridge? Would\r\nyou like a finnan haddock, instead? Or a piece of shortbread? You have\r\nonly to say the word.'\r\n\r\n'It seems to me,' said Mike gloomily, 'that we are in for a pretty\r\nrotten time of it in this bally bank. If Bickersdyke's got his knife\r\ninto us, he can make it jolly warm for us. He's got his knife into me\r\nall right about that walking-across-the-screen business.'\r\n\r\n'True,' said Psmith, 'to a certain extent. It is an undoubted fact that\r\nComrade Bickersdyke will have a jolly good try at making life a\r\nnuisance to us; but, on the other hand, I propose, so far as in me\r\nlies, to make things moderately unrestful for him, here and there.'\r\n\r\n'But you can't,' objected Mike. 'What I mean to say is, it isn't like a\r\nschool. If you wanted to score off a master at school, you could always\r\nrag and so on. But here you can't. How can you rag a man who's sitting\r\nall day in a room of his own while you're sweating away at a desk at\r\nthe other end of the building?'\r\n\r\n'You put the case with admirable clearness, Comrade Jackson,' said\r\nPsmith approvingly. 'At the hard-headed, common-sense business you\r\nsneak the biscuit every time with ridiculous ease. But you do not know\r\nall. I do not propose to do a thing in the bank except work. I shall be\r\na model as far as work goes. I shall be flawless. I shall bound to do\r\nComrade Rossiter's bidding like a highly trained performing dog. It is\r\noutside the bank, when I have staggered away dazed with toil, that I\r\nshall resume my attention to the education of Comrade Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\n'But, dash it all, how can you? You won't see him. He'll go off home,\r\nor to his club, or--'\r\n\r\nPsmith tapped him earnestly on the chest.\r\n\r\n'There, Comrade Jackson,' he said, 'you have hit the bull's-eye, rung\r\nthe bell, and gathered in the cigar or cocoanut according to choice. He\r\n_will_ go off to his club. And I shall do precisely the same.'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'It is this way. My father, as you may have noticed during your stay at\r\nour stately home of England, is a man of a warm, impulsive character.\r\nHe does not always do things as other people would do them. He has his\r\nown methods. Thus, he has sent me into the City to do the hard-working,\r\nbank-clerk act, but at the same time he is allowing me just as large an\r\nallowance as he would have given me if I had gone to the 'Varsity.\r\nMoreover, while I was still at Eton he put my name up for his clubs,\r\nthe Senior Conservative among others. My pater belongs to four\r\nclubs altogether, and in course of time, when my name comes up for\r\nelection, I shall do the same. Meanwhile, I belong to one, the Senior\r\nConservative. It is a bigger club than the others, and your name comes\r\nup for election sooner. About the middle of last month a great yell of\r\njoy made the West End of London shake like a jelly. The three thousand\r\nmembers of the Senior Conservative had just learned that I had been\r\nelected.'\r\n\r\nPsmith paused, and ate some porridge.\r\n\r\n'I wonder why they call this porridge,' he observed with mild interest.\r\n'It would be far more manly and straightforward of them to give it its\r\nreal name. To resume. I have gleaned, from casual chit-chat with my\r\nfather, that Comrade Bickersdyke also infests the Senior Conservative.\r\nYou might think that that would make me, seeing how particular I am\r\nabout whom I mix with, avoid the club. Error. I shall go there every\r\nday. If Comrade Bickersdyke wishes to emend any little traits in my\r\ncharacter of which he may disapprove, he shall never say that I did not\r\ngive him the opportunity. I shall mix freely with Comrade Bickersdyke\r\nat the Senior Conservative Club. I shall be his constant companion. I\r\nshall, in short, haunt the man. By these strenuous means I shall, as it\r\nwere, get a bit of my own back. And now,' said Psmith, rising, 'it\r\nmight be as well, perhaps, to return to the bank and resume our\r\ncommercial duties. I don't know how long you are supposed to be allowed\r\nfor your little trips to and from the post-office, but, seeing that the\r\ndistance is about thirty yards, I should say at a venture not more than\r\nhalf an hour. Which is exactly the space of time which has flitted by\r\nsince we started out on this important expedition. Your devotion to\r\nporridge, Comrade Jackson, has led to our spending about twenty-five\r\nminutes in this hostelry.'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott,' said Mike, 'there'll be a row.'\r\n\r\n'Some slight temporary breeze, perhaps,' said Psmith. 'Annoying to men\r\nof culture and refinement, but not lasting. My only fear is lest we may\r\nhave worried Comrade Rossiter at all. I regard Comrade Rossiter as an\r\nelder brother, and would not cause him a moment's heart-burning for\r\nworlds. However, we shall soon know,' he added, as they passed into the\r\nbank and walked up the aisle, 'for there is Comrade Rossiter waiting to\r\nreceive us in person.'\r\n\r\nThe little head of the Postage Department was moving restlessly about\r\nin the neighbourhood of Psmith's and Mike's desk.\r\n\r\n'Am I mistaken,' said Psmith to Mike, 'or is there the merest suspicion\r\nof a worried look on our chief's face? It seems to me that there is the\r\nslightest soupcon of shadow about that broad, calm brow.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Going into Winter Quarters\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was.\r\n\r\nMr Rossiter had discovered Psmith's and Mike's absence about five\r\nminutes after they had left the building. Ever since then, he had been\r\npopping out of his lair at intervals of three minutes, to see whether\r\nthey had returned. Constant disappointment in this respect had rendered\r\nhim decidedly jumpy. When Psmith and Mike reached the desk, he was a\r\nkind of human soda-water bottle. He fizzed over with questions,\r\nreproofs, and warnings.\r\n\r\n'What does it mean? What does it mean?' he cried. 'Where have you been?\r\nWhere have you been?'\r\n\r\n'Poetry,' said Psmith approvingly.\r\n\r\n'You have been absent from your places for over half an hour. Why? Why?\r\nWhy? Where have you been? Where have you been? I cannot have this. It\r\nis preposterous. Where have you been? Suppose Mr Bickersdyke had\r\nhappened to come round here. I should not have known what to say to\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'Never an easy man to chat with, Comrade Bickersdyke,' agreed Psmith.\r\n\r\n'You must thoroughly understand that you are expected to remain in your\r\nplaces during business hours.'\r\n\r\n'Of course,' said Psmith, 'that makes it a little hard for Comrade\r\nJackson to post letters, does it not?'\r\n\r\n'Have you been posting letters?'\r\n\r\n'We have,' said Psmith. 'You have wronged us. Seeing our absent places\r\nyou jumped rashly to the conclusion that we were merely gadding about\r\nin pursuit of pleasure. Error. All the while we were furthering the\r\nbank's best interests by posting letters.'\r\n\r\n'You had no business to leave your place. Jackson is on the posting\r\ndesk.'\r\n\r\n'You are very right,' said Psmith, 'and it shall not occur again. It\r\nwas only because it was the first day, Comrade Jackson is not used to\r\nthe stir and bustle of the City. His nerve failed him. He shrank from\r\ngoing to the post-office alone. So I volunteered to accompany him.\r\nAnd,' concluded Psmith, impressively, 'we won safely through. Every\r\nletter has been posted.'\r\n\r\n'That need not have taken you half an hour.'\r\n\r\n'True. And the actual work did not. It was carried through swiftly and\r\nsurely. But the nerve-strain had left us shaken. Before resuming our\r\nmore ordinary duties we had to refresh. A brief breathing-space, a\r\nlittle coffee and porridge, and here we are, fit for work once more.'\r\n\r\n'If it occurs again, I shall report the matter to Mr Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\n'And rightly so,' said Psmith, earnestly. 'Quite rightly so.\r\nDiscipline, discipline. That is the cry. There must be no shirking of\r\npainful duties. Sentiment must play no part in business. Rossiter, the\r\nman, may sympathise, but Rossiter, the Departmental head, must be\r\nadamant.'\r\n\r\nMr Rossiter pondered over this for a moment, then went off on a\r\nside-issue.\r\n\r\n'What is the meaning of this foolery?' he asked, pointing to Psmith's\r\ngloves and hat. 'Suppose Mr Bickersdyke had come round and seen them,\r\nwhat should I have said?'\r\n\r\n'You would have given him a message of cheer. You would have said, \"All\r\nis well. Psmith has not left us. He will come back. And Comrade\r\nBickersdyke, relieved, would have--\"'\r\n\r\n'You do not seem very busy, Mr Smith.'\r\n\r\nBoth Psmith and Mr Rossiter were startled.\r\n\r\nMr Rossiter jumped as if somebody had run a gimlet into him, and even\r\nPsmith started slightly. They had not heard Mr Bickersdyke approaching.\r\nMike, who had been stolidly entering addresses in his ledger during the\r\nlatter part of the conversation, was also taken by surprise.\r\n\r\nPsmith was the first to recover. Mr Rossiter was still too confused for\r\nspeech, but Psmith took the situation in hand.\r\n\r\n'Apparently no,' he said, swiftly removing his hat from the ruler. 'In\r\nreality, yes. Mr Rossiter and I were just scheming out a line of work\r\nfor me as you came up. If you had arrived a moment later, you would\r\nhave found me toiling.'\r\n\r\n'H'm. I hope I should. We do not encourage idling in this bank.'\r\n\r\n'Assuredly not,' said Psmith warmly. 'Most assuredly not. I would not\r\nhave it otherwise. I am a worker. A bee, not a drone. A\r\n_Lusitania,_ not a limpet. Perhaps I have not yet that grip on my\r\nduties which I shall soon acquire; but it is coming. It is coming. I\r\nsee daylight.'\r\n\r\n'H'm. I have only your word for it.' He turned to Mr Rossiter, who had\r\nnow recovered himself, and was as nearly calm as it was in his nature\r\nto be. 'Do you find Mr Smith's work satisfactory, Mr Rossiter?'\r\n\r\nPsmith waited resignedly for an outburst of complaint respecting the\r\nsmall matter that had been under discussion between the head of the\r\ndepartment and himself; but to his surprise it did not come.\r\n\r\n'Oh--ah--quite, quite, Mr Bickersdyke. I think he will very soon pick\r\nthings up.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke turned away. He was a conscientious bank manager, and\r\none can only suppose that Mr Rossiter's tribute to the earnestness of\r\none of his _employes_ was gratifying to him. But for that, one would have\r\nsaid that he was disappointed.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Mr Bickersdyke,' said Psmith.\r\n\r\nThe manager stopped.\r\n\r\n'Father sent his kind regards to you,' said Psmith benevolently.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke walked off without comment.\r\n\r\n'An uncommonly cheery, companionable feller,' murmured Psmith, as he\r\nturned to his work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first day anywhere, if one spends it in a sedentary fashion, always\r\nseemed unending; and Mike felt as if he had been sitting at his desk\r\nfor weeks when the hour for departure came. A bank's day ends\r\ngradually, reluctantly, as it were. At about five there is a sort of\r\nstir, not unlike the stir in a theatre when the curtain is on the point\r\nof falling. Ledgers are closed with a bang. Men stand about and talk\r\nfor a moment or two before going to the basement for their hats and\r\ncoats. Then, at irregular intervals, forms pass down the central aisle\r\nand out through the swing doors. There is an air of relaxation over the\r\nplace, though some departments are still working as hard as ever under\r\na blaze of electric light. Somebody begins to sing, and an instant\r\nchorus of protests and maledictions rises from all sides. Gradually,\r\nhowever, the electric lights go out. The procession down the centre\r\naisle becomes more regular; and eventually the place is left to\r\ndarkness and the night watchman.\r\n\r\nThe postage department was one of the last to be freed from duty. This\r\nwas due to the inconsiderateness of the other departments, which\r\nomitted to disgorge their letters till the last moment. Mike as he grew\r\nfamiliar with the work, and began to understand it, used to prowl round\r\nthe other departments during the afternoon and wrest letters from them,\r\nusually receiving with them much abuse for being a nuisance and not\r\nleaving honest workers alone. Today, however, he had to sit on till\r\nnearly six, waiting for the final batch of correspondence.\r\n\r\nPsmith, who had waited patiently with him, though his own work was\r\nfinished, accompanied him down to the post office and back again to the\r\nbank to return the letter basket; and they left the office together.\r\n\r\n'By the way,' said Psmith, 'what with the strenuous labours of the bank\r\nand the disturbing interviews with the powers that be, I have omitted\r\nto ask you where you are digging. Wherever it is, of course you must\r\nclear out. It is imperative, in this crisis, that we should be\r\ntogether. I have acquired a quite snug little flat in Clement's Inn.\r\nThere is a spare bedroom. It shall be yours.'\r\n\r\n'My dear chap,' said Mike, 'it's all rot. I can't sponge on you.'\r\n\r\n'You pain me, Comrade Jackson. I was not suggesting such a thing. We\r\nare business men, hard-headed young bankers. I make you a business\r\nproposition. I offer you the post of confidential secretary and adviser\r\nto me in exchange for a comfortable home. The duties will be light. You\r\nwill be required to refuse invitations to dinner from crowned heads,\r\nand to listen attentively to my views on Life. Apart from this, there\r\nis little to do. So that's settled.'\r\n\r\n'It isn't,' said Mike. 'I--'\r\n\r\n'You will enter upon your duties tonight. Where are you suspended at\r\npresent?'\r\n\r\n'Dulwich. But, look here--'\r\n\r\n'A little more, and you'll get the sack. I tell you the thing is\r\nsettled. Now, let us hail yon taximeter cab, and desire the stern-faced\r\naristocrat on the box to drive us to Dulwich. We will then collect a\r\nfew of your things in a bag, have the rest off by train, come back in\r\nthe taxi, and go and bite a chop at the Carlton. This is a momentous\r\nday in our careers, Comrade Jackson. We must buoy ourselves up.'\r\n\r\nMike made no further objections. The thought of that bed-sitting room\r\nin Acacia Road and the pantomime dame rose up and killed them. After\r\nall, Psmith was not like any ordinary person. There would be no\r\nquestion of charity. Psmith had invited him to the flat in exactly the\r\nsame spirit as he had invited him to his house for the cricket week.\r\n\r\n'You know,' said Psmith, after a silence, as they flitted through the\r\nstreets in the taximeter, 'one lives and learns. Were you so wrapped up\r\nin your work this afternoon that you did not hear my very entertaining\r\nlittle chat with Comrade Bickersdyke, or did it happen to come under\r\nyour notice? It did? Then I wonder if you were struck by the singular\r\nconduct of Comrade Rossiter?'\r\n\r\n'I thought it rather decent of him not to give you away to that\r\nblighter Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\n'Admirably put. It was precisely that that struck me. He had his\r\nopening, all ready made for him, but he refrained from depositing me in\r\nthe soup. I tell you, Comrade Jackson, my rugged old heart was touched.\r\nI said to myself, \"There must be good in Comrade Rossiter, after all. I\r\nmust cultivate him.\" I shall make it my business to be kind to our\r\nDepartmental head. He deserves the utmost consideration. His action\r\nshone like a good deed in a wicked world. Which it was, of course. From\r\ntoday onwards I take Comrade Rossiter under my wing. We seem to be\r\ngetting into a tolerably benighted quarter. Are we anywhere near?\r\n\"Through Darkest Dulwich in a Taximeter.\"'\r\n\r\nThe cab arrived at Dulwich station, and Mike stood up to direct the\r\ndriver. They whirred down Acacia Road. Mike stopped the cab and got\r\nout. A brief and somewhat embarrassing interview with the pantomime\r\ndame, during which Mike was separated from a week's rent in lieu of\r\nnotice, and he was in the cab again, bound for Clement's Inn.\r\n\r\nHis feelings that night differed considerably from the frame of mind in\r\nwhich he had gone to bed the night before. It was partly a very\r\nexcellent dinner and partly the fact that Psmith's flat, though at\r\npresent in some disorder, was obviously going to be extremely\r\ncomfortable, that worked the change. But principally it was due to his\r\nhaving found an ally. The gnawing loneliness had gone. He did not look\r\nforward to a career of Commerce with any greater pleasure than before;\r\nbut there was no doubt that with Psmith, it would be easier to get\r\nthrough the time after office hours. If all went well in the bank he\r\nmight find that he had not drawn such a bad ticket after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. The Friendly Native\r\n\r\n\r\n'The first principle of warfare,' said Psmith at breakfast next\r\nmorning, doling out bacon and eggs with the air of a medieval monarch\r\ndistributing largesse, 'is to collect a gang, to rope in allies, to\r\nsecure the cooperation of some friendly native. You may remember that\r\nat Sedleigh it was partly the sympathetic cooperation of that record\r\nblitherer, Comrade Jellicoe, which enabled us to nip the pro-Spiller\r\nmovement in the bud. It is the same in the present crisis. What Comrade\r\nJellicoe was to us at Sedleigh, Comrade Rossiter must be in the City.\r\nWe must make an ally of that man. Once I know that he and I are as\r\nbrothers, and that he will look with a lenient and benevolent eye on\r\nany little shortcomings in my work, I shall be able to devote my\r\nattention whole-heartedly to the moral reformation of Comrade\r\nBickersdyke, that man of blood. I look on Comrade Bickersdyke as a\r\nbargee of the most pronounced type; and anything I can do towards\r\nmaking him a decent member of Society shall be done freely and\r\nungrudgingly. A trifle more tea, Comrade Jackson?'\r\n\r\n'No, thanks,' said Mike. 'I've done. By Jove, Smith, this flat of yours\r\nis all right.'\r\n\r\n'Not bad,' assented Psmith, 'not bad. Free from squalor to a great\r\nextent. I have a number of little objects of _vertu_ coming down\r\nshortly from the old homestead. Pictures, and so on. It will be by no\r\nmeans un-snug when they are up. Meanwhile, I can rough it. We are old\r\ncampaigners, we Psmiths. Give us a roof, a few comfortable chairs, a\r\nsofa or two, half a dozen cushions, and decent meals, and we do not\r\nrepine. Reverting once more to Comrade Rossiter--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, what about him?' said Mike. 'You'll have a pretty tough job\r\nturning him into a friendly native, I should think. How do you mean to\r\nstart?'\r\n\r\nPsmith regarded him with a benevolent eye.\r\n\r\n'There is but one way,' he said. 'Do you remember the case of Comrade\r\nOutwood, at Sedleigh? How did we corral him, and become to him\r\npractically as long-lost sons?'\r\n\r\n'We got round him by joining the Archaeological Society.'\r\n\r\n'Precisely,' said Psmith. 'Every man has his hobby. The thing is to\r\nfind it out. In the case of comrade Rossiter, I should say that it\r\nwould be either postage stamps, dried seaweed, or Hall Caine. I shall\r\nendeavour to find out today. A few casual questions, and the thing is\r\ndone. Shall we be putting in an appearance at the busy hive now? If we\r\nare to continue in the running for the bonus stakes, it would be well\r\nto start soon.'\r\n\r\nMike's first duty at the bank that morning was to check the stamps and\r\npetty cash. While he was engaged on this task, he heard Psmith\r\nconversing affably with Mr Rossiter.\r\n\r\n'Good morning,' said Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Morning,' replied his chief, doing sleight-of-hand tricks with a\r\nbundle of letters which lay on his desk. 'Get on with your work,\r\nPsmith. We have a lot before us.'\r\n\r\n'Undoubtedly. I am all impatience. I should say that in an institution\r\nlike this, dealing as it does with distant portions of the globe, a\r\nphilatelist would have excellent opportunities of increasing his\r\ncollection. With me, stamp-collecting has always been a positive craze.\r\nI--'\r\n\r\n'I have no time for nonsense of that sort myself,' said Mr Rossiter. 'I\r\nshould advise you, if you mean to get on, to devote more time to your\r\nwork and less to stamps.'\r\n\r\n'I will start at once. Dried seaweed, again--'\r\n\r\n'Get on with your work, Smith.'\r\n\r\nPsmith retired to his desk.\r\n\r\n'This,' he said to Mike, 'is undoubtedly something in the nature of a\r\nset-back. I have drawn blank. The papers bring out posters, \"Psmith\r\nBaffled.\" I must try again. Meanwhile, to work. Work, the hobby of the\r\nphilosopher and the poor man's friend.'\r\n\r\nThe morning dragged slowly on without incident. At twelve o'clock Mike\r\nhad to go out and buy stamps, which he subsequently punched in the\r\npunching-machine in the basement, a not very exhilarating job in which\r\nhe was assisted by one of the bank messengers, who discoursed learnedly\r\non roses during the _seance_. Roses were his hobby. Mike began to\r\nsee that Psmith had reason in his assumption that the way to every\r\nman's heart was through his hobby. Mike made a firm friend of William,\r\nthe messenger, by displaying an interest and a certain knowledge of\r\nroses. At the same time the conversation had the bad effect of leading\r\nto an acute relapse in the matter of homesickness. The rose-garden at\r\nhome had been one of Mike's favourite haunts on a summer afternoon. The\r\ncontrast between it and the basement of the new Asiatic Bank, the\r\natmosphere of which was far from being roselike, was too much for his\r\nfeelings. He emerged from the depths, with his punched stamps, filled\r\nwith bitterness against Fate.\r\n\r\nHe found Psmith still baffled.\r\n\r\n'Hall Caine,' said Psmith regretfully, 'has also proved a frost. I\r\nwandered round to Comrade Rossiter's desk just now with a rather brainy\r\nexcursus on \"The Eternal City\", and was received with the Impatient\r\nFrown rather than the Glad Eye. He was in the middle of adding up a\r\nrather tricky column of figures, and my remarks caused him to drop a\r\nstitch. So far from winning the man over, I have gone back. There now\r\nexists between Comrade Rossiter and myself a certain coldness. Further\r\ninvestigations will be postponed till after lunch.'\r\n\r\nThe postage department received visitors during the morning. Members of\r\nother departments came with letters, among them Bannister. Mr Rossiter\r\nwas away in the manager's room at the time.\r\n\r\n'How are you getting on?' said Bannister to Mike.\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'Had any trouble with Rossiter yet?'\r\n\r\n'No, not much.'\r\n\r\n'He hasn't run you in to Bickersdyke?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Pardon my interrupting a conversation between old college chums,' said\r\nPsmith courteously, 'but I happened to overhear, as I toiled at my\r\ndesk, the name of Comrade Rossiter.'\r\n\r\nBannister looked somewhat startled. Mike introduced them.\r\n\r\n'This is Smith,' he said. 'Chap I was at school with. This is\r\nBannister, Smith, who used to be on here till I came.'\r\n\r\n'In this department?' asked Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Then, Comrade Bannister, you are the very man I have been looking for.\r\nYour knowledge will be invaluable to us. I have no doubt that, during\r\nyour stay in this excellently managed department, you had many\r\nopportunities of observing Comrade Rossiter?'\r\n\r\n'I should jolly well think I had,' said Bannister with a laugh. 'He saw\r\nto that. He was always popping out and cursing me about something.'\r\n\r\n'Comrade Rossiter's manners are a little restive,' agreed Psmith. 'What\r\nused you to talk to him about?'\r\n\r\n'What used I to talk to him about?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. In those interviews to which you have alluded, how did you\r\namuse, entertain Comrade Rossiter?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't. He used to do all the talking there was.'\r\n\r\nPsmith straightened his tie, and clicked his tongue, disappointed.\r\n\r\n'This is unfortunate,' he said, smoothing his hair. 'You see, Comrade\r\nBannister, it is this way. In the course of my professional duties, I\r\nfind myself continually coming into contact with Comrade Rossiter.'\r\n\r\n'I bet you do,' said Bannister.\r\n\r\n'On these occasions I am frequently at a loss for entertaining\r\nconversation. He has no difficulty, as apparently happened in your\r\ncase, in keeping up his end of the dialogue. The subject of my\r\nshortcomings provides him with ample material for speech. I, on the\r\nother hand, am dumb. I have nothing to say.'\r\n\r\n'I should think that was a bit of a change for you, wasn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps, so,' said Psmith, 'perhaps so. On the other hand, however\r\nrestful it may be to myself, it does not enable me to secure Comrade\r\nRossiter's interest and win his esteem.'\r\n\r\n'What Smith wants to know,' said Mike, 'is whether Rossiter has any\r\nhobby of any kind. He thinks, if he has, he might work it to keep in\r\nwith him.'\r\n\r\nPsmith, who had been listening with an air of pleased interest, much as\r\na father would listen to his child prattling for the benefit of a\r\nvisitor, confirmed this statement.\r\n\r\n'Comrade Jackson,' he said, 'has put the matter with his usual\r\nadmirable clearness. That is the thing in a nutshell. Has Comrade\r\nRossiter any hobby that you know of? Spillikins, brass-rubbing, the\r\nNear Eastern Question, or anything like that? I have tried him with\r\npostage-stamps (which you'd think, as head of a postage department, he\r\nought to be interested in), and dried seaweed, Hall Caine, but I have\r\nthe honour to report total failure. The man seems to have no pleasures.\r\nWhat does he do with himself when the day's toil is ended? That giant\r\nbrain must occupy itself somehow.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know,' said Bannister, 'unless it's football. I saw him once\r\nwatching Chelsea. I was rather surprised.'\r\n\r\n'Football,' said Psmith thoughtfully, 'football. By no means a scaly\r\nidea. I rather fancy, Comrade Bannister, that you have whanged the nail\r\non the head. Is he strong on any particular team? I mean, have you ever\r\nheard him, in the intervals of business worries, stamping on his desk\r\nand yelling, \"Buck up Cottagers!\" or \"Lay 'em out, Pensioners!\" or\r\nanything like that? One moment.' Psmith held up his hand. 'I will get\r\nmy Sherlock Holmes system to work. What was the other team in the\r\nmodern gladiatorial contest at which you saw Comrade Rossiter?'\r\n\r\n'Manchester United.'\r\n\r\n'And Comrade Rossiter, I should say, was a Manchester man.'\r\n\r\n'I believe he is.'\r\n\r\n'Then I am prepared to bet a small sum that he is nuts on Manchester\r\nUnited. My dear Holmes, how--! Elementary, my dear fellow, quite\r\nelementary. But here comes the lad in person.'\r\n\r\nMr Rossiter turned in from the central aisle through the counter-door,\r\nand, observing the conversational group at the postage-desk, came\r\nbounding up. Bannister moved off.\r\n\r\n'Really, Smith,' said Mr Rossiter, 'you always seem to be talking. I\r\nhave overlooked the matter once, as I did not wish to get you into\r\ntrouble so soon after joining; but, really, it cannot go on. I must\r\ntake notice of it.'\r\n\r\nPsmith held up his hand.\r\n\r\n'The fault was mine,' he said, with manly frankness. 'Entirely mine.\r\nBannister came in a purely professional spirit to deposit a letter with\r\nComrade Jackson. I engaged him in conversation on the subject of the\r\nFootball League, and I was just trying to correct his view that\r\nNewcastle United were the best team playing, when you arrived.'\r\n\r\n'It is perfectly absurd,' said Mr Rossiter, 'that you should waste the\r\nbank's time in this way. The bank pays you to work, not to talk about\r\nprofessional football.'\r\n\r\n'Just so, just so,' murmured Psmith.\r\n\r\n'There is too much talking in this department.'\r\n\r\n'I fear you are right.'\r\n\r\n'It is nonsense.'\r\n\r\n'My own view,' said Psmith, 'was that Manchester United were by far the\r\nfinest team before the public.'\r\n\r\n'Get on with your work, Smith.'\r\n\r\nMr Rossiter stumped off to his desk, where he sat as one in thought.\r\n\r\n'Smith,' he said at the end of five minutes.\r\n\r\nPsmith slid from his stool, and made his way deferentially towards him.\r\n\r\n'Bannister's a fool,' snapped Mr Rossiter.\r\n\r\n'So I thought,' said Psmith.\r\n\r\n'A perfect fool. He always was.'\r\n\r\nPsmith shook his head sorrowfully, as who should say, 'Exit Bannister.'\r\n\r\n'There is no team playing today to touch Manchester United.'\r\n\r\n'Precisely what I said to Comrade Bannister.'\r\n\r\n'Of course. You know something about it.'\r\n\r\n'The study of League football,' said Psmith, 'has been my relaxation\r\nfor years.'\r\n\r\n'But we have no time to discuss it now.'\r\n\r\n'Assuredly not, sir. Work before everything.'\r\n\r\n'Some other time, when--'\r\n\r\n'--We are less busy. Precisely.'\r\n\r\nPsmith moved back to his seat.\r\n\r\n'I fear,' he said to Mike, as he resumed work, 'that as far as Comrade\r\nRossiter's friendship and esteem are concerned, I have to a certain\r\nextent landed Comrade Bannister in the bouillon; but it was in a good\r\ncause. I fancy we have won through. Half an hour's thoughtful perusal\r\nof the \"Footballers' Who's Who\", just to find out some elementary facts\r\nabout Manchester United, and I rather think the friendly Native is\r\ncorralled. And now once more to work. Work, the hobby of the hustler\r\nand the deadbeat's dread.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. The Haunting of Mr Bickersdyke\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything in the nature of a rash and hasty move was wholly foreign to\r\nPsmith's tactics. He had the patience which is the chief quality of the\r\nsuccessful general. He was content to secure his base before making any\r\noffensive movement. It was a fortnight before he turned his attention\r\nto the education of Mr Bickersdyke. During that fortnight he conversed\r\nattractively, in the intervals of work, on the subject of League\r\nfootball in general and Manchester United in particular. The subject is\r\nnot hard to master if one sets oneself earnestly to it; and Psmith\r\nspared no pains. The football editions of the evening papers are not\r\nreticent about those who play the game: and Psmith drank in every\r\ndetail with the thoroughness of the conscientious student. By the end\r\nof the fortnight he knew what was the favourite breakfast-food of J.\r\nTurnbull; what Sandy Turnbull wore next his skin; and who, in the\r\nopinion of Meredith, was England's leading politician. These facts,\r\nimparted to and discussed with Mr Rossiter, made the progress of the\r\n_entente cordiale_ rapid. It was on the eighth day that Mr\r\nRossiter consented to lunch with the Old Etonian. On the tenth he\r\nplayed the host. By the end of the fortnight the flapping of the white\r\nwings of Peace over the Postage Department was setting up a positive\r\ndraught. Mike, who had been introduced by Psmith as a distant relative\r\nof Moger, the goalkeeper, was included in the great peace.\r\n\r\n'So that now,' said Psmith, reflectively polishing his eye-glass, 'I\r\nthink that we may consider ourselves free to attend to Comrade\r\nBickersdyke. Our bright little Mancunian friend would no more run us in\r\nnow than if we were the brothers Turnbull. We are as inside forwards to\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\nThe club to which Psmith and Mr Bickersdyke belonged was celebrated for\r\nthe steadfastness of its political views, the excellence of its\r\ncuisine, and the curiously Gorgonzolaesque marble of its main\r\nstaircase. It takes all sorts to make a world. It took about four\r\nthousand of all sorts to make the Senior Conservative Club. To be\r\nabsolutely accurate, there were three thousand seven hundred and\r\neighteen members.\r\n\r\nTo Mr Bickersdyke for the next week it seemed as if there was only one.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing crude or overdone about Psmith's methods. The\r\nordinary man, having conceived the idea of haunting a fellow clubman,\r\nmight have seized the first opportunity of engaging him in\r\nconversation. Not so Psmith. The first time he met Mr Bickersdyke in\r\nthe club was on the stairs after dinner one night. The great man,\r\nhaving received practical proof of the excellence of cuisine referred\r\nto above, was coming down the main staircase at peace with all men,\r\nwhen he was aware of a tall young man in the 'faultless evening dress'\r\nof which the female novelist is so fond, who was regarding him with a\r\nfixed stare through an eye-glass. The tall young man, having caught his\r\neye, smiled faintly, nodded in a friendly but patronizing manner, and\r\npassed on up the staircase to the library. Mr Bickersdyke sped on in\r\nsearch of a waiter.\r\n\r\nAs Psmith sat in the library with a novel, the waiter entered, and\r\napproached him.\r\n\r\n'Beg pardon, sir,' he said. 'Are you a member of this club?'\r\n\r\nPsmith fumbled in his pocket and produced his eye-glass, through which\r\nhe examined the waiter, button by button.\r\n\r\n'I am Psmith,' he said simply.\r\n\r\n'A member, sir?'\r\n\r\n'_The_ member,' said Psmith. 'Surely you participated in the\r\ngeneral rejoicings which ensued when it was announced that I had been\r\nelected? But perhaps you were too busy working to pay any attention. If\r\nso, I respect you. I also am a worker. A toiler, not a flatfish. A\r\nsizzler, not a squab. Yes, I am a member. Will you tell Mr Bickersdyke\r\nthat I am sorry, but I have been elected, and have paid my entrance fee\r\nand subscription.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe waiter went downstairs and found Mr Bickersdyke in the lower\r\nsmoking-room.\r\n\r\n'The gentleman says he is, sir.'\r\n\r\n'H'm,' said the bank-manager. 'Coffee and Benedictine, and a cigar.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nOn the following day Mr Bickersdyke met Psmith in the club three times,\r\nand on the day after that seven. Each time the latter's smile was\r\nfriendly, but patronizing. Mr Bickersdyke began to grow restless.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day Psmith made his first remark. The manager was reading\r\nthe evening paper in a corner, when Psmith sinking gracefully into a\r\nchair beside him, caused him to look up.\r\n\r\n'The rain keeps off,' said Psmith.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke looked as if he wished his employee would imitate the\r\nrain, but he made no reply.\r\n\r\nPsmith called a waiter.\r\n\r\n'Would you mind bringing me a small cup of coffee?' he said. 'And for\r\nyou,' he added to Mr Bickersdyke.\r\n\r\n'Nothing,' growled the manager.\r\n\r\n'And nothing for Mr Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\nThe waiter retired. Mr Bickersdyke became absorbed in his paper.\r\n\r\n'I see from my morning paper,' said Psmith, affably, 'that you are to\r\naddress a meeting at the Kenningford Town Hall next week. I shall come\r\nand hear you. Our politics differ in some respects, I fear--I incline\r\nto the Socialist view--but nevertheless I shall listen to your remarks\r\nwith great interest, great interest.'\r\n\r\nThe paper rustled, but no reply came from behind it.\r\n\r\n'I heard from father this morning,' resumed Psmith.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke lowered his paper and glared at him.\r\n\r\n'I don't wish to hear about your father,' he snapped.\r\n\r\nAn expression of surprise and pain came over Psmith's face.\r\n\r\n'What!' he cried. 'You don't mean to say that there is any coolness\r\nbetween my father and you? I am more grieved than I can say. Knowing,\r\nas I do, what a genuine respect my father has for your great talents, I\r\ncan only think that there must have been some misunderstanding. Perhaps\r\nif you would allow me to act as a mediator--'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke put down his paper and walked out of the room.\r\n\r\nPsmith found him a quarter of an hour later in the card-room. He sat\r\ndown beside his table, and began to observe the play with silent\r\ninterest. Mr Bickersdyke, never a great performer at the best of times,\r\nwas so unsettled by the scrutiny that in the deciding game of the\r\nrubber he revoked, thereby presenting his opponents with the rubber by\r\na very handsome majority of points. Psmith clicked his tongue\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\nDignified reticence is not a leading characteristic of the\r\nbridge-player's manner at the Senior Conservative Club on occasions\r\nlike this. Mr Bickersdyke's partner did not bear his calamity with\r\nmanly resignation. He gave tongue on the instant. 'What on earth's',\r\nand 'Why on earth's' flowed from his mouth like molten lava. Mr\r\nBickersdyke sat and fermented in silence. Psmith clicked his tongue\r\nsympathetically throughout.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke lost that control over himself which every member of a\r\nclub should possess. He turned on Psmith with a snort of frenzy.\r\n\r\n'How can I keep my attention fixed on the game when you sit staring at\r\nme like a--like a--'\r\n\r\n'I am sorry,' said Psmith gravely, 'if my stare falls short in any way\r\nof your ideal of what a stare should be; but I appeal to these\r\ngentlemen. Could I have watched the game more quietly?'\r\n\r\n'Of course not,' said the bereaved partner warmly. 'Nobody could have\r\nany earthly objection to your behaviour. It was absolute carelessness.\r\nI should have thought that one might have expected one's partner at a\r\nclub like this to exercise elementary--'\r\n\r\nBut Mr Bickersdyke had gone. He had melted silently away like the\r\ndriven snow.\r\n\r\nPsmith took his place at the table.\r\n\r\n'A somewhat nervous excitable man, Mr Bickersdyke, I should say,' he\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n'A somewhat dashed, blanked idiot,' emended the bank-manager's late\r\npartner. 'Thank goodness he lost as much as I did. That's some light\r\nconsolation.'\r\n\r\nPsmith arrived at the flat to find Mike still out. Mike had repaired to\r\nthe Gaiety earlier in the evening to refresh his mind after the labours\r\nof the day. When he returned, Psmith was sitting in an armchair with\r\nhis feet on the mantelpiece, musing placidly on Life.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'Well? And how was the Gaiety? Good show?'\r\n\r\n'Jolly good. What about Bickersdyke?'\r\n\r\nPsmith looked sad.\r\n\r\n'I cannot make Comrade Bickersdyke out,' he said. 'You would think that\r\na man would be glad to see the son of a personal friend. On the\r\ncontrary, I may be wronging Comrade B., but I should almost be inclined\r\nto say that my presence in the Senior Conservative Club tonight\r\nirritated him. There was no _bonhomie_ in his manner. He seemed to\r\nme to be giving a spirited imitation of a man about to foam at the\r\nmouth. I did my best to entertain him. I chatted. His only reply was to\r\nleave the room. I followed him to the card-room, and watched his very\r\nremarkable and brainy tactics at bridge, and he accused me of causing\r\nhim to revoke. A very curious personality, that of Comrade Bickersdyke.\r\nBut let us dismiss him from our minds. Rumours have reached me,' said\r\nPsmith, 'that a very decent little supper may be obtained at a quaint,\r\nold-world eating-house called the Savoy. Will you accompany me thither\r\non a tissue-restoring expedition? It would be rash not to probe these\r\nrumours to their foundation, and ascertain their exact truth.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Mr Bickersdyke Addresses His Constituents\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was noted by the observant at the bank next morning that Mr\r\nBickersdyke had something on his mind. William, the messenger, knew it,\r\nwhen he found his respectful salute ignored. Little Briggs, the\r\naccountant, knew it when his obsequious but cheerful 'Good morning' was\r\nacknowledged only by a 'Morn'' which was almost an oath. Mr Bickersdyke\r\npassed up the aisle and into his room like an east wind. He sat down at\r\nhis table and pressed the bell. Harold, William's brother and\r\nco-messenger, entered with the air of one ready to duck if any missile\r\nshould be thrown at him. The reports of the manager's frame of mind had\r\nbeen circulated in the office, and Harold felt somewhat apprehensive.\r\nIt was on an occasion very similar to this that George Barstead,\r\nformerly in the employ of the New Asiatic Bank in the capacity of\r\nmessenger, had been rash enough to laugh at what he had taken for a\r\njoke of Mr Bickersdyke's, and had been instantly presented with the\r\nsack for gross impertinence.\r\n\r\n'Ask Mr Smith--' began the manager. Then he paused. 'No, never mind,'\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\nHarold remained in the doorway, puzzled.\r\n\r\n'Don't stand there gaping at me, man,' cried Mr Bickersdyke, 'Go away.'\r\n\r\nHarold retired and informed his brother, William, that in his,\r\nHarold's, opinion, Mr Bickersdyke was off his chump.\r\n\r\n'Off his onion,' said William, soaring a trifle higher in poetic\r\nimagery.\r\n\r\n'Barmy,' was the terse verdict of Samuel Jakes, the third messenger.\r\n'Always said so.' And with that the New Asiatic Bank staff of\r\nmessengers dismissed Mr Bickersdyke and proceeded to concentrate\r\nthemselves on their duties, which consisted principally of hanging\r\nabout and discussing the prophecies of that modern seer, Captain Coe.\r\n\r\nWhat had made Mr Bickersdyke change his mind so abruptly was the sudden\r\nrealization of the fact that he had no case against Psmith. In his\r\ncapacity of manager of the bank he could not take official notice of\r\nPsmith's behaviour outside office hours, especially as Psmith had done\r\nnothing but stare at him. It would be impossible to make anybody\r\nunderstand the true inwardness of Psmith's stare. Theoretically, Mr\r\nBickersdyke had the power to dismiss any subordinate of his whom he did\r\nnot consider satisfactory, but it was a power that had to be exercised\r\nwith discretion. The manager was accountable for his actions to the\r\nBoard of Directors. If he dismissed Psmith, Psmith would certainly\r\nbring an action against the bank for wrongful dismissal, and on the\r\nevidence he would infallibly win it. Mr Bickersdyke did not welcome the\r\nprospect of having to explain to the Directors that he had let the\r\nshareholders of the bank in for a fine of whatever a discriminating\r\njury cared to decide upon, simply because he had been stared at while\r\nplaying bridge. His only hope was to catch Psmith doing his work badly.\r\n\r\nHe touched the bell again, and sent for Mr Rossiter.\r\n\r\nThe messenger found the head of the Postage Department in conversation\r\nwith Psmith. Manchester United had been beaten by one goal to nil on\r\nthe previous afternoon, and Psmith was informing Mr Rossiter that the\r\nreferee was a robber, who had evidently been financially interested in\r\nthe result of the game. The way he himself looked at it, said Psmith,\r\nwas that the thing had been a moral victory for the United. Mr Rossiter\r\nsaid yes, he thought so too. And it was at this moment that Mr\r\nBickersdyke sent for him to ask whether Psmith's work was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Postage Department gave his opinion without hesitation.\r\nPsmith's work was about the hottest proposition he had ever struck.\r\nPsmith's work--well, it stood alone. You couldn't compare it with\r\nanything. There are no degrees in perfection. Psmith's work was\r\nperfect, and there was an end to it.\r\n\r\nHe put it differently, but that was the gist of what he said.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke observed he was glad to hear it, and smashed a nib by\r\nstabbing the desk with it.\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening following this that the bank-manager was due to\r\naddress a meeting at the Kenningford Town Hall.\r\n\r\nHe was looking forward to the event with mixed feelings. He had stood\r\nfor Parliament once before, several years back, in the North. He had\r\nbeen defeated by a couple of thousand votes, and he hoped that the\r\nepisode had been forgotten. Not merely because his defeat had been\r\nheavy. There was another reason. On that occasion he had stood as a\r\nLiberal. He was standing for Kenningford as a Unionist. Of course, a\r\nman is at perfect liberty to change his views, if he wishes to do so,\r\nbut the process is apt to give his opponents a chance of catching him\r\n(to use the inspired language of the music-halls) on the bend. Mr\r\nBickersdyke was rather afraid that the light-hearted electors of\r\nKenningford might avail themselves of this chance.\r\n\r\nKenningford, S.E., is undoubtedly by way of being a tough sort of\r\nplace. Its inhabitants incline to a robust type of humour, which finds\r\na verbal vent in catch phrases and expends itself physically in\r\nsmashing shop-windows and kicking policemen. He feared that the meeting\r\nat the Town Hall might possibly be a trifle rowdy.\r\n\r\nAll political meetings are very much alike. Somebody gets up and\r\nintroduces the speaker of the evening, and then the speaker of the\r\nevening says at great length what he thinks of the scandalous manner in\r\nwhich the Government is behaving or the iniquitous goings-on of the\r\nOpposition. From time to time confederates in the audience rise and ask\r\ncarefully rehearsed questions, and are answered fully and\r\nsatisfactorily by the orator. When a genuine heckler interrupts, the\r\norator either ignores him, or says haughtily that he can find him\r\narguments but cannot find him brains. Or, occasionally, when the\r\nquestion is an easy one, he answers it. A quietly conducted political\r\nmeeting is one of England's most delightful indoor games. When the\r\nmeeting is rowdy, the audience has more fun, but the speaker a good\r\ndeal less.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke's introducer was an elderly Scotch peer, an excellent\r\nman for the purpose in every respect, except that he possessed a very\r\nstrong accent.\r\n\r\nThe audience welcomed that accent uproariously. The electors of\r\nKenningford who really had any definite opinions on politics were\r\nfairly equally divided. There were about as many earnest Liberals as\r\nthere were earnest Unionists. But besides these there was a strong\r\ncontingent who did not care which side won. These looked on elections\r\nas Heaven-sent opportunities for making a great deal of noise. They\r\nattended meetings in order to extract amusement from them; and they\r\nvoted, if they voted at all, quite irresponsibly. A funny story at the\r\nexpense of one candidate told on the morning of the polling, was quite\r\nlikely to send these brave fellows off in dozens filling in their\r\npapers for the victim's opponent.\r\n\r\nThere was a solid block of these gay spirits at the back of the hall.\r\nThey received the Scotch peer with huge delight. He reminded them of\r\nHarry Lauder and they said so. They addressed him affectionately as\r\n'Arry', throughout his speech, which was rather long. They implored him\r\nto be a pal and sing 'The Saftest of the Family'. Or, failing that, 'I\r\nlove a lassie'. Finding they could not induce him to do this, they did\r\nit themselves. They sang it several times. When the peer, having\r\nfinished his remarks on the subject of Mr Bickersdyke, at length sat\r\ndown, they cheered for seven minutes, and demanded an encore.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was in excellent spirits when Mr Bickersdyke rose to\r\naddress it.\r\n\r\nThe effort of doing justice to the last speaker had left the free and\r\nindependent electors at the back of the hall slightly limp. The\r\nbank-manager's opening remarks were received without any demonstration.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke spoke well. He had a penetrating, if harsh, voice, and\r\nhe said what he had to say forcibly. Little by little the audience came\r\nunder his spell. When, at the end of a well-turned sentence, he paused\r\nand took a sip of water, there was a round of applause, in which many\r\nof the admirers of Mr Harry Lauder joined.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his speech. The audience listened intently. Mr Bickersdyke,\r\nhaving said some nasty things about Free Trade and the Alien Immigrant,\r\nturned to the Needs of the Navy and the necessity of increasing the\r\nfleet at all costs.\r\n\r\n'This is no time for half-measures,' he said. 'We must do our utmost.\r\nWe must burn our boats--'\r\n\r\n'Excuse me,' said a gentle voice.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke broke off. In the centre of the hall a tall figure had\r\nrisen. Mr Bickersdyke found himself looking at a gleaming eye-glass\r\nwhich the speaker had just polished and inserted in his eye.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary heckler Mr Bickersdyke would have taken in his stride. He\r\nhad got his audience, and simply by continuing and ignoring the\r\ninterruption, he could have won through in safety. But the sudden\r\nappearance of Psmith unnerved him. He remained silent.\r\n\r\n'How,' asked Psmith, 'do you propose to strengthen the Navy by burning\r\nboats?'\r\n\r\nThe inanity of the question enraged even the pleasure-seekers at the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n'Order! Order!' cried the earnest contingent.\r\n\r\n'Sit down, fice!' roared the pleasure-seekers.\r\n\r\nPsmith sat down with a patient smile.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke resumed his speech. But the fire had gone out of it. He\r\nhad lost his audience. A moment before, he had grasped them and played\r\non their minds (or what passed for minds down Kenningford way) as on a\r\nstringed instrument. Now he had lost his hold.\r\n\r\nHe spoke on rapidly, but he could not get into his stride. The trivial\r\ninterruption had broken the spell. His words lacked grip. The dead\r\nsilence in which the first part of his speech had been received, that\r\nsilence which is a greater tribute to the speaker than any applause,\r\nhad given place to a restless medley of little noises; here a cough;\r\nthere a scraping of a boot along the floor, as its wearer moved\r\nuneasily in his seat; in another place a whispered conversation. The\r\naudience was bored.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke left the Navy, and went on to more general topics. But\r\nhe was not interesting. He quoted figures, saw a moment later that he\r\nhad not quoted them accurately, and instead of carrying on boldly, went\r\nback and corrected himself.\r\n\r\n'Gow up top!' said a voice at the back of the hall, and there was a\r\ngeneral laugh.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke galloped unsteadily on. He condemned the Government. He\r\nsaid they had betrayed their trust.\r\n\r\nAnd then he told an anecdote.\r\n\r\n'The Government, gentlemen,' he said, 'achieves nothing worth\r\nachieving, and every individual member of the Government takes all the\r\ncredit for what is done to himself. Their methods remind me, gentlemen,\r\nof an amusing experience I had while fishing one summer in the Lake\r\nDistrict.'\r\n\r\nIn a volume entitled 'Three Men in a Boat' there is a story of how the\r\nauthor and a friend go into a riverside inn and see a very large trout\r\nin a glass case. They make inquiries about it, have men assure them,\r\none by one, that the trout was caught by themselves. In the end the\r\ntrout turns out to be made of plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke told that story as an experience of his own while\r\nfishing one summer in the Lake District.\r\n\r\nIt went well. The meeting was amused. Mr Bickersdyke went on to draw a\r\ntrenchant comparison between the lack of genuine merit in the trout and\r\nthe lack of genuine merit in the achievements of His Majesty's\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThere was applause.\r\n\r\nWhen it had ceased, Psmith rose to his feet again.\r\n\r\n'Excuse me,' he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Misunderstood\r\n\r\n\r\nMike had refused to accompany Psmith to the meeting that evening,\r\nsaying that he got too many chances in the ordinary way of business of\r\nhearing Mr Bickersdyke speak, without going out of his way to make\r\nmore. So Psmith had gone off to Kenningford alone, and Mike, feeling\r\ntoo lazy to sally out to any place of entertainment, had remained at\r\nthe flat with a novel.\r\n\r\nHe was deep in this, when there was the sound of a key in the latch,\r\nand shortly afterwards Psmith entered the room. On Psmith's brow there\r\nwas a look of pensive care, and also a slight discoloration. When he\r\nremoved his overcoat, Mike saw that his collar was burst and hanging\r\nloose and that he had no tie. On his erstwhile speckless and gleaming\r\nshirt front were number of finger-impressions, of a boldness and\r\nclearness of outline which would have made a Bertillon expert leap with\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' said Mike dropping his book.\r\n\r\nPsmith nodded in silence, went to his bedroom, and returned with a\r\nlooking-glass. Propping this up on a table, he proceeded to examine\r\nhimself with the utmost care. He shuddered slightly as his eye fell on\r\nthe finger-marks; and without a word he went into his bathroom again.\r\nHe emerged after an interval of ten minutes in sky-blue pyjamas,\r\nslippers, and an Old Etonian blazer. He lit a cigarette; and, sitting\r\ndown, stared pensively into the fire.\r\n\r\n'What the dickens have you been playing at?' demanded Mike.\r\n\r\nPsmith heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n'That,' he replied, 'I could not say precisely. At one moment it seemed\r\nto be Rugby football, at another a jiu-jitsu _seance_. Later, it\r\nbore a resemblance to a pantomime rally. However, whatever it was, it\r\nwas all very bright and interesting. A distinct experience.'\r\n\r\n'Have you been scrapping?' asked Mike. 'What happened? Was there a\r\nrow?'\r\n\r\n'There was,' said Psmith, 'in a measure what might be described as a\r\nrow. At least, when you find a perfect stranger attaching himself to\r\nyour collar and pulling, you begin to suspect that something of that\r\nkind is on the bill.'\r\n\r\n'Did they do that?'\r\n\r\nPsmith nodded.\r\n\r\n'A merchant in a moth-eaten bowler started warbling to a certain extent\r\nwith me. It was all very trying for a man of culture. He was a man who\r\nhad, I should say, discovered that alcohol was a food long before the\r\ndoctors found it out. A good chap, possibly, but a little boisterous in\r\nhis manner. Well, well.'\r\n\r\nPsmith shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n'He got you one on the forehead,' said Mike, 'or somebody did. Tell us\r\nwhat happened. I wish the dickens I'd come with you. I'd no notion\r\nthere would be a rag of any sort. What did happen?'\r\n\r\n'Comrade Jackson,' said Psmith sorrowfully, 'how sad it is in this life\r\nof ours to be consistently misunderstood. You know, of course, how\r\nwrapped up I am in Comrade Bickersdyke's welfare. You know that all my\r\nefforts are directed towards making a decent man of him; that, in\r\nshort, I am his truest friend. Does he show by so much as a word that\r\nhe appreciates my labours? Not he. I believe that man is beginning to\r\ndislike me, Comrade Jackson.'\r\n\r\n'What happened, anyhow? Never mind about Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it was mistaken zeal on my part.... Well, I will tell you all.\r\nMake a long arm for the shovel, Comrade Jackson, and pile on a few more\r\ncoals. I thank you. Well, all went quite smoothly for a while. Comrade\r\nB. in quite good form. Got his second wind, and was going strong for the\r\ntape, when a regrettable incident occurred. He informed the meeting,\r\nthat while up in the Lake country, fishing, he went to an inn and saw\r\na remarkably large stuffed trout in a glass case. He made inquiries,\r\nand found that five separate and distinct people had caught--'\r\n\r\n'Why, dash it all,' said Mike, 'that's a frightful chestnut.'\r\n\r\nPsmith nodded.\r\n\r\n'It certainly has appeared in print,' he said. 'In fact I should have\r\nsaid it was rather a well-known story. I was so interested in Comrade\r\nBickersdyke's statement that the thing had happened to himself that,\r\npurely out of good-will towards him, I got up and told him that I\r\nthought it was my duty, as a friend, to let him know that a man named\r\nJerome had pinched his story, put it in a book, and got money by it.\r\nMoney, mark you, that should by rights have been Comrade Bickersdyke's.\r\nHe didn't appear to care much about sifting the matter thoroughly. In\r\nfact, he seemed anxious to get on with his speech, and slur the matter\r\nover. But, tactlessly perhaps, I continued rather to harp on the thing.\r\nI said that the book in which the story had appeared was published in\r\n1889. I asked him how long ago it was that he had been on his fishing\r\ntour, because it was important to know in order to bring the charge\r\nhome against Jerome. Well, after a bit, I was amazed, and pained, too,\r\nto hear Comrade Bickersdyke urging certain bravoes in the audience to\r\nturn me out. If ever there was a case of biting the hand that fed\r\nhim.... Well, well.... By this time the meeting had begun to take sides\r\nto some extent. What I might call my party, the Earnest Investigators,\r\nwere whistling between their fingers, stamping on the floor, and\r\nshouting, \"Chestnuts!\" while the opposing party, the bravoes, seemed to\r\nbe trying, as I say, to do jiu-jitsu tricks with me. It was a painful\r\nsituation. I know the cultivated man of affairs should have passed the\r\nthing off with a short, careless laugh; but, owing to the\r\nabove-mentioned alcohol-expert having got both hands under my collar,\r\nshort, careless laughs were off. I was compelled, very reluctantly, to\r\nconclude the interview by tapping the bright boy on the jaw. He took\r\nthe hint, and sat down on the floor. I thought no more of the matter,\r\nand was making my way thoughtfully to the exit, when a second man of\r\nwrath put the above on my forehead. You can't ignore a thing like that.\r\nI collected some of his waistcoat and one of his legs, and hove him\r\nwith some vim into the middle distance. By this time a good many of the\r\nEarnest Investigators were beginning to join in; and it was just there\r\nthat the affair began to have certain points of resemblance to a\r\npantomime rally. Everybody seemed to be shouting a good deal and\r\nhitting everybody else. It was no place for a man of delicate culture,\r\nso I edged towards the door, and drifted out. There was a cab in the\r\noffing. I boarded it. And, having kicked a vigorous politician in the\r\nstomach, as he was endeavouring to climb in too, I drove off home.'\r\n\r\nPsmith got up, looked at his forehead once more in the glass, sighed,\r\nand sat down again.\r\n\r\n'All very disturbing,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott,' said Mike, 'I wish I'd come. Why on earth didn't you\r\ntell me you were going to rag? I think you might as well have done. I\r\nwouldn't have missed it for worlds.'\r\n\r\nPsmith regarded him with raised eyebrows.\r\n\r\n'Rag!' he said. 'Comrade Jackson, I do not understand you. You surely\r\ndo not think that I had any other object in doing what I did than to\r\nserve Comrade Bickersdyke? It's terrible how one's motives get\r\ndistorted in this world of ours.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Mike, with a grin, 'I know one person who'll jolly well\r\ndistort your motives, as you call it, and that's Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\nPsmith looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\n'True,' he said, 'true. There is that possibility. I tell you, Comrade\r\nJackson, once more that my bright young life is being slowly blighted\r\nby the frightful way in which that man misunderstands me. It seems\r\nalmost impossible to try to do him a good turn without having the\r\naction misconstrued.'\r\n\r\n'What'll you say to him tomorrow?'\r\n\r\n'I shall make no allusion to the painful affair. If I happen to meet\r\nhim in the ordinary course of business routine, I shall pass some\r\nlight, pleasant remark--on the weather, let us say, or the Bank\r\nrate--and continue my duties.'\r\n\r\n'How about if he sends for you, and wants to do the light, pleasant\r\nremark business on his own?'\r\n\r\n'In that case I shall not thwart him. If he invites me into his private\r\nroom, I shall be his guest, and shall discuss, to the best of my\r\nability, any topic which he may care to introduce. There shall be no\r\nconstraint between Comrade Bickersdyke and myself.'\r\n\r\n'No, I shouldn't think there would be. I wish I could come and hear\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'I wish you could,' said Psmith courteously.\r\n\r\n'Still, it doesn't matter much to you. You don't care if you do get\r\nsacked.'\r\n\r\nPsmith rose.\r\n\r\n'In that way possibly, as you say, I am agreeably situated. If the New\r\nAsiatic Bank does not require Psmith's services, there are other\r\nspheres where a young man of spirit may carve a place for himself. No,\r\nwhat is worrying me, Comrade Jackson, is not the thought of the push.\r\nIt is the growing fear that Comrade Bickersdyke and I will never\r\nthoroughly understand and appreciate one another. A deep gulf lies\r\nbetween us. I do what I can do to bridge it over, but he makes no\r\nresponse. On his side of the gulf building operations appear to be at\r\nan entire standstill. That is what is carving these lines of care on my\r\nforehead, Comrade Jackson. That is what is painting these purple\r\ncircles beneath my eyes. Quite inadvertently to be disturbing Comrade\r\nBickersdyke, annoying him, preventing him from enjoying life. How sad\r\nthis is. Life bulges with these tragedies.'\r\n\r\nMike picked up the evening paper.\r\n\r\n'Don't let it keep you awake at night,' he said. 'By the way, did you\r\nsee that Manchester United were playing this afternoon? They won. You'd\r\nbetter sit down and sweat up some of the details. You'll want them\r\ntomorrow.'\r\n\r\n'You are very right, Comrade Jackson,' said Psmith, reseating himself.\r\n'So the Mancunians pushed the bulb into the meshes beyond the uprights\r\nno fewer than four times, did they? Bless the dear boys, what spirits\r\nthey do enjoy, to be sure. Comrade Jackson, do not disturb me. I must\r\nconcentrate myself. These are deep waters.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. In a Nutshell\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke sat in his private room at the New Asiatic Bank with a\r\npile of newspapers before him. At least, the casual observer would have\r\nsaid that it was Mr Bickersdyke. In reality, however, it was an active\r\nvolcano in the shape and clothes of the bank-manager. It was freely\r\nadmitted in the office that morning that the manager had lowered all\r\nrecords with ease. The staff had known him to be in a bad temper\r\nbefore--frequently; but his frame of mind on all previous occasions had\r\nbeen, compared with his present frame of mind, that of a rather\r\nexceptionally good-natured lamb. Within ten minutes of his arrival the\r\nentire office was on the jump. The messengers were collected in a\r\npallid group in the basement, discussing the affair in whispers and\r\nendeavouring to restore their nerve with about sixpenn'orth of the\r\nbeverage known as 'unsweetened'. The heads of departments, to a man,\r\nhad bowed before the storm. Within the space of seven minutes and a\r\nquarter Mr Bickersdyke had contrived to find some fault with each of\r\nthem. Inward Bills was out at an A.B.C. shop snatching a hasty cup of\r\ncoffee, to pull him together again. Outward Bills was sitting at his\r\ndesk with the glazed stare of one who has been struck in the thorax by\r\na thunderbolt. Mr Rossiter had been torn from Psmith in the middle of a\r\nhighly technical discussion of the Manchester United match, just as he\r\nwas showing--with the aid of a ball of paper--how he had once seen\r\nMeredith centre to Sandy Turnbull in a Cup match, and was now leaping\r\nabout like a distracted grasshopper. Mr Waller, head of the Cash\r\nDepartment, had been summoned to the Presence, and after listening\r\nmeekly to a rush of criticism, had retired to his desk with the air of\r\na beaten spaniel.\r\n\r\nOnly one man of the many in the building seemed calm and happy--Psmith.\r\n\r\nPsmith had resumed the chat about Manchester United, on Mr Rossiter's\r\nreturn from the lion's den, at the spot where it had been broken off;\r\nbut, finding that the head of the Postage Department was in no mood for\r\ndiscussing football (or any thing else), he had postponed his remarks\r\nand placidly resumed his work.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke picked up a paper, opened it, and began searching the\r\ncolumns. He had not far to look. It was a slack season for the\r\nnewspapers, and his little trouble, which might have received a\r\nparagraph in a busy week, was set forth fully in three-quarters of a\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nThe column was headed, 'Amusing Heckling'.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke read a few lines, and crumpled the paper up with a\r\nsnort.\r\n\r\nThe next he examined was an organ of his own shade of political\r\nopinion. It too, gave him nearly a column, headed 'Disgraceful Scene at\r\nKenningford'. There was also a leaderette on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe leaderette said so exactly what Mr Bickersdyke thought himself that\r\nfor a moment he was soothed. Then the thought of his grievance\r\nreturned, and he pressed the bell.\r\n\r\n'Send Mr Smith to me,' he said.\r\n\r\nWilliam, the messenger, proceeded to inform Psmith of the summons.\r\n\r\nPsmith's face lit up.\r\n\r\n'I am always glad to sweeten the monotony of toil with a chat with\r\nLittle Clarence,' he said. 'I shall be with him in a moment.'\r\n\r\nHe cleaned his pen very carefully, placed it beside his ledger, flicked\r\na little dust off his coatsleeve, and made his way to the manager's\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke received him with the ominous restraint of a tiger\r\ncrouching for its spring. Psmith stood beside the table with languid\r\ngrace, suggestive of some favoured confidential secretary waiting for\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nA ponderous silence brooded over the room for some moments. Psmith\r\nbroke it by remarking that the Bank Rate was unchanged. He mentioned\r\nthis fact as if it afforded him a personal gratification.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke spoke.\r\n\r\n'Well, Mr Smith?' he said.\r\n\r\n'You wished to see me about something, sir?' inquired Psmith,\r\ningratiatingly.\r\n\r\n'You know perfectly well what I wished to see you about. I want to hear\r\nyour explanation of what occurred last night.'\r\n\r\n'May I sit, sir?'\r\n\r\nHe dropped gracefully into a chair, without waiting for permission,\r\nand, having hitched up the knees of his trousers, beamed winningly at\r\nthe manager.\r\n\r\n'A deplorable affair,' he said, with a shake of his head. 'Extremely\r\ndeplorable. We must not judge these rough, uneducated men too harshly,\r\nhowever. In a time of excitement the emotions of the lower classes are\r\neasily stirred. Where you or I would--'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke interrupted.\r\n\r\n'I do not wish for any more buffoonery, Mr Smith--'\r\n\r\nPsmith raised a pained pair of eyebrows.\r\n\r\n'Buffoonery, sir!'\r\n\r\n'I cannot understand what made you act as you did last night, unless\r\nyou are perfectly mad, as I am beginning to think.'\r\n\r\n'But, surely, sir, there was nothing remarkable in my behaviour? When a\r\nmerchant has attached himself to your collar, can you do less than\r\nsmite him on the other cheek? I merely acted in self-defence. You saw\r\nfor yourself--'\r\n\r\n'You know what I am alluding to. Your behaviour during my speech.'\r\n\r\n'An excellent speech,' murmured Psmith courteously.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Mr Bickersdyke.\r\n\r\n'It was, perhaps, mistaken zeal on my part, sir, but you must remember\r\nthat I acted purely from the best motives. It seemed to me--'\r\n\r\n'That is enough, Mr Smith. I confess that I am absolutely at a loss to\r\nunderstand you--'\r\n\r\n'It is too true, sir,' sighed Psmith.\r\n\r\n'You seem,' continued Mr Bickersdyke, warming to his subject, and\r\nturning gradually a richer shade of purple, 'you seem to be determined\r\nto endeavour to annoy me.' ('No no,' from Psmith.) 'I can only assume\r\nthat you are not in your right senses. You follow me about in my club--'\r\n\r\n'Our club, sir,' murmured Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Be good enough not to interrupt me, Mr Smith. You dog my footsteps in\r\nmy club--'\r\n\r\n'Purely accidental, sir. We happen to meet--that is all.'\r\n\r\n'You attend meetings at which I am speaking, and behave in a perfectly\r\nimbecile manner.'\r\n\r\nPsmith moaned slightly.\r\n\r\n'It may seem humorous to you, but I can assure you it is extremely bad\r\npolicy on your part. The New Asiatic Bank is no place for humour, and I\r\nthink--'\r\n\r\n'Excuse me, sir,' said Psmith.\r\n\r\nThe manager started at the familiar phrase. The plum-colour of his\r\ncomplexion deepened.\r\n\r\n'I entirely agree with you, sir,' said Psmith, 'that this bank is no\r\nplace for humour.'\r\n\r\n'Very well, then. You--'\r\n\r\n'And I am never humorous in it. I arrive punctually in the morning,\r\nand I work steadily and earnestly till my labours are completed. I\r\nthink you will find, on inquiry, that Mr Rossiter is satisfied with my\r\nwork.'\r\n\r\n'That is neither here nor--'\r\n\r\n'Surely, sir,' said Psmith, 'you are wrong? Surely your jurisdiction\r\nceases after office hours? Any little misunderstanding we may have at\r\nthe close of the day's work cannot affect you officially. You could\r\nnot, for instance, dismiss me from the service of the bank if we were\r\npartners at bridge at the club and I happened to revoke.'\r\n\r\n'I can dismiss you, let me tell you, Mr Smith, for studied insolence,\r\nwhether in the office or not.'\r\n\r\n'I bow to superior knowledge,' said Psmith politely, 'but I confess I\r\ndoubt it. And,' he added, 'there is another point. May I continue to\r\nsome extent?'\r\n\r\n'If you have anything to say, say it.'\r\n\r\nPsmith flung one leg over the other, and settled his collar.\r\n\r\n'It is perhaps a delicate matter,' he said, 'but it is best to be\r\nfrank. We should have no secrets. To put my point quite clearly, I must\r\ngo back a little, to the time when you paid us that very welcome\r\nweek-end visit at our house in August.'\r\n\r\n'If you hope to make capital out of the fact that I have been a guest\r\nof your father--'\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' said Psmith deprecatingly. 'Not at all. You do not take\r\nme. My point is this. I do not wish to revive painful memories, but it\r\ncannot be denied that there was, here and there, some slight bickering\r\nbetween us on that occasion. The fault,' said Psmith magnanimously,\r\n'was possibly mine. I may have been too exacting, too capricious.\r\nPerhaps so. However, the fact remains that you conceived the happy\r\nnotion of getting me into this bank, under the impression that, once I\r\nwas in, you would be able to--if I may use the expression--give me\r\nbeans. You said as much to me, if I remember. I hate to say it, but\r\ndon't you think that if you give me the sack, although my work is\r\nsatisfactory to the head of my department, you will be by way of\r\nadmitting that you bit off rather more than you could chew? I merely\r\nmake the suggestion.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke half rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n'You--'\r\n\r\n'Just so, just so, but--to return to the main point--don't you? The\r\nwhole painful affair reminds me of the story of Agesilaus and the\r\nPetulant Pterodactyl, which as you have never heard, I will now proceed\r\nto relate. Agesilaus--'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke made a curious clucking noise in his throat.\r\n\r\n'I am boring you,' said Psmith, with ready tact. 'Suffice it to say\r\nthat Comrade Agesilaus interfered with the pterodactyl, which was doing\r\nhim no harm; and the intelligent creature, whose motto was \"Nemo me\r\nimpune lacessit\", turned and bit him. Bit him good and hard, so that\r\nAgesilaus ever afterwards had a distaste for pterodactyls. His\r\nreluctance to disturb them became quite a byword. The Society papers of\r\nthe period frequently commented upon it. Let us draw the parallel.'\r\n\r\nHere Mr Bickersdyke, who had been clucking throughout this speech,\r\nessayed to speak; but Psmith hurried on.\r\n\r\n'You are Agesilaus,' he said. 'I am the Petulant Pterodactyl. You, if I\r\nmay say so, butted in of your own free will, and took me from a happy\r\nhome, simply in order that you might get me into this place under you,\r\nand give me beans. But, curiously enough, the major portion of that\r\nvegetable seems to be coming to you. Of course, you can administer the\r\npush if you like; but, as I say, it will be by way of a confession that\r\nyour scheme has sprung a leak. Personally,' said Psmith, as one friend\r\nto another, 'I should advise you to stick it out. You never know what\r\nmay happen. At any moment I may fall from my present high standard of\r\nindustry and excellence; and then you have me, so to speak, where the\r\nhair is crisp.'\r\n\r\nHe paused. Mr Bickersdyke's eyes, which even in their normal state\r\nprotruded slightly, now looked as if they might fall out at any moment.\r\nHis face had passed from the plum-coloured stage to something beyond.\r\nEvery now and then he made the clucking noise, but except for that he\r\nwas silent. Psmith, having waited for some time for something in the\r\nshape of comment or criticism on his remarks, now rose.\r\n\r\n'It has been a great treat to me, this little chat,' he said affably,\r\n'but I fear that I must no longer allow purely social enjoyments to\r\ninterfere with my commercial pursuits. With your permission, I will\r\nrejoin my department, where my absence is doubtless already causing\r\ncomment and possibly dismay. But we shall be meeting at the club\r\nshortly, I hope. Good-bye, sir, good-bye.'\r\n\r\nHe left the room, and walked dreamily back to the Postage Department,\r\nleaving the manager still staring glassily at nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Mike is Moved On\r\n\r\n\r\nThis episode may be said to have concluded the first act of the\r\ncommercial drama in which Mike and Psmith had been cast for leading\r\nparts. And, as usually happens after the end of an act, there was a\r\nlull for a while until things began to work up towards another climax.\r\nMike, as day succeeded day, began to grow accustomed to the life of the\r\nbank, and to find that it had its pleasant side after all. Whenever a\r\nnumber of people are working at the same thing, even though that thing\r\nis not perhaps what they would have chosen as an object in life, if\r\nleft to themselves, there is bound to exist an atmosphere of\r\ngood-fellowship; something akin to, though a hundred times weaker\r\nthan, the public school spirit. Such a community lacks the main motive\r\nof the public school spirit, which is pride in the school and its\r\nachievements. Nobody can be proud of the achievements of a bank. When\r\nthe business of arranging a new Japanese loan was given to the New\r\nAsiatic Bank, its employees did not stand on stools, and cheer. On the\r\ncontrary, they thought of the extra work it would involve; and they\r\ncursed a good deal, though there was no denying that it was a big thing\r\nfor the bank--not unlike winning the Ashburton would be to a school.\r\nThere is a cold impersonality about a bank. A school is a living thing.\r\n\r\nSetting aside this important difference, there was a good deal of the\r\npublic school about the New Asiatic Bank. The heads of departments were\r\nnot quite so autocratic as masters, and one was treated more on a\r\ngrown-up scale, as man to man; but, nevertheless, there remained a\r\ndistinct flavour of a school republic. Most of the men in the bank,\r\nwith the exception of certain hard-headed Scotch youths drafted in from\r\nother establishments in the City, were old public school men. Mike\r\nfound two Old Wrykinians in the first week. Neither was well known to\r\nhim. They had left in his second year in the team. But it was pleasant\r\nto have them about, and to feel that they had been educated at the\r\nright place.\r\n\r\nAs far as Mike's personal comfort went, the presence of these two\r\nWrykinians was very much for the good. Both of them knew all about his\r\ncricket, and they spread the news. The New Asiatic Bank, like most\r\nLondon banks, was keen on sport, and happened to possess a cricket team\r\nwhich could make a good game with most of the second-rank clubs. The\r\ndisappearance to the East of two of the best bats of the previous\r\nseason caused Mike's advent to be hailed with a good deal of\r\nenthusiasm. Mike was a county man. He had only played once for his\r\ncounty, it was true, but that did not matter. He had passed the barrier\r\nwhich separates the second-class bat from the first-class, and the bank\r\nwelcomed him with awe. County men did not come their way every day.\r\n\r\nMike did not like being in the bank, considered in the light of a\r\ncareer. But he bore no grudge against the inmates of the bank, such as\r\nhe had borne against the inmates of Sedleigh. He had looked on the\r\nlatter as bound up with the school, and, consequently, enemies. His\r\nfellow workers in the bank he regarded as companions in misfortune.\r\nThey were all in the same boat together. There were men from Tonbridge,\r\nDulwich, Bedford, St Paul's, and a dozen other schools. One or two of\r\nthem he knew by repute from the pages of Wisden. Bannister, his\r\ncheerful predecessor in the Postage Department, was the Bannister, he\r\nrecollected now, who had played for Geddington against Wrykyn in his\r\nsecond year in the Wrykyn team. Munroe, the big man in the Fixed\r\nDeposits, he remembered as leader of the Ripton pack. Every day brought\r\nfresh discoveries of this sort, and each made Mike more reconciled to\r\nhis lot. They were a pleasant set of fellows in the New Asiatic Bank,\r\nand but for the dreary outlook which the future held--for Mike, unlike\r\nmost of his follow workers, was not attracted by the idea of a life in\r\nthe East--he would have been very fairly content.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of Mr Bickersdyke was a slight drawback. Psmith had\r\ndeveloped a habit of taking Mike with him to the club of an evening;\r\nand this did not do anything towards wiping out of the manager's mind\r\nthe recollection of his former passage of arms with the Old Wrykinian.\r\nThe glass remaining Set Fair as far as Mr Rossiter's approval was\r\nconcerned, Mike was enabled to keep off the managerial carpet to a\r\ngreat extent; but twice, when he posted letters without going through\r\nthe preliminary formality of stamping them, Mr Bickersdyke had\r\nopportunities of which he availed himself. But for these incidents life\r\nwas fairly enjoyable. Owing to Psmith's benevolent efforts, the Postage\r\nDepartment became quite a happy family, and ex-occupants of the postage\r\ndesk, Bannister especially, were amazed at the change that had come\r\nover Mr Rossiter. He no longer darted from his lair like a pouncing\r\npanther. To report his subordinates to the manager seemed now to be a\r\nlost art with him. The sight of Psmith and Mr Rossiter proceeding high\r\nand disposedly to a mutual lunch became quite common, and ceased to\r\nexcite remark.\r\n\r\n'By kindness,' said Psmith to Mike, after one of these expeditions. 'By\r\ntact and kindness. That is how it is done. I do not despair of training\r\nComrade Rossiter one of these days to jump through paper hoops.'\r\n\r\nSo that, altogether, Mike's life in the bank had become very fairly\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nOut of office-hours he enjoyed himself hugely. London was strange to\r\nhim, and with Psmith as a companion, he extracted a vast deal of\r\nentertainment from it. Psmith was not unacquainted with the West End,\r\nand he proved an excellent guide. At first Mike expostulated with\r\nunfailing regularity at the other's habit of paying for everything, but\r\nPsmith waved aside all objections with languid firmness.\r\n\r\n'I need you, Comrade Jackson,' he said, when Mike lodged a protest on\r\nfinding himself bound for the stalls for the second night in\r\nsuccession. 'We must stick together. As my confidential secretary and\r\nadviser, your place is by my side. Who knows but that between the acts\r\ntonight I may not be seized with some luminous thought? Could I utter\r\nthis to my next-door neighbour or the programme-girl? Stand by me,\r\nComrade Jackson, or we are undone.'\r\n\r\nSo Mike stood by him.\r\n\r\nBy this time Mike had grown so used to his work that he could tell to\r\nwithin five minutes when a rush would come; and he was able to spend a\r\ngood deal of his time reading a surreptitious novel behind a pile of\r\nledgers, or down in the tea-room. The New Asiatic Bank supplied tea to\r\nits employees. In quality it was bad, and the bread-and-butter\r\nassociated with it was worse. But it had the merit of giving one an\r\nexcuse for being away from one's desk. There were large printed notices\r\nall over the tea-room, which was in the basement, informing gentlemen\r\nthat they were only allowed ten minutes for tea, but one took just as\r\nlong as one thought the head of one's department would stand, from\r\ntwenty-five minutes to an hour and a quarter.\r\n\r\nThis state of things was too good to last. Towards the beginning of the\r\nNew Year a new man arrived, and Mike was moved on to another\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Mr Waller Appears in a New Light\r\n\r\n\r\nThe department into which Mike was sent was the Cash, or, to be more\r\nexact, that section of it which was known as Paying Cashier. The\r\nimportant task of shooting doubloons across the counter did not belong\r\nto Mike himself, but to Mr Waller. Mike's work was less ostentatious,\r\nand was performed with pen, ink, and ledgers in the background.\r\nOccasionally, when Mr Waller was out at lunch, Mike had to act as\r\nsubstitute for him, and cash cheques; but Mr Waller always went out at\r\na slack time, when few customers came in, and Mike seldom had any very\r\nstartling sum to hand over.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed being in the Cash Department. He liked Mr Waller. The work\r\nwas easy; and when he did happen to make mistakes, they were corrected\r\npatiently by the grey-bearded one, and not used as levers for boosting\r\nhim into the presence of Mr Bickersdyke, as they might have been in\r\nsome departments. The cashier seemed to have taken a fancy to Mike; and\r\nMike, as was usually the way with him when people went out of their way\r\nto be friendly, was at his best. Mike at his ease and unsuspicious of\r\nhostile intentions was a different person from Mike with his prickles\r\nout.\r\n\r\nPsmith, meanwhile, was not enjoying himself. It was an unheard-of\r\nthing, he said, depriving a man of his confidential secretary without\r\nso much as asking his leave.\r\n\r\n'It has caused me the greatest inconvenience,' he told Mike, drifting\r\nround in a melancholy way to the Cash Department during a slack spell\r\none afternoon. 'I miss you at every turn. Your keen intelligence and\r\nready sympathy were invaluable to me. Now where am I? In the cart. I\r\nevolved a slightly bright thought on life just now. There was nobody to\r\ntell it to except the new man. I told it him, and the fool gaped. I\r\ntell you, Comrade Jackson, I feel like some lion that has been robbed\r\nof its cub. I feel as Marshall would feel if they took Snelgrove away\r\nfrom him, or as Peace might if he awoke one morning to find Plenty\r\ngone. Comrade Rossiter does his best. We still talk brokenly about\r\nManchester United--they got routed in the first round of the Cup\r\nyesterday and Comrade Rossiter is wearing black--but it is not the\r\nsame. I try work, but that is no good either. From ledger to ledger\r\nthey hurry me, to stifle my regret. And when they win a smile from me,\r\nthey think that I forget. But I don't. I am a broken man. That new\r\nexhibit they've got in your place is about as near to the Extreme Edge\r\nas anything I've ever seen. One of Nature's blighters. Well, well, I\r\nmust away. Comrade Rossiter awaits me.'\r\n\r\nMike's successor, a youth of the name of Bristow, was causing Psmith a\r\ngreat deal of pensive melancholy. His worst defect--which he could not\r\nhelp--was that he was not Mike. His others--which he could--were\r\nnumerous. His clothes were cut in a way that harrowed Psmith's sensitive\r\nsoul every time he looked at them. The fact that he wore detachable\r\ncuffs, which he took off on beginning work and stacked in a glistening\r\npile on the desk in front of him, was no proof of innate viciousness of\r\ndisposition, but it prejudiced the Old Etonian against him. It was part\r\nof Psmith's philosophy that a man who wore detachable cuffs had passed\r\nbeyond the limit of human toleration. In addition, Bristow wore a small\r\nblack moustache and a ring and that, as Psmith informed Mike, put the\r\nlid on it.\r\n\r\nMike would sometimes stroll round to the Postage Department to listen\r\nto the conversations between the two. Bristow was always friendliness\r\nitself. He habitually addressed Psmith as Smithy, a fact which\r\nentertained Mike greatly but did not seem to amuse Psmith to any\r\noverwhelming extent. On the other hand, when, as he generally did, he\r\ncalled Mike 'Mister Cricketer', the humour of the thing appeared to\r\nelude Mike, though the mode of address always drew from Psmith a pale,\r\nwan smile, as of a broken heart made cheerful against its own\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nThe net result of the coming of Bristow was that Psmith spent most of\r\nhis time, when not actually oppressed by a rush of work, in the\r\nprecincts of the Cash Department, talking to Mike and Mr Waller. The\r\nlatter did not seem to share the dislike common among the other heads\r\nof departments of seeing his subordinates receiving visitors. Unless\r\nthe work was really heavy, in which case a mild remonstrance escaped\r\nhim, he offered no objection to Mike being at home to Psmith. It was\r\nthis tolerance which sometimes got him into trouble with Mr\r\nBickersdyke. The manager did not often perambulate the office, but he\r\ndid occasionally, and the interview which ensued upon his finding\r\nHutchinson, the underling in the Cash Department at that time, with his\r\nstool tilted comfortably against the wall, reading the sporting news\r\nfrom a pink paper to a friend from the Outward Bills Department who lay\r\nluxuriously on the floor beside him, did not rank among Mr Waller's\r\npleasantest memories. But Mr Waller was too soft-hearted to interfere\r\nwith his assistants unless it was absolutely necessary. The truth of\r\nthe matter was that the New Asiatic Bank was over-staffed. There were\r\ntoo many men for the work. The London branch of the bank was really\r\nonly a nursery. New men were constantly wanted in the Eastern branches,\r\nso they had to be put into the London branch to learn the business,\r\nwhether there was any work for them to do or not.\r\n\r\nIt was after one of these visits of Psmith's that Mr Waller displayed a\r\nnew and unsuspected side to his character. Psmith had come round in a\r\nstate of some depression to discuss Bristow, as usual. Bristow, it\r\nseemed, had come to the bank that morning in a fancy waistcoat of so\r\nemphatic a colour-scheme that Psmith stoutly refused to sit in the same\r\ndepartment with it.\r\n\r\n'What with Comrades Bristow and Bickersdyke combined,' said Psmith\r\nplaintively, 'the work is becoming too hard for me. The whisper is\r\nbeginning to circulate, \"Psmith's number is up--As a reformer he is\r\nmerely among those present. He is losing his dash.\" But what can I do?\r\nI cannot keep an eye on both of them at the same time. The moment I\r\nconcentrate myself on Comrade Bickersdyke for a brief spell, and seem\r\nto be doing him a bit of good, what happens? Why, Comrade Bristow\r\nsneaks off and buys a sort of woollen sunset. I saw the thing\r\nunexpectedly. I tell you I was shaken. It is the suddenness of that\r\nwaistcoat which hits you. It's discouraging, this sort of thing. I try\r\nalways to think well of my fellow man. As an energetic Socialist, I do\r\nmy best to see the good that is in him, but it's hard. Comrade\r\nBristow's the most striking argument against the equality of man I've\r\never come across.'\r\n\r\nMr Waller intervened at this point.\r\n\r\n'I think you must really let Jackson go on with his work, Smith,' he\r\nsaid. 'There seems to be too much talking.'\r\n\r\n'My besetting sin,' said Psmith sadly. 'Well, well, I will go back and\r\ndo my best to face it, but it's a tough job.'\r\n\r\nHe tottered wearily away in the direction of the Postage Department.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Jackson,' said Mr Waller, 'will you kindly take my place for a few\r\nminutes? I must go round and see the Inward Bills about something. I\r\nshall be back very soon.'\r\n\r\nMike was becoming accustomed to deputizing for the cashier for short\r\nspaces of time. It generally happened that he had to do so once or\r\ntwice a day. Strictly speaking, perhaps, Mr Waller was wrong to leave\r\nsuch an important task as the actual cashing of cheques to an\r\ninexperienced person of Mike's standing; but the New Asiatic Bank\r\ndiffered from most banks in that there was not a great deal of\r\ncross-counter work. People came in fairly frequently to cash cheques\r\nof two or three pounds, but it was rare that any very large dealings\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nHaving completed his business with the Inward Bills, Mr Waller made his\r\nway back by a circuitous route, taking in the Postage desk.\r\n\r\nHe found Psmith with a pale, set face, inscribing figures in a ledger.\r\nThe Old Etonian greeted him with the faint smile of a persecuted saint\r\nwho is determined to be cheerful even at the stake.\r\n\r\n'Comrade Bristow,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Smithy?' said the other, turning.\r\n\r\nPsmith sadly directed Mr Waller's attention to the waistcoat, which was\r\ncertainly definite in its colouring.\r\n\r\n'Nothing,' said Psmith. 'I only wanted to look at you.'\r\n\r\n'Funny ass,' said Bristow, resuming his work. Psmith glanced at Mr\r\nWaller, as who should say, 'See what I have to put up with. And yet I\r\ndo not give way.'\r\n\r\n'Oh--er--Smith,' said Mr Waller, 'when you were talking to Jackson just\r\nnow--'\r\n\r\n'Say no more,' said Psmith. 'It shall not occur again. Why should I\r\ndislocate the work of your department in my efforts to win a\r\nsympathetic word? I will bear Comrade Bristow like a man here. After\r\nall, there are worse things at the Zoo.'\r\n\r\n'No, no,' said Mr Waller hastily, 'I did not mean that. By all means\r\npay us a visit now and then, if it does not interfere with your own\r\nwork. But I noticed just now that you spoke to Bristow as Comrade\r\nBristow.'\r\n\r\n'It is too true,' said Psmith. 'I must correct myself of the habit. He\r\nwill be getting above himself.'\r\n\r\n'And when you were speaking to Jackson, you spoke of yourself as a\r\nSocialist.'\r\n\r\n'Socialism is the passion of my life,' said Psmith.\r\n\r\nMr Waller's face grew animated. He stammered in his eagerness.\r\n\r\n'I am delighted,' he said. 'Really, I am delighted. I also--'\r\n\r\n'A fellow worker in the Cause?' said Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Er--exactly.'\r\n\r\nPsmith extended his hand gravely. Mr Waller shook it with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n'I have never liked to speak of it to anybody in the office,' said Mr\r\nWaller, 'but I, too, am heart and soul in the movement.'\r\n\r\n'Yours for the Revolution?' said Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Just so. Just so. Exactly. I was wondering--the fact is, I am in the\r\nhabit of speaking on Sundays in the open air, and--'\r\n\r\n'Hyde Park?'\r\n\r\n'No. No. Clapham Common. It is--er--handier for me where I live. Now,\r\nas you are interested in the movement, I was thinking that perhaps you\r\nmight care to come and hear me speak next Sunday. Of course, if you\r\nhave nothing better to do.'\r\n\r\n'I should like to excessively,' said Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Excellent. Bring Jackson with you, and both of you come to supper\r\nafterwards, if you will.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks very much.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you would speak yourself?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Psmith. 'No. I think not. My Socialism is rather of the\r\npractical sort. I seldom speak. But it would be a treat to listen to\r\nyou. What--er--what type of oratory is yours?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well,' said Mr Waller, pulling nervously at his beard, 'of course\r\nI--. Well, I am perhaps a little bitter--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes.'\r\n\r\n'A little mordant and ironical.'\r\n\r\n'You would be,' agreed Psmith. 'I shall look forward to Sunday with\r\nevery fibre quivering. And Comrade Jackson shall be at my side.'\r\n\r\n'Excellent,' said Mr Waller. 'I will go and tell him now.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Stirring Times on the Common\r\n\r\n\r\n'The first thing to do,' said Psmith, 'is to ascertain that such a\r\nplace as Clapham Common really exists. One has heard of it, of course,\r\nbut has its existence ever been proved? I think not. Having\r\naccomplished that, we must then try to find out how to get to it. I\r\nshould say at a venture that it would necessitate a sea-voyage. On the\r\nother hand, Comrade Waller, who is a native of the spot, seems to find\r\nno difficulty in rolling to the office every morning. Therefore--you\r\nfollow me, Jackson?--it must be in England. In that case, we will take\r\na taximeter cab, and go out into the unknown, hand in hand, trusting to\r\nluck.'\r\n\r\n'I expect you could get there by tram,' said Mike.\r\n\r\nPsmith suppressed a slight shudder.\r\n\r\n'I fear, Comrade Jackson,' he said, 'that the old noblesse oblige\r\ntraditions of the Psmiths would not allow me to do that. No. We will\r\nstroll gently, after a light lunch, to Trafalgar Square, and hail a\r\ntaxi.'\r\n\r\n'Beastly expensive.'\r\n\r\n'But with what an object! Can any expenditure be called excessive which\r\nenables us to hear Comrade Waller being mordant and ironical at the\r\nother end?'\r\n\r\n'It's a rum business,' said Mike. 'I hope the dickens he won't mix us\r\nup in it. We should look frightful fools.'\r\n\r\n'I may possibly say a few words,' said Psmith carelessly, 'if the\r\nspirit moves me. Who am I that I should deny people a simple pleasure?'\r\n\r\nMike looked alarmed.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said, 'I say, if you _are_ going to play the goat,\r\nfor goodness' sake don't go lugging me into it. I've got heaps of\r\ntroubles without that.'\r\n\r\nPsmith waved the objection aside.\r\n\r\n'You,' he said, 'will be one of the large, and, I hope, interested\r\naudience. Nothing more. But it is quite possible that the spirit may\r\nnot move me. I may not feel inspired to speak. I am not one of those\r\nwho love speaking for speaking's sake. If I have no message for the\r\nmany-headed, I shall remain silent.'\r\n\r\n'Then I hope the dickens you won't have,' said Mike. Of all things he\r\nhated most being conspicuous before a crowd--except at cricket, which\r\nwas a different thing--and he had an uneasy feeling that Psmith would\r\nrather like it than otherwise.\r\n\r\n'We shall see,' said Psmith absently. 'Of course, if in the vein, I\r\nmight do something big in the way of oratory. I am a plain, blunt man,\r\nbut I feel convinced that, given the opportunity, I should haul up my\r\nslacks to some effect. But--well, we shall see. We shall see.'\r\n\r\nAnd with this ghastly state of doubt Mike had to be content.\r\n\r\nIt was with feelings of apprehension that he accompanied Psmith from\r\nthe flat to Trafalgar Square in search of a cab which should convey\r\nthem to Clapham Common.\r\n\r\nThey were to meet Mr Waller at the edge of the Common nearest the\r\nold town of Clapham. On the journey down Psmith was inclined to be\r\n_debonnaire_. Mike, on the other hand, was silent and apprehensive.\r\nHe knew enough of Psmith to know that, if half an opportunity were\r\noffered him, he would extract entertainment from this affair after\r\nhis own fashion; and then the odds were that he himself would be\r\ndragged into it. Perhaps--his scalp bristled at the mere idea--he\r\nwould even be let in for a speech.\r\n\r\nThis grisly thought had hardly come into his head, when Psmith spoke.\r\n\r\n'I'm not half sure,' he said thoughtfully, 'I sha'n't call on you for a\r\nspeech, Comrade Jackson.'\r\n\r\n'Look here, Psmith--' began Mike agitatedly.\r\n\r\n'I don't know. I think your solid, incisive style would rather go down\r\nwith the masses. However, we shall see, we shall see.'\r\n\r\nMike reached the Common in a state of nervous collapse.\r\n\r\nMr Waller was waiting for them by the railings near the pond. The\r\napostle of the Revolution was clad soberly in black, except for a tie\r\nof vivid crimson. His eyes shone with the light of enthusiasm, vastly\r\ndifferent from the mild glow of amiability which they exhibited for six\r\ndays in every week. The man was transformed.\r\n\r\n'Here you are,' he said. 'Here you are. Excellent. You are in good\r\ntime. Comrades Wotherspoon and Prebble have already begun to speak. I\r\nshall commence now that you have come. This is the way. Over by these\r\ntrees.'\r\n\r\nThey made their way towards a small clump of trees, near which a\r\nfair-sized crowd had already begun to collect. Evidently listening\r\nto the speakers was one of Clapham's fashionable Sunday amusements. Mr\r\nWaller talked and gesticulated incessantly as he walked. Psmith's\r\ndemeanour was perhaps a shade patronizing, but he displayed interest.\r\nMike proceeded to the meeting with the air of an about-to-be-washed dog.\r\nHe was loathing the whole business with a heartiness worthy of a better\r\ncause. Somehow, he felt he was going to be made to look a fool before\r\nthe afternoon was over. But he registered a vow that nothing should\r\ndrag him on to the small platform which had been erected for the\r\nbenefit of the speaker.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer, the voices of Comrades Wotherspoon and Prebble\r\nbecame more audible. They had been audible all the time, very much so,\r\nbut now they grew in volume. Comrade Wotherspoon was a tall, thin man\r\nwith side-whiskers and a high voice. He scattered his aitches as a\r\nfountain its sprays in a strong wind. He was very earnest. Comrade\r\nPrebble was earnest, too. Perhaps even more so than Comrade\r\nWotherspoon. He was handicapped to some extent, however, by not having\r\na palate. This gave to his profoundest thoughts a certain weirdness, as\r\nif they had been uttered in an unknown tongue. The crowd was thickest\r\nround his platform. The grown-up section plainly regarded him as a\r\ncomedian, pure and simple, and roared with happy laughter when he urged\r\nthem to march upon Park Lane and loot the same without mercy or\r\nscruple. The children were more doubtful. Several had broken down, and\r\nbeen led away in tears.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Waller got up to speak on platform number three, his audience\r\nconsisted at first only of Psmith, Mike, and a fox-terrier. Gradually\r\nhowever, he attracted others. After wavering for a while, the crowd\r\nfinally decided that he was worth hearing. He had a method of his own.\r\nLacking the natural gifts which marked Comrade Prebble out as an\r\nentertainer, he made up for this by his activity. Where his colleagues\r\nstood comparatively still, Mr Waller behaved with the vivacity\r\ngenerally supposed to belong only to peas on shovels and cats on hot\r\nbricks. He crouched to denounce the House of Lords. He bounded from\r\nside to side while dissecting the methods of the plutocrats. During an\r\nimpassioned onslaught on the monarchical system he stood on one leg and\r\nhopped. This was more the sort of thing the crowd had come to see.\r\nComrade Wotherspoon found himself deserted, and even Comrade Prebble's\r\nshortcomings in the way of palate were insufficient to keep his flock\r\ntogether. The entire strength of the audience gathered in front of the\r\nthird platform.\r\n\r\nMike, separated from Psmith by the movement of the crowd, listened with\r\na growing depression. That feeling which attacks a sensitive person\r\nsometimes at the theatre when somebody is making himself ridiculous on\r\nthe stage--the illogical feeling that it is he and not the actor who is\r\nfloundering--had come over him in a wave. He liked Mr Waller, and it\r\nmade his gorge rise to see him exposing himself to the jeers of a\r\ncrowd. The fact that Mr Waller himself did not know that they were\r\njeers, but mistook them for applause, made it no better. Mike felt\r\nvaguely furious.\r\n\r\nHis indignation began to take a more personal shape when the speaker,\r\nbranching off from the main subject of Socialism, began to touch on\r\ntemperance. There was no particular reason why Mr Waller should have\r\nintroduced the subject of temperance, except that he happened to be an\r\nenthusiast. He linked it on to his remarks on Socialism by attributing\r\nthe lethargy of the masses to their fondness for alcohol; and the\r\ncrowd, which had been inclined rather to pat itself on the back during\r\nthe assaults on Rank and Property, finding itself assailed in its turn,\r\nresented it. They were there to listen to speakers telling them that\r\nthey were the finest fellows on earth, not pointing out their little\r\nfailings to them. The feeling of the meeting became hostile. The jeers\r\ngrew more frequent and less good-tempered.\r\n\r\n'Comrade Waller means well,' said a voice in Mike's ear, 'but if he\r\nshoots it at them like this much more there'll be a bit of an\r\nimbroglio.'\r\n\r\n'Look here, Smith,' said Mike quickly, 'can't we stop him? These chaps\r\nare getting fed up, and they look bargees enough to do anything.\r\nThey'll be going for him or something soon.'\r\n\r\n'How can we switch off the flow? I don't see. The man is wound up. He\r\nmeans to get it off his chest if it snows. I feel we are by way of\r\nbeing in the soup once more, Comrade Jackson. We can only sit tight and\r\nlook on.'\r\n\r\nThe crowd was becoming more threatening every minute. A group of young\r\nmen of the loafer class who stood near Mike were especially fertile in\r\ncomment. Psmith's eyes were on the speaker; but Mike was watching this\r\ngroup closely. Suddenly he saw one of them, a thick-set youth wearing a\r\ncloth cap and no collar, stoop.\r\n\r\nWhen he rose again there was a stone in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe sight acted on Mike like a spur. Vague rage against nobody in\r\nparticular had been simmering in him for half an hour. Now it\r\nconcentrated itself on the cloth-capped one.\r\n\r\nMr Waller paused momentarily before renewing his harangue. The man in\r\nthe cloth cap raised his hand. There was a swirl in the crowd, and the\r\nfirst thing that Psmith saw as he turned was Mike seizing the would-be\r\nmarksman round the neck and hurling him to the ground, after the manner\r\nof a forward at football tackling an opponent during a line-out from\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which will always distract the attention of a crowd\r\nfrom any speaker, and that is a dispute between two of its units. Mr\r\nWaller's views on temperance were forgotten in an instant. The audience\r\nsurged round Mike and his opponent.\r\n\r\nThe latter had scrambled to his feet now, and was looking round for his\r\nassailant.\r\n\r\n'That's 'im, Bill!' cried eager voices, indicating Mike.\r\n\r\n''E's the bloke wot 'it yer, Bill,' said others, more precise in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nBill advanced on Mike in a sidelong, crab-like manner.\r\n\r\n''Oo're you, I should like to know?' said Bill.\r\n\r\nMike, rightly holding that this was merely a rhetorical question and\r\nthat Bill had no real thirst for information as to his family history,\r\nmade no reply. Or, rather, the reply he made was not verbal. He waited\r\ntill his questioner was within range, and then hit him in the eye. A\r\nreply far more satisfactory, if not to Bill himself, at any rate to the\r\ninterested onlookers, than any flow of words.\r\n\r\nA contented sigh went up from the crowd. Their Sunday afternoon was\r\ngoing to be spent just as they considered Sunday afternoons should be\r\nspent.\r\n\r\n'Give us your coat,' said Psmith briskly, 'and try and get it over\r\nquick. Don't go in for any fancy sparring. Switch it on, all you know,\r\nfrom the start. I'll keep a thoughtful eye open to see that none of his\r\nfriends and relations join in.'\r\n\r\nOutwardly Psmith was unruffled, but inwardly he was not feeling so\r\ncomposed. An ordinary turn-up before an impartial crowd which could be\r\nrelied upon to preserve the etiquette of these matters was one thing.\r\nAs regards the actual little dispute with the cloth-capped Bill, he\r\nfelt that he could rely on Mike to handle it satisfactorily. But there\r\nwas no knowing how long the crowd would be content to remain mere\r\nspectators. There was no doubt which way its sympathies lay. Bill, now\r\nstripped of his coat and sketching out in a hoarse voice a scenario of\r\nwhat he intended to do--knocking Mike down and stamping him into the\r\nmud was one of the milder feats he promised to perform for the\r\nentertainment of an indulgent audience--was plainly the popular\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\nPsmith, though he did not show it, was more than a little apprehensive.\r\n\r\nMike, having more to occupy his mind in the immediate present, was not\r\nanxious concerning the future. He had the great advantage over Psmith\r\nof having lost his temper. Psmith could look on the situation as a\r\nwhole, and count the risks and possibilities. Mike could only see Bill\r\nshuffling towards him with his head down and shoulders bunched.\r\n\r\n'Gow it, Bill!' said someone.\r\n\r\n'Pliy up, the Arsenal!' urged a voice on the outskirts of the crowd.\r\n\r\nA chorus of encouragement from kind friends in front: 'Step up, Bill!'\r\n\r\nAnd Bill stepped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Further Developments\r\n\r\n\r\nBill (surname unknown) was not one of your ultra-scientific fighters.\r\nHe did not favour the American crouch and the artistic feint. He had a\r\nstyle wholly his own. It seemed to have been modelled partly on a\r\ntortoise and partly on a windmill. His head he appeared to be trying to\r\nconceal between his shoulders, and he whirled his arms alternately in\r\ncircular sweeps.\r\n\r\nMike, on the other hand, stood upright and hit straight, with the\r\nresult that he hurt his knuckles very much on his opponent's skull,\r\nwithout seeming to disturb the latter to any great extent. In the\r\nprocess he received one of the windmill swings on the left ear. The\r\ncrowd, strong pro-Billites, raised a cheer.\r\n\r\nThis maddened Mike. He assumed the offensive. Bill, satisfied for the\r\nmoment with his success, had stepped back, and was indulging in some\r\nfancy sparring, when Mike sprang upon him like a panther. They\r\nclinched, and Mike, who had got the under grip, hurled Bill forcibly\r\nagainst a stout man who looked like a publican. The two fell in a heap,\r\nBill underneath.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Bill's friends joined in.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation Mike had of this was a violent blow across the\r\nshoulders with a walking-stick. Even if he had been wearing his\r\novercoat, the blow would have hurt. As he was in his jacket it hurt\r\nmore than anything he had ever experienced in his life. He leapt up\r\nwith a yell, but Psmith was there before him. Mike saw his assailant\r\nlift the stick again, and then collapse as the old Etonian's right took\r\nhim under the chin.\r\n\r\nHe darted to Psmith's side.\r\n\r\n'This is no place for us,' observed the latter sadly. 'Shift ho, I\r\nthink. Come on.'\r\n\r\nThey dashed simultaneously for the spot where the crowd was thinnest.\r\nThe ring which had formed round Mike and Bill had broken up as the\r\nresult of the intervention of Bill's allies, and at the spot for which\r\nthey ran only two men were standing. And these had apparently made up\r\ntheir minds that neutrality was the best policy, for they made no\r\nmovement to stop them. Psmith and Mike charged through the gap, and\r\nraced for the road.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of the move gave them just the start they needed. Mike\r\nlooked over his shoulder. The crowd, to a man, seemed to be following.\r\nBill, excavated from beneath the publican, led the field. Lying a good\r\nsecond came a band of three, and after them the rest in a bunch.\r\n\r\nThey reached the road in this order.\r\n\r\nSome fifty yards down the road was a stationary tram. In the ordinary\r\ncourse of things it would probably have moved on long before Psmith and\r\nMike could have got to it; but the conductor, a man with sporting blood\r\nin him, seeing what appeared to be the finish of some Marathon Race,\r\nrefrained from giving the signal, and moved out into the road to\r\nobserve events more clearly, at the same time calling to the driver,\r\nwho joined him. Passengers on the roof stood up to get a good view.\r\nThere was some cheering.\r\n\r\nPsmith and Mike reached the tram ten yards to the good; and, if it had\r\nbeen ready to start then, all would have been well. But Bill and his\r\nfriends had arrived while the driver and conductor were both out in the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThe affair now began to resemble the doings of Horatius on the bridge.\r\nPsmith and Mike turned to bay on the platform at the foot of the tram\r\nsteps. Bill, leading by three yards, sprang on to it, grabbed Mike, and\r\nfell with him on to the road. Psmith, descending with a dignity\r\nsomewhat lessened by the fact that his hat was on the side of his head,\r\nwas in time to engage the runners-up.\r\n\r\nPsmith, as pugilist, lacked something of the calm majesty which\r\ncharacterized him in the more peaceful moments of life, but he was\r\nundoubtedly effective. Nature had given him an enormous reach and a\r\nlightness on his feet remarkable in one of his size; and at some time\r\nin his career he appeared to have learned how to use his hands. The\r\nfirst of the three runners, the walking-stick manipulator, had the\r\nmisfortune to charge straight into the old Etonian's left. It was a\r\nwell-timed blow, and the force of it, added to the speed at which the\r\nvictim was running, sent him on to the pavement, where he spun round\r\nand sat down. In the subsequent proceedings he took no part.\r\n\r\nThe other two attacked Psmith simultaneously, one on each side. In\r\ndoing so, the one on the left tripped over Mike and Bill, who were\r\nstill in the process of sorting themselves out, and fell, leaving\r\nPsmith free to attend to the other. He was a tall, weedy youth. His\r\nconspicuous features were a long nose and a light yellow waistcoat.\r\nPsmith hit him on the former with his left and on the latter with his\r\nright. The long youth emitted a gurgle, and collided with Bill, who had\r\nwrenched himself free from Mike and staggered to his feet. Bill, having\r\nreceived a second blow in the eye during the course of his interview on\r\nthe road with Mike, was not feeling himself. Mistaking the other for an\r\nenemy, he proceeded to smite him in the parts about the jaw. He had\r\njust upset him, when a stern official voice observed, ''Ere, now,\r\nwhat's all this?'\r\n\r\nThere is no more unfailing corrective to a scene of strife than the\r\n'What's all this?' of the London policeman. Bill abandoned his\r\nintention of stamping on the prostrate one, and the latter, sitting up,\r\nblinked and was silent.\r\n\r\n'What's all this?' asked the policeman again. Psmith, adjusting his hat\r\nat the correct angle again, undertook the explanations.\r\n\r\n'A distressing scene, officer,' he said. 'A case of that unbridled\r\nbrawling which is, alas, but too common in our London streets. These\r\ntwo, possibly till now the closest friends, fall out over some point,\r\nprobably of the most trivial nature, and what happens? They brawl.\r\nThey--'\r\n\r\n'He 'it me,' said the long youth, dabbing at his face with a\r\nhandkerchief and pointing an accusing finger at Psmith, who regarded\r\nhim through his eyeglass with a look in which pity and censure were\r\nnicely blended.\r\n\r\nBill, meanwhile, circling round restlessly, in the apparent hope of\r\ngetting past the Law and having another encounter with Mike, expressed\r\nhimself in a stream of language which drew stern reproof from the\r\nshocked constable.\r\n\r\n'You 'op it,' concluded the man in blue. 'That's what you do. You 'op\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'I should,' said Psmith kindly. 'The officer is speaking in your best\r\ninterests. A man of taste and discernment, he knows what is best. His\r\nadvice is good, and should be followed.'\r\n\r\nThe constable seemed to notice Psmith for the first time. He turned and\r\nstared at him. Psmith's praise had not had the effect of softening him.\r\nHis look was one of suspicion.\r\n\r\n'And what might _you_ have been up to?' he inquired coldly. 'This\r\nman says you hit him.'\r\n\r\nPsmith waved the matter aside.\r\n\r\n'Purely in self-defence,' he said, 'purely in self-defence. What else\r\ncould the man of spirit do? A mere tap to discourage an aggressive\r\nmovement.'\r\n\r\nThe policeman stood silent, weighing matters in the balance. He\r\nproduced a notebook and sucked his pencil. Then he called the conductor\r\nof the tram as a witness.\r\n\r\n'A brainy and admirable step,' said Psmith, approvingly. 'This rugged,\r\nhonest man, all unused to verbal subtleties, shall give us his plain\r\naccount of what happened. After which, as I presume this tram--little\r\nas I know of the habits of trams--has got to go somewhere today, I\r\nwould suggest that we all separated and moved on.'\r\n\r\nHe took two half-crowns from his pocket, and began to clink them\r\nmeditatively together. A slight softening of the frigidity of the\r\nconstable's manner became noticeable. There was a milder beam in the\r\neyes which gazed into Psmith's.\r\n\r\nNor did the conductor seem altogether uninfluenced by the sight.\r\n\r\nThe conductor deposed that he had bin on the point of pushing on,\r\nseeing as how he'd hung abart long enough, when he see'd them two\r\ngents, the long 'un with the heye-glass (Psmith bowed) and t'other 'un,\r\na-legging of it dahn the road towards him, with the other blokes\r\npelting after 'em. He added that, when they reached the trem, the two\r\ngents had got aboard, and was then set upon by the blokes. And after\r\nthat, he concluded, well, there was a bit of a scrap, and that's how it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n'Lucidly and excellently put,' said Psmith. 'That is just how it was.\r\nComrade Jackson, I fancy we leave the court without a stain on our\r\ncharacters. We win through. Er--constable, we have given you a great\r\ndeal of trouble. Possibly--?'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.' There was a musical clinking. 'Now then, all of you,\r\nyou 'op it. You're all bin poking your noses in 'ere long enough. Pop\r\noff. Get on with that tram, conductor.' Psmith and Mike settled\r\nthemselves in a seat on the roof. When the conductor came along, Psmith\r\ngave him half a crown, and asked after his wife and the little ones at\r\nhome. The conductor thanked goodness that he was a bachelor, punched\r\nthe tickets, and retired.\r\n\r\n'Subject for a historical picture,' said Psmith. 'Wounded leaving the\r\nfield after the Battle of Clapham Common. How are your injuries,\r\nComrade Jackson?'\r\n\r\n'My back's hurting like blazes,' said Mike. 'And my ear's all sore\r\nwhere that chap got me. Anything the matter with you?'\r\n\r\n'Physically,' said Psmith, 'no. Spiritually much. Do you realize,\r\nComrade Jackson, the thing that has happened? I am riding in a tram. I,\r\nPsmith, have paid a penny for a ticket on a tram. If this should get\r\nabout the clubs! I tell you, Comrade Jackson, no such crisis has ever\r\noccurred before in the course of my career.'\r\n\r\n'You can always get off, you know,' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'He thinks of everything,' said Psmith, admiringly. 'You have touched\r\nthe spot with an unerring finger. Let us descend. I observe in the\r\ndistance a cab. That looks to me more the sort of thing we want. Let us\r\ngo and parley with the driver.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Sunday Supper\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cab took them back to the flat, at considerable expense, and Psmith\r\nrequested Mike to make tea, a performance in which he himself was\r\ninterested purely as a spectator. He had views on the subject of\r\ntea-making which he liked to expound from an armchair or sofa, but he\r\nnever got further than this. Mike, his back throbbing dully from the\r\nblow he had received, and feeling more than a little sore all over,\r\nprepared the Etna, fetched the milk, and finally produced the finished\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nPsmith sipped meditatively.\r\n\r\n'How pleasant,' he said, 'after strife is rest. We shouldn't have\r\nappreciated this simple cup of tea had our sensibilities remained\r\nunstirred this afternoon. We can now sit at our ease, like warriors\r\nafter the fray, till the time comes for setting out to Comrade Waller's\r\nonce more.'\r\n\r\nMike looked up.\r\n\r\n'What! You don't mean to say you're going to sweat out to Clapham\r\nagain?'\r\n\r\n'Undoubtedly. Comrade Waller is expecting us to supper.'\r\n\r\n'What absolute rot! We can't fag back there.'\r\n\r\n'Noblesse oblige. The cry has gone round the Waller household, \"Jackson\r\nand Psmith are coming to supper,\" and we cannot disappoint them now.\r\nAlready the fatted blanc-mange has been killed, and the table creaks\r\nbeneath what's left of the midday beef. We must be there; besides,\r\ndon't you want to see how the poor man is? Probably we shall find him\r\nin the act of emitting his last breath. I expect he was lynched by the\r\nenthusiastic mob.'\r\n\r\n'Not much,' grinned Mike. 'They were too busy with us. All right, I'll\r\ncome if you really want me to, but it's awful rot.'\r\n\r\nOne of the many things Mike could never understand in Psmith was his\r\nfondness for getting into atmospheres that were not his own. He would\r\ngo out of his way to do this. Mike, like most boys of his age, was\r\nnever really happy and at his ease except in the presence of those of\r\nhis own years and class. Psmith, on the contrary, seemed to be bored by\r\nthem, and infinitely preferred talking to somebody who lived in quite\r\nanother world. Mike was not a snob. He simply had not the ability to be\r\nat his ease with people in another class from his own. He did not know\r\nwhat to talk to them about, unless they were cricket professionals.\r\nWith them he was never at a loss.\r\n\r\nBut Psmith was different. He could get on with anyone. He seemed to\r\nhave the gift of entering into their minds and seeing things from their\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nAs regarded Mr Waller, Mike liked him personally, and was prepared, as\r\nwe have seen, to undertake considerable risks in his defence; but he\r\nloathed with all his heart and soul the idea of supper at his house. He\r\nknew that he would have nothing to say. Whereas Psmith gave him the\r\nimpression of looking forward to the thing as a treat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe house where Mr Waller lived was one of a row of semi-detached\r\nvillas on the north side of the Common. The door was opened to them by\r\ntheir host himself. So far from looking battered and emitting last\r\nbreaths, he appeared particularly spruce. He had just returned from\r\nChurch, and was still wearing his gloves and tall hat. He squeaked with\r\nsurprise when he saw who were standing on the mat.\r\n\r\n'Why, dear me, dear me,' he said. 'Here you are! I have been wondering\r\nwhat had happened to you. I was afraid that you might have been\r\nseriously hurt. I was afraid those ruffians might have injured you.\r\nWhen last I saw you, you were being--'\r\n\r\n'Chivvied,' interposed Psmith, with dignified melancholy. 'Do not let\r\nus try to wrap the fact up in pleasant words. We were being chivvied.\r\nWe were legging it with the infuriated mob at our heels. An ignominious\r\nposition for a Shropshire Psmith, but, after all, Napoleon did the\r\nsame.'\r\n\r\n'But what happened? I could not see. I only know that quite suddenly\r\nthe people seemed to stop listening to me, and all gathered round you\r\nand Jackson. And then I saw that Jackson was engaged in a fight with a\r\nyoung man.'\r\n\r\n'Comrade Jackson, I imagine, having heard a great deal about all men\r\nbeing equal, was anxious to test the theory, and see whether Comrade\r\nBill was as good a man as he was. The experiment was broken off\r\nprematurely, but I personally should be inclined to say that Comrade\r\nJackson had a shade the better of the exchanges.'\r\n\r\nMr Waller looked with interest at Mike, who shuffled and felt awkward.\r\nHe was hoping that Psmith would say nothing about the reason of his\r\nengaging Bill in combat. He had an uneasy feeling that Mr Waller's\r\ngratitude would be effusive and overpowering, and he did not wish to\r\npose as the brave young hero. There are moments when one does not feel\r\nequal to the _role_.\r\n\r\nFortunately, before Mr Waller had time to ask any further questions,\r\nthe supper-bell sounded, and they went into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nSunday supper, unless done on a large and informal scale, is probably\r\nthe most depressing meal in existence. There is a chill discomfort in\r\nthe round of beef, an icy severity about the open jam tart. The\r\nblancmange shivers miserably.\r\n\r\nSpirituous liquor helps to counteract the influence of these things,\r\nand so does exhilarating conversation. Unfortunately, at Mr Waller's\r\ntable there was neither. The cashier's views on temperance were not\r\nmerely for the platform; they extended to the home. And the company was\r\nnot of the exhilarating sort. Besides Psmith and Mike and their host,\r\nthere were four people present--Comrade Prebble, the orator; a young\r\nman of the name of Richards; Mr Waller's niece, answering to the name\r\nof Ada, who was engaged to Mr Richards; and Edward.\r\n\r\nEdward was Mr Waller's son. He was ten years old, wore a very tight\r\nEton suit, and had the peculiarly loathsome expression which a snub\r\nnose sometimes gives to the young.\r\n\r\nIt would have been plain to the most casual observer that Mr Waller was\r\nfond and proud of his son. The cashier was a widower, and after five\r\nminutes' acquaintance with Edward, Mike felt strongly that Mrs Waller\r\nwas the lucky one. Edward sat next to Mike, and showed a tendency to\r\nconcentrate his conversation on him. Psmith, at the opposite end of the\r\ntable, beamed in a fatherly manner upon the pair through his eyeglass.\r\n\r\nMike got on with small girls reasonably well. He preferred them at a\r\ndistance, but, if cornered by them, could put up a fairly good show.\r\nSmall boys, however, filled him with a sort of frozen horror. It was\r\nhis view that a boy should not be exhibited publicly until he reached\r\nan age when he might be in the running for some sort of colours at a\r\npublic school.\r\n\r\nEdward was one of those well-informed small boys. He opened on Mike\r\nwith the first mouthful.\r\n\r\n'Do you know the principal exports of Marseilles?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n'What?' said Mike coldly.\r\n\r\n'Do you know the principal exports of Marseilles? I do.'\r\n\r\n'Oh?' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'Yes. Do you know the capital of Madagascar?'\r\n\r\nMike, as crimson as the beef he was attacking, said he did not.\r\n\r\n'I do.'\r\n\r\n'Oh?' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'Who was the first king--'\r\n\r\n'You mustn't worry Mr Jackson, Teddy,' said Mr Waller, with a touch of\r\npride in his voice, as who should say 'There are not many boys of his\r\nage, I can tell you, who _could_ worry you with questions like\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\n'No, no, he likes it,' said Psmith, unnecessarily. 'He likes it. I\r\nalways hold that much may be learned by casual chit-chat across the\r\ndinner-table. I owe much of my own grasp of--'\r\n\r\n'I bet _you_ don't know what's the capital of Madagascar,'\r\ninterrupted Mike rudely.\r\n\r\n'I do,' said Edward. 'I can tell you the kings of Israel?' he added,\r\nturning to Mike. He seemed to have no curiosity as to the extent of\r\nPsmith's knowledge. Mike's appeared to fascinate him.\r\n\r\nMike helped himself to beetroot in moody silence.\r\n\r\nHis mouth was full when Comrade Prebble asked him a question. Comrade\r\nPrebble, as has been pointed out in an earlier part of the narrative,\r\nwas a good chap, but had no roof to his mouth.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon?' said Mike.\r\n\r\nComrade Prebble repeated his observation. Mike looked helplessly at\r\nPsmith, but Psmith's eyes were on his plate.\r\n\r\nMike felt he must venture on some answer.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said decidedly.\r\n\r\nComrade Prebble seemed slightly taken aback. There was an awkward\r\npause. Then Mr Waller, for whom his fellow Socialist's methods of\r\nconversation held no mysteries, interpreted.\r\n\r\n'The mustard, Prebble? Yes, yes. Would you mind passing Prebble the\r\nmustard, Mr Jackson?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, sorry,' gasped Mike, and, reaching out, upset the water-jug into\r\nthe open jam-tart.\r\n\r\nThrough the black mist which rose before his eyes as he leaped to his\r\nfeet and stammered apologies came the dispassionate voice of Master\r\nEdward Waller reminding him that mustard was first introduced into Peru\r\nby Cortez.\r\n\r\nHis host was all courtesy and consideration. He passed the matter off\r\ngenially. But life can never be quite the same after you have upset a\r\nwater-jug into an open jam-tart at the table of a comparative stranger.\r\nMike's nerve had gone. He ate on, but he was a broken man.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the table it became gradually apparent that things\r\nwere not going on altogether as they should have done. There was a sort\r\nof bleakness in the atmosphere. Young Mr Richards was looking like a\r\nstuffed fish, and the face of Mr Waller's niece was cold and set.\r\n\r\n'Why, come, come, Ada,' said Mr Waller, breezily, 'what's the matter?\r\nYou're eating nothing. What's George been saying to you?' he added\r\njocularly.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, uncle Robert,' replied Ada precisely, 'there's nothing the\r\nmatter. Nothing that Mr Richards can say to me can upset me.'\r\n\r\n'Mr Richards!' echoed Mr Waller in astonishment. How was he to know\r\nthat, during the walk back from church, the world had been transformed,\r\nGeorge had become Mr Richards, and all was over?\r\n\r\n'I assure you, Ada--' began that unfortunate young man. Ada turned a\r\nfrigid shoulder towards him.\r\n\r\n'Come, come,' said Mr Waller disturbed. 'What's all this? What's all\r\nthis?'\r\n\r\nHis niece burst into tears and left the room.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything more embarrassing to a guest than a family row, we\r\nhave yet to hear of it. Mike, scarlet to the extreme edges of his ears,\r\nconcentrated himself on his plate. Comrade Prebble made a great many\r\nremarks, which were probably illuminating, if they could have been\r\nunderstood. Mr Waller looked, astonished, at Mr Richards. Mr Richards,\r\npink but dogged, loosened his collar, but said nothing. Psmith, leaning\r\nforward, asked Master Edward Waller his opinion on the Licensing Bill.\r\n\r\n'We happened to have a word or two,' said Mr Richards at length, 'on\r\nthe way home from church on the subject of Women's Suffrage.'\r\n\r\n'That fatal topic!' murmured Psmith.\r\n\r\n'In Australia--' began Master Edward Waller.\r\n\r\n'I was rayther--well, rayther facetious about it,' continued Mr\r\nRichards.\r\n\r\nPsmith clicked his tongue sympathetically.\r\n\r\n'In Australia--' said Edward.\r\n\r\n'I went talking on, laughing and joking, when all of a sudden she flew\r\nout at me. How was I to know she was 'eart and soul in the movement?\r\nYou never told me,' he added accusingly to his host.\r\n\r\n'In Australia--' said Edward.\r\n\r\n'I'll go and try and get her round. How was I to know?'\r\n\r\nMr Richards thrust back his chair and bounded from the room.\r\n\r\n'Now, iawinyaw, iear oiler--' said Comrade Prebble judicially, but was\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n'How very disturbing!' said Mr Waller. 'I am so sorry that this should\r\nhave happened. Ada is such a touchy, sensitive girl. She--'\r\n\r\n'In Australia,' said Edward in even tones, 'they've _got_ Women's\r\nSuffrage already. Did _you_ know that?' he said to Mike.\r\n\r\nMike made no answer. His eyes were fixed on his plate. A bead of\r\nperspiration began to roll down his forehead. If his feelings could\r\nhave been ascertained at that moment, they would have been summed up in\r\nthe words, 'Death, where is thy sting?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Psmith Makes a Discovery\r\n\r\n\r\n'Women,' said Psmith, helping himself to trifle, and speaking with the\r\nair of one launched upon his special subject, 'are, one must recollect,\r\nlike--like--er, well, in fact, just so. Passing on lightly from that\r\nconclusion, let us turn for a moment to the Rights of Property, in\r\nconnection with which Comrade Prebble and yourself had so much that was\r\ninteresting to say this afternoon. Perhaps you'--he bowed in Comrade\r\nPrebble's direction--'would resume, for the benefit of Comrade Jackson--a\r\nnovice in the Cause, but earnest--your very lucid--'\r\n\r\nComrade Prebble beamed, and took the floor. Mike began to realize that,\r\ntill now, he had never known what boredom meant. There had been moments\r\nin his life which had been less interesting than other moments, but\r\nnothing to touch this for agony. Comrade Prebble's address streamed on\r\nlike water rushing over a weir. Every now and then there was a word or\r\ntwo which was recognizable, but this happened so rarely that it\r\namounted to little. Sometimes Mr Waller would interject a remark, but\r\nnot often. He seemed to be of the opinion that Comrade Prebble's was\r\nthe master mind and that to add anything to his views would be in the\r\nnature of painting the lily and gilding the refined gold. Mike himself\r\nsaid nothing. Psmith and Edward were equally silent. The former sat\r\nlike one in a trance, thinking his own thoughts, while Edward, who,\r\nprospecting on the sideboard, had located a rich biscuit-mine, was too\r\noccupied for speech.\r\n\r\nAfter about twenty minutes, during which Mike's discomfort changed to a\r\ndull resignation, Mr Waller suggested a move to the drawing-room, where\r\nAda, he said, would play some hymns.\r\n\r\nThe prospect did not dazzle Mike, but any change, he thought, must be\r\nfor the better. He had sat staring at the ruin of the blancmange so\r\nlong that it had begun to hypnotize him. Also, the move had the\r\nexcellent result of eliminating the snub-nosed Edward, who was sent to\r\nbed. His last words were in the form of a question, addressed to Mike,\r\non the subject of the hypotenuse and the square upon the same.\r\n\r\n'A remarkably intelligent boy,' said Psmith. 'You must let him come to\r\ntea at our flat one day. I may not be in myself--I have many duties\r\nwhich keep me away--but Comrade Jackson is sure to be there, and will\r\nbe delighted to chat with him.'\r\n\r\nOn the way upstairs Mike tried to get Psmith to himself for a moment to\r\nsuggest the advisability of an early departure; but Psmith was in close\r\nconversation with his host. Mike was left to Comrade Prebble, who,\r\napparently, had only touched the fringe of his subject in his lecture\r\nin the dining-room.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Waller had predicted hymns in the drawing-room, he had been too\r\nsanguine (or too pessimistic). Of Ada, when they arrived, there were no\r\nsigns. It seemed that she had gone straight to bed. Young Mr Richards\r\nwas sitting on the sofa, moodily turning the leaves of a photograph\r\nalbum, which contained portraits of Master Edward Waller in\r\ngeometrically progressing degrees of repulsiveness--here, in frocks,\r\nlooking like a gargoyle; there, in sailor suit, looking like nothing on\r\nearth. The inspection of these was obviously deepening Mr Richards'\r\ngloom, but he proceeded doggedly with it.\r\n\r\nComrade Prebble backed the reluctant Mike into a corner, and, like the\r\nAncient Mariner, held him with a glittering eye. Psmith and Mr Waller,\r\nin the opposite corner, were looking at something with their heads\r\nclose together. Mike definitely abandoned all hope of a rescue from\r\nPsmith, and tried to buoy himself up with the reflection that this\r\ncould not last for ever.\r\n\r\nHours seemed to pass, and then at last he heard Psmith's voice saying\r\ngood-bye to his host.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet. Comrade Prebble was in the middle of a sentence,\r\nbut this was no time for polished courtesy. He felt that he must get\r\naway, and at once. 'I fear,' Psmith was saying, 'that we must tear\r\nourselves away. We have greatly enjoyed our evening. You must look us\r\nup at our flat one day, and bring Comrade Prebble. If I am not in,\r\nComrade Jackson is certain to be, and he will be more than delighted to\r\nhear Comrade Prebble speak further on the subject of which he is such a\r\nmaster.' Comrade Prebble was understood to say that he would certainly\r\ncome. Mr Waller beamed. Mr Richards, still steeped in gloom, shook\r\nhands in silence.\r\n\r\nOut in the road, with the front door shut behind them, Mike spoke his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Smith,' he said definitely, 'if being your confidential\r\nsecretary and adviser is going to let me in for any more of that sort\r\nof thing, you can jolly well accept my resignation.'\r\n\r\n'The orgy was not to your taste?' said Psmith sympathetically.\r\n\r\nMike laughed. One of those short, hollow, bitter laughs.\r\n\r\n'I am at a loss, Comrade Jackson,' said Psmith, 'to understand your\r\nattitude. You fed sumptuously. You had fun with the crockery--that\r\nknockabout act of yours with the water-jug was alone worth the\r\nmoney--and you had the advantage of listening to the views of a\r\nmaster of his subject. What more do you want?'\r\n\r\n'What on earth did you land me with that man Prebble for?'\r\n\r\n'Land you! Why, you courted his society. I had practically to drag you\r\naway from him. When I got up to say good-bye, you were listening to him\r\nwith bulging eyes. I never saw such a picture of rapt attention. Do you\r\nmean to tell me, Comrade Jackson, that your appearance belied you, that\r\nyou were not interested? Well, well. How we misread our fellow\r\ncreatures.'\r\n\r\n'I think you might have come and lent a hand with Prebble. It was a bit\r\nthick.'\r\n\r\n'I was too absorbed with Comrade Waller. We were talking of things of\r\nvital moment. However, the night is yet young. We will take this cab,\r\nwend our way to the West, seek a cafe, and cheer ourselves with light\r\nrefreshments.'\r\n\r\nArrived at a cafe whose window appeared to be a sort of museum of every\r\nkind of German sausage, they took possession of a vacant table and\r\nordered coffee. Mike soon found himself soothed by his bright\r\nsurroundings, and gradually his impressions of blancmange, Edward, and\r\nComrade Prebble faded from his mind. Psmith, meanwhile, was preserving\r\nan unusual silence, being deep in a large square book of the sort in\r\nwhich Press cuttings are pasted. As Psmith scanned its contents a\r\ncurious smile lit up his face. His reflections seemed to be of an\r\nagreeable nature.\r\n\r\n'Hullo,' said Mike, 'what have you got hold of there? Where did you get\r\nthat?'\r\n\r\n'Comrade Waller very kindly lent it to me. He showed it to me after\r\nsupper, knowing how enthusiastically I was attached to the Cause. Had\r\nyou been less tensely wrapped up in Comrade Prebble's conversation, I\r\nwould have desired you to step across and join us. However, you now\r\nhave your opportunity.'\r\n\r\n'But what is it?' asked Mike.\r\n\r\n'It is the record of the meetings of the Tulse Hill Parliament,' said\r\nPsmith impressively. 'A faithful record of all they said, all the votes\r\nof confidence they passed in the Government, and also all the nasty\r\nknocks they gave it from time to time.'\r\n\r\n'What on earth's the Tulse Hill Parliament?'\r\n\r\n'It is, alas,' said Psmith in a grave, sad voice, 'no more. In life it\r\nwas beautiful, but now it has done the Tom Bowling act. It has gone\r\naloft. We are dealing, Comrade Jackson, not with the live, vivid\r\npresent, but with the far-off, rusty past. And yet, in a way, there is\r\na touch of the live, vivid present mixed up in it.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know what the dickens you're talking about,' said Mike. 'Let's\r\nhave a look, anyway.'\r\n\r\nPsmith handed him the volume, and, leaning back, sipped his coffee, and\r\nwatched him. At first Mike's face was bored and blank, but suddenly an\r\ninterested look came into it.\r\n\r\n'Aha!' said Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Who's Bickersdyke? Anything to do with our Bickersdyke?'\r\n\r\n'No other than our genial friend himself.'\r\n\r\nMike turned the pages, reading a line or two on each.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' he said, chuckling. 'He lets himself go a bit, doesn't he!'\r\n\r\n'He does,' acknowledged Psmith. 'A fiery, passionate nature, that of\r\nComrade Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\n'He's simply cursing the Government here. Giving them frightful beans.'\r\n\r\nPsmith nodded.\r\n\r\n'I noticed the fact myself.'\r\n\r\n'But what's it all about?'\r\n\r\n'As far as I can glean from Comrade Waller,' said Psmith, 'about twenty\r\nyears ago, when he and Comrade Bickersdyke worked hand-in-hand as\r\nfellow clerks at the New Asiatic, they were both members of the Tulse\r\nHill Parliament, that powerful institution. At that time Comrade\r\nBickersdyke was as fruity a Socialist as Comrade Waller is now. Only,\r\napparently, as he began to get on a bit in the world, he altered his\r\nviews to some extent as regards the iniquity of freezing on to a decent\r\nshare of the doubloons. And that, you see, is where the dim and rusty\r\npast begins to get mixed up with the live, vivid present. If any\r\ntactless person were to publish those very able speeches made by\r\nComrade Bickersdyke when a bulwark of the Tulse Hill Parliament, our\r\nrevered chief would be more or less caught bending, if I may employ the\r\nexpression, as regards his chances of getting in as Unionist candidate\r\nat Kenningford. You follow me, Watson? I rather fancy the light-hearted\r\nelectors of Kenningford, from what I have seen of their rather acute\r\nsense of humour, would be, as it were, all over it. It would be very,\r\nvery trying for Comrade Bickersdyke if these speeches of his were to\r\nget about.'\r\n\r\n'You aren't going to--!'\r\n\r\n'I shall do nothing rashly. I shall merely place this handsome volume\r\namong my treasured books. I shall add it to my \"Books that have helped\r\nme\" series. Because I fancy that, in an emergency, it may not be at all\r\na bad thing to have about me. And now,' he concluded, 'as the hour is\r\ngetting late, perhaps we had better be shoving off for home.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. The Illness of Edward\r\n\r\n\r\nLife in a bank is at its pleasantest in the winter. When all the world\r\noutside is dark and damp and cold, the light and warmth of the place\r\nare comforting. There is a pleasant air of solidity about the interior\r\nof a bank. The green shaded lamps look cosy. And, the outside world\r\noffering so few attractions, the worker, perched on his stool, feels\r\nthat he is not so badly off after all. It is when the days are long and\r\nthe sun beats hot on the pavement, and everything shouts to him how\r\nsplendid it is out in the country, that he begins to grow restless.\r\n\r\nMike, except for a fortnight at the beginning of his career in the New\r\nAsiatic Bank, had not had to stand the test of sunshine. At present,\r\nthe weather being cold and dismal, he was almost entirely contented.\r\nNow that he had got into the swing of his work, the days passed very\r\nquickly; and with his life after office-hours he had no fault to find\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nHis life was very regular. He would arrive in the morning just in time\r\nto sign his name in the attendance-book before it was removed to the\r\naccountant's room. That was at ten o'clock. From ten to eleven he would\r\npotter. There was nothing going on at that time in his department, and\r\nMr Waller seemed to take it for granted that he should stroll off to\r\nthe Postage Department and talk to Psmith, who had generally some fresh\r\ngrievance against the ring-wearing Bristow to air. From eleven to half\r\npast twelve he would put in a little gentle work. Lunch, unless there\r\nwas a rush of business or Mr Waller happened to suffer from a spasm of\r\nconscientiousness, could be spun out from half past twelve to two. More\r\nwork from two till half past three. From half past three till half past\r\nfour tea in the tearoom, with a novel. And from half past four till\r\nfive either a little more work or more pottering, according to whether\r\nthere was any work to do or not. It was by no means an unpleasant mode\r\nof spending a late January day.\r\n\r\nThen there was no doubt that it was an interesting little community,\r\nthat of the New Asiatic Bank. The curiously amateurish nature of the\r\ninstitution lent a certain air of light-heartedness to the place. It\r\nwas not like one of those banks whose London office is their main\r\noffice, where stern business is everything and a man becomes a mere\r\nmachine for getting through a certain amount of routine work. The\r\nemployees of the New Asiatic Bank, having plenty of time on their\r\nhands, were able to retain their individuality. They had leisure to\r\nthink of other things besides their work. Indeed, they had so much\r\nleisure that it is a wonder they thought of their work at all.\r\n\r\nThe place was full of quaint characters. There was West, who had been\r\nrequested to leave Haileybury owing to his habit of borrowing horses\r\nand attending meets in the neighbourhood, the same being always out of\r\nbounds and necessitating a complete disregard of the rules respecting\r\nevening chapel and lock-up. He was a small, dried-up youth, with black\r\nhair plastered down on his head. He went about his duties in a costume\r\nwhich suggested the sportsman of the comic papers.\r\n\r\nThere was also Hignett, who added to the meagre salary allowed him by\r\nthe bank by singing comic songs at the minor music halls. He confided\r\nto Mike his intention of leaving the bank as soon as he had made a\r\nname, and taking seriously to the business. He told him that he had\r\nknocked them at the Bedford the week before, and in support of the\r\nstatement showed him a cutting from the Era, in which the writer said\r\nthat 'Other acceptable turns were the Bounding Zouaves, Steingruber's\r\nDogs, and Arthur Hignett.' Mike wished him luck.\r\n\r\nAnd there was Raymond who dabbled in journalism and was the author of\r\n'Straight Talks to Housewives' in _Trifles_, under the pseudonym\r\nof 'Lady Gussie'; Wragge, who believed that the earth was flat, and\r\naddressed meetings on the subject in Hyde Park on Sundays; and many\r\nothers, all interesting to talk to of a morning when work was slack and\r\ntime had to be filled in.\r\n\r\nMike found himself, by degrees, growing quite attached to the New\r\nAsiatic Bank.\r\n\r\nOne morning, early in February, he noticed a curious change in Mr\r\nWaller. The head of the Cash Department was, as a rule, mildly cheerful\r\non arrival, and apt (excessively, Mike thought, though he always\r\nlistened with polite interest) to relate the most recent sayings and\r\ndoings of his snub-nosed son, Edward. No action of this young prodigy\r\nwas withheld from Mike. He had heard, on different occasions, how he\r\nhad won a prize at his school for General Information (which Mike could\r\nwell believe); how he had trapped young Mr Richards, now happily\r\nreconciled to Ada, with an ingenious verbal catch; and how he had made\r\na sequence of diverting puns on the name of the new curate, during the\r\ncourse of that cleric's first Sunday afternoon visit.\r\n\r\nOn this particular day, however, the cashier was silent and\r\nabsent-minded. He answered Mike's good-morning mechanically, and\r\nsitting down at his desk, stared blankly across the building. There\r\nwas a curiously grey, tired look on his face.\r\n\r\nMike could not make it out. He did not like to ask if there was\r\nanything the matter. Mr Waller's face had the unreasonable effect on\r\nhim of making him feel shy and awkward. Anything in the nature of\r\nsorrow always dried Mike up and robbed him of the power of speech.\r\nBeing naturally sympathetic, he had raged inwardly in many a crisis at\r\nthis devil of dumb awkwardness which possessed him and prevented him\r\nfrom putting his sympathy into words. He had always envied the cooing\r\nreadiness of the hero on the stage when anyone was in trouble. He\r\nwondered whether he would ever acquire that knack of pouring out a\r\nlimpid stream of soothing words on such occasions. At present he could\r\nget no farther than a scowl and an almost offensive gruffness.\r\n\r\nThe happy thought struck him of consulting Psmith. It was his hour for\r\npottering, so he pottered round to the Postage Department, where he\r\nfound the old Etonian eyeing with disfavour a new satin tie which\r\nBristow was wearing that morning for the first time.\r\n\r\n'I say, Smith,' he said, 'I want to speak to you for a second.'\r\n\r\nPsmith rose. Mike led the way to a quiet corner of the Telegrams\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n'I tell you, Comrade Jackson,' said Psmith, 'I am hard pressed. The\r\nfight is beginning to be too much for me. After a grim struggle, after\r\ndays of unremitting toil, I succeeded yesterday in inducing the man\r\nBristow to abandon that rainbow waistcoat of his. Today I enter the\r\nbuilding, blythe and buoyant, worn, of course, from the long struggle,\r\nbut seeing with aching eyes the dawn of another, better era, and there\r\nis Comrade Bristow in a satin tie. It's hard, Comrade Jackson, it's\r\nhard, I tell you.'\r\n\r\n'Look here, Smith,' said Mike, 'I wish you'd go round to the Cash and\r\nfind out what's up with old Waller. He's got the hump about something.\r\nHe's sitting there looking absolutely fed up with things. I hope\r\nthere's nothing up. He's not a bad sort. It would be rot if anything\r\nrotten's happened.'\r\n\r\nPsmith began to display a gentle interest.\r\n\r\n'So other people have troubles as well as myself,' he murmured\r\nmusingly. 'I had almost forgotten that. Comrade Waller's misfortunes\r\ncannot but be trivial compared with mine, but possibly it will be as\r\nwell to ascertain their nature. I will reel round and make inquiries.'\r\n\r\n'Good man,' said Mike. 'I'll wait here.'\r\n\r\nPsmith departed, and returned, ten minutes later, looking more serious\r\nthan when he had left.\r\n\r\n'His kid's ill, poor chap,' he said briefly. 'Pretty badly too, from\r\nwhat I can gather. Pneumonia. Waller was up all night. He oughtn't to\r\nbe here at all today. He doesn't know what he's doing half the time.\r\nHe's absolutely fagged out. Look here, you'd better nip back and do as\r\nmuch of the work as you can. I shouldn't talk to him much if I were\r\nyou. Buck along.'\r\n\r\nMike went. Mr Waller was still sitting staring out across the aisle.\r\nThere was something more than a little gruesome in the sight of him. He\r\nwore a crushed, beaten look, as if all the life and fight had gone out\r\nof him. A customer came to the desk to cash a cheque. The cashier\r\nshovelled the money to him under the bars with the air of one whose\r\nmind is elsewhere. Mike could guess what he was feeling, and what he\r\nwas thinking about. The fact that the snub-nosed Edward was, without\r\nexception, the most repulsive small boy he had ever met in this world,\r\nwhere repulsive small boys crowd and jostle one another, did not\r\ninterfere with his appreciation of the cashier's state of mind. Mike's\r\nwas essentially a sympathetic character. He had the gift of intuitive\r\nunderstanding, where people of whom he was fond were concerned. It was\r\nthis which drew to him those who had intelligence enough to see beyond\r\nhis sometimes rather forbidding manner, and to realize that his blunt\r\nspeech was largely due to shyness. In spite of his prejudice against\r\nEdward, he could put himself into Mr Waller's place, and see the thing\r\nfrom his point of view.\r\n\r\nPsmith's injunction to him not to talk much was unnecessary. Mike, as\r\nalways, was rendered utterly dumb by the sight of suffering. He sat at\r\nhis desk, occupying himself as best he could with the driblets of work\r\nwhich came to him.\r\n\r\nMr Waller's silence and absentness continued unchanged. The habit of\r\nyears had made his work mechanical. Probably few of the customers who\r\ncame to cash cheques suspected that there was anything the matter with\r\nthe man who paid them their money. After all, most people look on the\r\ncashier of a bank as a sort of human slot-machine. You put in your\r\ncheque, and out comes money. It is no affair of yours whether life is\r\ntreating the machine well or ill that day.\r\n\r\nThe hours dragged slowly by till five o'clock struck, and the cashier,\r\nputting on his coat and hat, passed silently out through the swing\r\ndoors. He walked listlessly. He was evidently tired out.\r\n\r\nMike shut his ledger with a vicious bang, and went across to find\r\nPsmith. He was glad the day was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. Concerning a Cheque\r\n\r\n\r\nThings never happen quite as one expects them to. Mike came to the\r\noffice next morning prepared for a repetition of the previous day. He\r\nwas amazed to find the cashier not merely cheerful, but even\r\nexuberantly cheerful. Edward, it appeared, had rallied in the\r\nafternoon, and, when his father had got home, had been out of danger.\r\nHe was now going along excellently, and had stumped Ada, who was\r\nnursing him, with a question about the Thirty Years' War, only a few\r\nminutes before his father had left to catch his train. The cashier was\r\noverflowing with happiness and goodwill towards his species. He greeted\r\ncustomers with bright remarks on the weather, and snappy views on the\r\nleading events of the day: the former tinged with optimism, the latter\r\nfull of a gentle spirit of toleration. His attitude towards the latest\r\nactions of His Majesty's Government was that of one who felt that,\r\nafter all, there was probably some good even in the vilest of his\r\nfellow creatures, if one could only find it.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the cloud had lifted from the Cash Department. All was joy,\r\njollity, and song.\r\n\r\n'The attitude of Comrade Waller,' said Psmith, on being informed of the\r\nchange, 'is reassuring. I may now think of my own troubles. Comrade\r\nBristow has blown into the office today in patent leather boots with\r\nwhite kid uppers, as I believe the technical term is. Add to that the\r\nfact that he is still wearing the satin tie, the waistcoat, and the\r\nring, and you will understand why I have definitely decided this\r\nmorning to abandon all hope of his reform. Henceforth my services, for\r\nwhat they are worth, are at the disposal of Comrade Bickersdyke. My\r\ntime from now onward is his. He shall have the full educative value of\r\nmy exclusive attention. I give Comrade Bristow up. Made straight for\r\nthe corner flag, you understand,' he added, as Mr Rossiter emerged from\r\nhis lair, 'and centred, and Sandy Turnbull headed a beautiful goal. I\r\nwas just telling Jackson about the match against Blackburn Rovers,' he\r\nsaid to Mr Rossiter.\r\n\r\n'Just so, just so. But get on with your work, Smith. We are a little\r\nbehind-hand. I think perhaps it would be as well not to leave it just\r\nyet.'\r\n\r\n'I will leap at it at once,' said Psmith cordially.\r\n\r\nMike went back to his department.\r\n\r\nThe day passed quickly. Mr Waller, in the intervals of work, talked a\r\ngood deal, mostly of Edward, his doings, his sayings, and his\r\nprospects. The only thing that seemed to worry Mr Waller was the\r\nproblem of how to employ his son's almost superhuman talents to the\r\nbest advantage. Most of the goals towards which the average man strives\r\nstruck him as too unambitious for the prodigy.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the day Mike had had enough of Edward. He never wished to\r\nhear the name again.\r\n\r\nWe do not claim originality for the statement that things never happen\r\nquite as one expects them to. We repeat it now because of its profound\r\ntruth. The Edward's pneumonia episode having ended satisfactorily (or,\r\nrather, being apparently certain to end satisfactorily, for the\r\ninvalid, though out of danger, was still in bed), Mike looked forward\r\nto a series of days unbroken by any but the minor troubles of life. For\r\nthese he was prepared. What he did not expect was any big calamity.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the day there were no signs of it. The sky was blue\r\nand free from all suggestions of approaching thunderbolts. Mr Waller,\r\nstill chirpy, had nothing but good news of Edward. Mike went for his\r\nmorning stroll round the office feeling that things had settled down\r\nand had made up their mind to run smoothly.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back, barely half an hour later, the storm had burst.\r\n\r\nThere was no one in the department at the moment of his arrival; but a\r\nfew minutes later he saw Mr Waller come out of the manager's room, and\r\nmake his way down the aisle.\r\n\r\nIt was his walk which first gave any hint that something was wrong. It\r\nwas the same limp, crushed walk which Mike had seen when Edward's\r\nsafety still hung in the balance.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Waller came nearer, Mike saw that the cashier's face was deadly\r\npale.\r\n\r\nMr Waller caught sight of him and quickened his pace.\r\n\r\n'Jackson,' he said.\r\n\r\nMike came forward.\r\n\r\n'Do you--remember--' he spoke slowly, and with an effort, 'do you\r\nremember a cheque coming through the day before yesterday for a hundred\r\npounds, with Sir John Morrison's signature?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. It came in the morning, rather late.'\r\n\r\nMike remembered the cheque perfectly well, owing to the amount. It was\r\nthe only three-figure cheque which had come across the counter during\r\nthe day. It had been presented just before the cashier had gone out to\r\nlunch. He recollected the man who had presented it, a tallish man with\r\na beard. He had noticed him particularly because of the contrast\r\nbetween his manner and that of the cashier. The former had been so very\r\ncheery and breezy, the latter so dazed and silent.\r\n\r\n'Why,' he said.\r\n\r\n'It was a forgery,' muttered Mr Waller, sitting down heavily.\r\n\r\nMike could not take it in all at once. He was stunned. All he could\r\nunderstand was that a far worse thing had happened than anything he\r\ncould have imagined.\r\n\r\n'A forgery?' he said.\r\n\r\n'A forgery. And a clumsy one. Oh it's hard. I should have seen it on\r\nany other day but that. I could not have missed it. They showed me the\r\ncheque in there just now. I could not believe that I had passed it. I\r\ndon't remember doing it. My mind was far away. I don't remember the\r\ncheque or anything about it. Yet there it is.'\r\n\r\nOnce more Mike was tongue-tied. For the life of him he could not think\r\nof anything to say. Surely, he thought, he could find _something_\r\nin the shape of words to show his sympathy. But he could find nothing\r\nthat would not sound horribly stilted and cold. He sat silent.\r\n\r\n'Sir John is in there,' went on the cashier. 'He is furious. Mr\r\nBickersdyke, too. They are both furious. I shall be dismissed. I shall\r\nlose my place. I shall be dismissed.' He was talking more to himself\r\nthan to Mike. It was dreadful to see him sitting there, all limp and\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n'I shall lose my place. Mr Bickersdyke has wanted to get rid of me for\r\na long time. He never liked me. I shall be dismissed. What can I do?\r\nI'm an old man. I can't make another start. I am good for nothing.\r\nNobody will take an old man like me.'\r\n\r\nHis voice died away. There was a silence. Mike sat staring miserably in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nThen, quite suddenly, an idea came to him. The whole pressure of the\r\natmosphere seemed to lift. He saw a way out. It was a curious crooked\r\nway, but at that moment it stretched clear and broad before him. He\r\nfelt lighthearted and excited, as if he were watching the development\r\nof some interesting play at the theatre.\r\n\r\nHe got up, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe cashier did not notice the movement. Somebody had come in to cash a\r\ncheque, and he was working mechanically.\r\n\r\nMike walked up the aisle to Mr Bickersdyke's room, and went in.\r\n\r\nThe manager was in his chair at the big table. Opposite him, facing\r\nslightly sideways, was a small, round, very red-faced man. Mr\r\nBickersdyke was speaking as Mike entered.\r\n\r\n'I can assure you, Sir John--' he was saying.\r\n\r\nHe looked up as the door opened.\r\n\r\n'Well, Mr Jackson?'\r\n\r\nMike almost laughed. The situation was tickling him.\r\n\r\n'Mr Waller has told me--' he began.\r\n\r\n'I have already seen Mr Waller.'\r\n\r\n'I know. He told me about the cheque. I came to explain.'\r\n\r\n'Explain?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. He didn't cash it at all.'\r\n\r\n'I don't understand you, Mr Jackson.'\r\n\r\n'I was at the counter when it was brought in,' said Mike. 'I cashed it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. Psmith Makes Inquiries\r\n\r\n\r\nPsmith, as was his habit of a morning when the fierce rush of his\r\ncommercial duties had abated somewhat, was leaning gracefully against\r\nhis desk, musing on many things, when he was aware that Bristow was\r\nstanding before him.\r\n\r\nFocusing his attention with some reluctance upon this blot on the\r\nhorizon, he discovered that the exploiter of rainbow waistcoats and\r\nsatin ties was addressing him.\r\n\r\n'I say, Smithy,' said Bristow. He spoke in rather an awed voice.\r\n\r\n'Say on, Comrade Bristow,' said Psmith graciously. 'You have our ear.\r\nYou would seem to have something on your chest in addition to that\r\nNeapolitan ice garment which, I regret to see, you still flaunt. If it\r\nis one tithe as painful as that, you have my sympathy. Jerk it out,\r\nComrade Bristow.'\r\n\r\n'Jackson isn't half copping it from old Bick.'\r\n\r\n'Isn't--? What exactly did you say?'\r\n\r\n'He's getting it hot on the carpet.'\r\n\r\n'You wish to indicate,' said Psmith, 'that there is some slight\r\ndisturbance, some passing breeze between Comrades Jackson and\r\nBickersdyke?'\r\n\r\nBristow chuckled.\r\n\r\n'Breeze! Blooming hurricane, more like it. I was in Bick's room just\r\nnow with a letter to sign, and I tell you, the fur was flying all over\r\nthe bally shop. There was old Bick cursing for all he was worth, and a\r\nlittle red-faced buffer puffing out his cheeks in an armchair.'\r\n\r\n'We all have our hobbies,' said Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Jackson wasn't saying much. He jolly well hadn't a chance. Old Bick\r\nwas shooting it out fourteen to the dozen.'\r\n\r\n'I have been privileged,' said Psmith, 'to hear Comrade Bickersdyke\r\nspeak both in his sanctum and in public. He has, as you suggest, a\r\nready flow of speech. What, exactly was the cause of the turmoil?'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't wait to hear. I was too jolly glad to get away. Old Bick\r\nlooked at me as if he could eat me, snatched the letter out of my hand,\r\nsigned it, and waved his hand at the door as a hint to hop it. Which I\r\njolly well did. He had started jawing Jackson again before I was out of\r\nthe room.'\r\n\r\n'While applauding his hustle,' said Psmith, 'I fear that I must take\r\nofficial notice of this. Comrade Jackson is essentially a Sensitive\r\nPlant, highly strung, neurotic. I cannot have his nervous system jolted\r\nand disorganized in this manner, and his value as a confidential\r\nsecretary and adviser impaired, even though it be only temporarily. I\r\nmust look into this. I will go and see if the orgy is concluded. I will\r\nhear what Comrade Jackson has to say on the matter. I shall not act\r\nrashly, Comrade Bristow. If the man Bickersdyke is proved to have had\r\ngood grounds for his outbreak, he shall escape uncensured. I may even\r\nlook in on him and throw him a word of praise. But if I find, as I\r\nsuspect, that he has wronged Comrade Jackson, I shall be forced to\r\nspeak sharply to him.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMike had left the scene of battle by the time Psmith reached the Cash\r\nDepartment, and was sitting at his desk in a somewhat dazed condition,\r\ntrying to clear his mind sufficiently to enable him to see exactly how\r\nmatters stood as concerned himself. He felt confused and rattled. He\r\nhad known, when he went to the manager's room to make his statement,\r\nthat there would be trouble. But, then, trouble is such an elastic\r\nword. It embraces a hundred degrees of meaning. Mike had expected\r\nsentence of dismissal, and he had got it. So far he had nothing to\r\ncomplain of. But he had not expected it to come to him riding high on\r\nthe crest of a great, frothing wave of verbal denunciation. Mr\r\nBickersdyke, through constantly speaking in public, had developed the\r\nhabit of fluent denunciation to a remarkable extent. He had thundered\r\nat Mike as if Mike had been his Majesty's Government or the Encroaching\r\nAlien, or something of that sort. And that kind of thing is a little\r\noverwhelming at short range. Mike's head was still spinning.\r\n\r\nIt continued to spin; but he never lost sight of the fact round which\r\nit revolved, namely, that he had been dismissed from the service of the\r\nbank. And for the first time he began to wonder what they would say\r\nabout this at home.\r\n\r\nUp till now the matter had seemed entirely a personal one. He had\r\ncharged in to rescue the harassed cashier in precisely the same way as\r\nthat in which he had dashed in to save him from Bill, the Stone-Flinging\r\nScourge of Clapham Common. Mike's was one of those direct, honest minds\r\nwhich are apt to concentrate themselves on the crisis of the moment,\r\nand to leave the consequences out of the question entirely.\r\n\r\nWhat would they say at home? That was the point.\r\n\r\nAgain, what could he do by way of earning a living? He did not know\r\nmuch about the City and its ways, but he knew enough to understand that\r\nsummary dismissal from a bank is not the best recommendation one can\r\nput forward in applying for another job. And if he did not get another\r\njob in the City, what could he do? If it were only summer, he might get\r\ntaken on somewhere as a cricket professional. Cricket was his line. He\r\ncould earn his pay at that. But it was very far from being summer.\r\n\r\nHe had turned the problem over in his mind till his head ached, and had\r\neaten in the process one-third of a wooden penholder, when Psmith\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n'It has reached me,' said Psmith, 'that you and Comrade Bickersdyke\r\nhave been seen doing the Hackenschmidt-Gotch act on the floor. When my\r\ninformant left, he tells me, Comrade B. had got a half-Nelson on you,\r\nand was biting pieces out of your ear. Is this so?'\r\n\r\nMike got up. Psmith was the man, he felt, to advise him in this crisis.\r\nPsmith's was the mind to grapple with his Hard Case.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Smith,' he said, 'I want to speak to you. I'm in a bit of a\r\nhole, and perhaps you can tell me what to do. Let's go out and have a\r\ncup of coffee, shall we? I can't tell you about it here.'\r\n\r\n'An admirable suggestion,' said Psmith. 'Things in the Postage\r\nDepartment are tolerably quiescent at present. Naturally I shall be\r\nmissed, if I go out. But my absence will not spell irretrievable ruin,\r\nas it would at a period of greater commercial activity. Comrades\r\nRossiter and Bristow have studied my methods. They know how I like\r\nthings to be done. They are fully competent to conduct the business of\r\nthe department in my absence. Let us, as you say, scud forth. We will\r\ngo to a Mecca. Why so-called I do not know, nor, indeed, do I ever hope\r\nto know. There we may obtain, at a price, a passable cup of coffee, and\r\nyou shall tell me your painful story.'\r\n\r\nThe Mecca, except for the curious aroma which pervades all Meccas, was\r\ndeserted. Psmith, moving a box of dominoes on to the next table, sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n'Dominoes,' he said, 'is one of the few manly sports which have never\r\nhad great attractions for me. A cousin of mine, who secured his chess\r\nblue at Oxford, would, they tell me, have represented his University in\r\nthe dominoes match also, had he not unfortunately dislocated the radius\r\nbone of his bazooka while training for it. Except for him, there has\r\nbeen little dominoes talent in the Psmith family. Let us merely talk.\r\nWhat of this slight brass-rag-parting to which I alluded just now? Tell\r\nme all.'\r\n\r\nHe listened gravely while Mike related the incidents which had led up\r\nto his confession and the results of the same. At the conclusion of the\r\nnarrative he sipped his coffee in silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n'This habit of taking on to your shoulders the harvest of other\r\npeople's bloomers,' he said meditatively, 'is growing upon you, Comrade\r\nJackson. You must check it. It is like dram-drinking. You begin in a\r\nsmall way by breaking school rules to extract Comrade Jellicoe (perhaps\r\nthe supremest of all the blitherers I have ever met) from a hole. If\r\nyou had stopped there, all might have been well. But the thing, once\r\nstarted, fascinated you. Now you have landed yourself with a splash in\r\nthe very centre of the Oxo in order to do a good turn to Comrade\r\nWaller. You must drop it, Comrade Jackson. When you were free and\r\nwithout ties, it did not so much matter. But now that you are\r\nconfidential secretary and adviser to a Shropshire Psmith, the thing\r\nmust stop. Your secretarial duties must be paramount. Nothing must be\r\nallowed to interfere with them. Yes. The thing must stop before it goes\r\ntoo far.'\r\n\r\n'It seems to me,' said Mike, 'that it has gone too far. I've got the\r\nsack. I don't know how much farther you want it to go.'\r\n\r\nPsmith stirred his coffee before replying.\r\n\r\n'True,' he said, 'things look perhaps a shade rocky just now, but all\r\nis not yet lost. You must recollect that Comrade Bickersdyke spoke in\r\nthe heat of the moment. That generous temperament was stirred to its\r\ndepths. He did not pick his words. But calm will succeed storm, and we\r\nmay be able to do something yet. I have some little influence with\r\nComrade Bickersdyke. Wrongly, perhaps,' added Psmith modestly, 'he\r\nthinks somewhat highly of my judgement. If he sees that I am opposed to\r\nthis step, he may possibly reconsider it. What Psmith thinks today, is\r\nhis motto, I shall think tomorrow. However, we shall see.'\r\n\r\n'I bet we shall!' said Mike ruefully.\r\n\r\n'There is, moreover,' continued Psmith, 'another aspect to the affair.\r\nWhen you were being put through it, in Comrade Bickersdyke's inimitably\r\nbreezy manner, Sir John What's-his-name was, I am given to understand,\r\npresent. Naturally, to pacify the aggrieved bart., Comrade B. had to\r\nlay it on regardless of expense. In America, as possibly you are aware,\r\nthere is a regular post of mistake-clerk, whose duty it is to receive\r\nin the neck anything that happens to be coming along when customers\r\nmake complaints. He is hauled into the presence of the foaming\r\ncustomer, cursed, and sacked. The customer goes away appeased. The\r\nmistake-clerk, if the harangue has been unusually energetic, applies\r\nfor a rise of salary. Now, possibly, in your case--'\r\n\r\n'In my case,' interrupted Mike, 'there was none of that rot.\r\nBickersdyke wasn't putting it on. He meant every word. Why, dash it\r\nall, you know yourself he'd be only too glad to sack me, just to get\r\nsome of his own back with me.'\r\n\r\nPsmith's eyes opened in pained surprise.\r\n\r\n'Get some of his own back!' he repeated.\r\n\r\n'Are you insinuating, Comrade Jackson, that my relations with Comrade\r\nBickersdyke are not of the most pleasant and agreeable nature possible?\r\nHow do these ideas get about? I yield to nobody in my respect for our\r\nmanager. I may have had occasion from time to time to correct him in\r\nsome trifling matter, but surely he is not the man to let such a thing\r\nrankle? No! I prefer to think that Comrade Bickersdyke regards me as\r\nhis friend and well-wisher, and will lend a courteous ear to any\r\nproposal I see fit to make. I hope shortly to be able to prove this to\r\nyou. I will discuss this little affair of the cheque with him at our\r\nease at the club, and I shall be surprised if we do not come to some\r\narrangement.'\r\n\r\n'Look here, Smith,' said Mike earnestly, 'for goodness' sake don't go\r\nplaying the goat. There's no earthly need for you to get lugged into\r\nthis business. Don't you worry about me. I shall be all right.'\r\n\r\n'I think,' said Psmith, 'that you will--when I have chatted with\r\nComrade Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. And Take Steps\r\n\r\n\r\nOn returning to the bank, Mike found Mr Waller in the grip of a\r\npeculiarly varied set of mixed feelings. Shortly after Mike's departure\r\nfor the Mecca, the cashier had been summoned once more into the\r\nPresence, and had there been informed that, as apparently he had not\r\nbeen directly responsible for the gross piece of carelessness by which\r\nthe bank had suffered so considerable a loss (here Sir John puffed out\r\nhis cheeks like a meditative toad), the matter, as far as he was\r\nconcerned, was at an end. On the other hand--! Here Mr Waller was\r\nhauled over the coals for Incredible Rashness in allowing a mere junior\r\nsubordinate to handle important tasks like the paying out of money, and\r\nso on, till he felt raw all over. However, it was not dismissal. That\r\nwas the great thing. And his principal sensation was one of relief.\r\n\r\nMingled with the relief were sympathy for Mike, gratitude to him for\r\nhaving given himself up so promptly, and a curiously dazed sensation,\r\nas if somebody had been hitting him on the head with a bolster.\r\n\r\nAll of which emotions, taken simultaneously, had the effect of\r\nrendering him completely dumb when he saw Mike. He felt that he did not\r\nknow what to say to him. And as Mike, for his part, simply wanted to be\r\nlet alone, and not compelled to talk, conversation was at something of\r\na standstill in the Cash Department.\r\n\r\nAfter five minutes, it occurred to Mr Waller that perhaps the best plan\r\nwould be to interview Psmith. Psmith would know exactly how matters\r\nstood. He could not ask Mike point-blank whether he had been dismissed.\r\nBut there was the probability that Psmith had been informed and would\r\npass on the information.\r\n\r\nPsmith received the cashier with a dignified kindliness.\r\n\r\n'Oh, er, Smith,' said Mr Waller, 'I wanted just to ask you about\r\nJackson.'\r\n\r\nPsmith bowed his head gravely.\r\n\r\n'Exactly,' he said. 'Comrade Jackson. I think I may say that you have\r\ncome to the right man. Comrade Jackson has placed himself in my hands,\r\nand I am dealing with his case. A somewhat tricky business, but I shall\r\nsee him through.'\r\n\r\n'Has he--?' Mr Waller hesitated.\r\n\r\n'You were saying?' said Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Does Mr Bickersdyke intend to dismiss him?'\r\n\r\n'At present,' admitted Psmith, 'there is some idea of that description\r\nfloating--nebulously, as it were--in Comrade Bickersdyke's mind.\r\nIndeed, from what I gather from my client, the push was actually\r\nadministered, in so many words. But tush! And possibly bah! we know\r\nwhat happens on these occasions, do we not? You and I are students of\r\nhuman nature, and we know that a man of Comrade Bickersdyke's\r\nwarm-hearted type is apt to say in the heat of the moment a great deal\r\nmore than he really means. Men of his impulsive character cannot help\r\nexpressing themselves in times of stress with a certain generous\r\nstrength which those who do not understand them are inclined to take a\r\nlittle too seriously. I shall have a chat with Comrade Bickersdyke at\r\nthe conclusion of the day's work, and I have no doubt that we shall\r\nboth laugh heartily over this little episode.'\r\n\r\nMr Waller pulled at his beard, with an expression on his face that\r\nseemed to suggest that he was not quite so confident on this point. He\r\nwas about to put his doubts into words when Mr Rossiter appeared, and\r\nPsmith, murmuring something about duty, turned again to his ledger. The\r\ncashier drifted back to his own department.\r\n\r\nIt was one of Psmith's theories of Life, which he was accustomed to\r\npropound to Mike in the small hours of the morning with his feet on the\r\nmantelpiece, that the secret of success lay in taking advantage of\r\none's occasional slices of luck, in seizing, as it were, the happy\r\nmoment. When Mike, who had had the passage to write out ten times at\r\nWrykyn on one occasion as an imposition, reminded him that Shakespeare\r\nhad once said something about there being a tide in the affairs of men,\r\nwhich, taken at the flood, &c., Psmith had acknowledged with an easy\r\ngrace that possibly Shakespeare _had_ got on to it first, and that\r\nit was but one more proof of how often great minds thought alike.\r\n\r\nThough waiving his claim to the copyright of the maxim, he nevertheless\r\nhad a high opinion of it, and frequently acted upon it in the conduct\r\nof his own life.\r\n\r\nThus, when approaching the Senior Conservative Club at five o'clock\r\nwith the idea of finding Mr Bickersdyke there, he observed his quarry\r\nentering the Turkish Baths which stand some twenty yards from the\r\nclub's front door, he acted on his maxim, and decided, instead of\r\nwaiting for the manager to finish his bath before approaching him on\r\nthe subject of Mike, to corner him in the Baths themselves.\r\n\r\nHe gave Mr Bickersdyke five minutes' start. Then, reckoning that by\r\nthat time he would probably have settled down, he pushed open the door\r\nand went in himself. And, having paid his money, and left his boots\r\nwith the boy at the threshold, he was rewarded by the sight of the\r\nmanager emerging from a box at the far end of the room, clad in the\r\nmottled towels which the bather, irrespective of his personal taste in\r\ndress, is obliged to wear in a Turkish bath.\r\n\r\nPsmith made for the same box. Mr Bickersdyke's clothes lay at the head\r\nof one of the sofas, but nobody else had staked out a claim. Psmith\r\ntook possession of the sofa next to the manager's. Then, humming\r\nlightly, he undressed, and made his way downstairs to the Hot Rooms. He\r\nrather fancied himself in towels. There was something about them which\r\nseemed to suit his figure. They gave him, he though, rather a\r\n_debonnaire_ look. He paused for a moment before the looking-glass\r\nto examine himself, with approval, then pushed open the door of the Hot\r\nRooms and went in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23. Mr Bickersdyke Makes a Concession\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke was reclining in an easy-chair in the first room,\r\nstaring before him in the boiled-fish manner customary in a Turkish\r\nBath. Psmith dropped into the next seat with a cheery 'Good evening.'\r\nThe manager started as if some firm hand had driven a bradawl into him.\r\nHe looked at Psmith with what was intended to be a dignified stare. But\r\ndignity is hard to achieve in a couple of parti-coloured towels. The\r\nstare did not differ to any great extent from the conventional\r\nboiled-fish look, alluded to above.\r\n\r\nPsmith settled himself comfortably in his chair. 'Fancy finding you\r\nhere,' he said pleasantly. 'We seem always to be meeting. To me,' he\r\nadded, with a reassuring smile, 'it is a great pleasure. A very great\r\npleasure indeed. We see too little of each other during office hours.\r\nNot that one must grumble at that. Work before everything. You have\r\nyour duties, I mine. It is merely unfortunate that those duties are not\r\nsuch as to enable us to toil side by side, encouraging each other with\r\nword and gesture. However, it is idle to repine. We must make the most\r\nof these chance meetings when the work of the day is over.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke heaved himself up from his chair and took another at the\r\nopposite end of the room. Psmith joined him.\r\n\r\n'There's something pleasantly mysterious, to my mind,' said he\r\nchattily, 'in a Turkish Bath. It seems to take one out of the hurry and\r\nbustle of the everyday world. It is a quiet backwater in the rushing\r\nriver of Life. I like to sit and think in a Turkish Bath. Except, of\r\ncourse, when I have a congenial companion to talk to. As now. To me--'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke rose, and went into the next room.\r\n\r\n'To me,' continued Psmith, again following, and seating himself beside\r\nthe manager, 'there is, too, something eerie in these places. There is\r\na certain sinister air about the attendants. They glide rather than\r\nwalk. They say little. Who knows what they may be planning and\r\nplotting? That drip-drip again. It may be merely water, but how are we\r\nto know that it is not blood? It would be so easy to do away with a man\r\nin a Turkish Bath. Nobody has seen him come in. Nobody can trace him if\r\nhe disappears. These are uncomfortable thoughts, Mr Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke seemed to think them so. He rose again, and returned to\r\nthe first room.\r\n\r\n'I have made you restless,' said Psmith, in a voice of self-reproach,\r\nwhen he had settled himself once more by the manager's side. 'I am\r\nsorry. I will not pursue the subject. Indeed, I believe that my fears\r\nare unnecessary. Statistics show, I understand, that large numbers of\r\nmen emerge in safety every year from Turkish Baths. There was another\r\nmatter of which I wished to speak to you. It is a somewhat delicate\r\nmatter, and I am only encouraged to mention it to you by the fact that\r\nyou are so close a friend of my father's.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke had picked up an early edition of an evening paper, left\r\non the table at his side by a previous bather, and was to all\r\nappearances engrossed in it. Psmith, however, not discouraged,\r\nproceeded to touch upon the matter of Mike.\r\n\r\n'There was,' he said, 'some little friction, I hear, in the office\r\ntoday in connection with a cheque.' The evening paper hid the manager's\r\nexpressive face, but from the fact that the hands holding it tightened\r\ntheir grip Psmith deduced that Mr Bickersdyke's attention was not\r\nwholly concentrated on the City news. Moreover, his toes wriggled. And\r\nwhen a man's toes wriggle, he is interested in what you are saying.\r\n\r\n'All these petty breezes,' continued Psmith sympathetically, 'must be\r\nvery trying to a man in your position, a man who wishes to be left\r\nalone in order to devote his entire thought to the niceties of the\r\nhigher Finance. It is as if Napoleon, while planning out some intricate\r\nscheme of campaign, were to be called upon in the midst of his\r\nmeditations to bully a private for not cleaning his buttons. Naturally,\r\nyou were annoyed. Your giant brain, wrenched temporarily from its\r\nproper groove, expended its force in one tremendous reprimand of\r\nComrade Jackson. It was as if one had diverted some terrific electric\r\ncurrent which should have been controlling a vast system of machinery,\r\nand turned it on to annihilate a black-beetle. In the present case, of\r\ncourse, the result is as might have been expected. Comrade Jackson, not\r\nrealizing the position of affairs, went away with the absurd idea that\r\nall was over, that you meant all you said--briefly, that his number was\r\nup. I assured him that he was mistaken, but no! He persisted in\r\ndeclaring that all was over, that you had dismissed him from the bank.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke lowered the paper and glared bulbously at the old\r\nEtonian.\r\n\r\n'Mr Jackson is perfectly right,' he snapped. 'Of course I dismissed\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes,' said Psmith, 'I have no doubt that at the moment you did\r\nwork the rapid push. What I am endeavouring to point out is that\r\nComrade Jackson is under the impression that the edict is permanent,\r\nthat he can hope for no reprieve.'\r\n\r\n'Nor can he.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean--'\r\n\r\n'I mean what I say.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, I quite understand,' said Psmith, as one who sees that he must\r\nmake allowances. 'The incident is too recent. The storm has not yet had\r\ntime to expend itself. You have not had leisure to think the matter\r\nover coolly. It is hard, of course, to be cool in a Turkish Bath. Your\r\nganglions are still vibrating. Later, perhaps--'\r\n\r\n'Once and for all,' growled Mr Bickersdyke, 'the thing is ended. Mr\r\nJackson will leave the bank at the end of the month. We have no room\r\nfor fools in the office.'\r\n\r\n'You surprise me,' said Psmith. 'I should not have thought that the\r\nstandard of intelligence in the bank was extremely high. With the\r\nexception of our two selves, I think that there are hardly any men of\r\nreal intelligence on the staff. And comrade Jackson is improving every\r\nday. Being, as he is, under my constant supervision he is rapidly\r\ndeveloping a stranglehold on his duties, which--'\r\n\r\n'I have no wish to discuss the matter any further.'\r\n\r\n'No, no. Quite so, quite so. Not another word. I am dumb.'\r\n\r\n'There are limits you see, to the uses of impertinence, Mr Smith.'\r\n\r\nPsmith started.\r\n\r\n'You are not suggesting--! You do not mean that I--!'\r\n\r\n'I have no more to say. I shall be glad if you will allow me to read my\r\npaper.'\r\n\r\nPsmith waved a damp hand.\r\n\r\n'I should be the last man,' he said stiffly, 'to force my conversation\r\non another. I was under the impression that you enjoyed these little\r\nchats as keenly as I did. If I was wrong--'\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into a wounded silence. Mr Bickersdyke resumed his perusal\r\nof the evening paper, and presently, laying it down, rose and made his\r\nway to the room where muscular attendants were in waiting to perform\r\nthat blend of Jiu-Jitsu and Catch-as-catch-can which is the most\r\nvaluable and at the same time most painful part of a Turkish Bath.\r\n\r\nIt was not till he was resting on his sofa, swathed from head to foot\r\nin a sheet and smoking a cigarette, that he realized that Psmith was\r\nsharing his compartment.\r\n\r\nHe made the unpleasant discovery just as he had finished his first\r\ncigarette and lighted his second. He was blowing out the match when\r\nPsmith, accompanied by an attendant, appeared in the doorway, and\r\nproceeded to occupy the next sofa to himself. All that feeling of\r\ndreamy peace, which is the reward one receives for allowing oneself to\r\nbe melted like wax and kneaded like bread, left him instantly. He felt\r\nhot and annoyed. To escape was out of the question. Once one has been\r\nscientifically wrapped up by the attendant and placed on one's sofa,\r\none is a fixture. He lay scowling at the ceiling, resolved to combat\r\nall attempt at conversation with a stony silence.\r\n\r\nPsmith, however, did not seem to desire conversation. He lay on his\r\nsofa motionless for a quarter of an hour, then reached out for a large\r\nbook which lay on the table, and began to read.\r\n\r\nWhen he did speak, he seemed to be speaking to himself. Every now and\r\nthen he would murmur a few words, sometimes a single name. In spite of\r\nhimself, Mr Bickersdyke found himself listening.\r\n\r\nAt first the murmurs conveyed nothing to him. Then suddenly a name\r\ncaught his ear. Strowther was the name, and somehow it suggested\r\nsomething to him. He could not say precisely what. It seemed to touch\r\nsome chord of memory. He knew no one of the name of Strowther. He was\r\nsure of that. And yet it was curiously familiar. An unusual name, too.\r\nHe could not help feeling that at one time he must have known it quite\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n'Mr Strowther,' murmured Psmith, 'said that the hon. gentleman's\r\nremarks would have been nothing short of treason, if they had not been\r\nso obviously the mere babblings of an irresponsible lunatic. Cries of\r\n\"Order, order,\" and a voice, \"Sit down, fat-head!\"'\r\n\r\nFor just one moment Mr Bickersdyke's memory poised motionless, like a\r\nhawk about to swoop. Then it darted at the mark. Everything came to him\r\nin a flash. The hands of the clock whizzed back. He was no longer Mr\r\nJohn Bickersdyke, manager of the London branch of the New Asiatic Bank,\r\nlying on a sofa in the Cumberland Street Turkish Baths. He was Jack\r\nBickersdyke, clerk in the employ of Messrs Norton and Biggleswade,\r\nstanding on a chair and shouting 'Order! order!' in the Masonic Room of\r\nthe 'Red Lion' at Tulse Hill, while the members of the Tulse Hill\r\nParliament, divided into two camps, yelled at one another, and young\r\nTom Barlow, in his official capacity as Mister Speaker, waved his arms\r\ndumbly, and banged the table with his mallet in his efforts to restore\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the whole affair as if it had happened yesterday. It had\r\nbeen a speech of his own which had called forth the above expression of\r\nopinion from Strowther. He remembered Strowther now, a pale, spectacled\r\nclerk in Baxter and Abrahams, an inveterate upholder of the throne, the\r\nHouse of Lords and all constituted authority. Strowther had objected to\r\nthe socialistic sentiments of his speech in connection with the Budget,\r\nand there had been a disturbance unparalleled even in the Tulse Hill\r\nParliament, where disturbances were frequent and loud....\r\n\r\nPsmith looked across at him with a bright smile. 'They report you\r\nverbatim,' he said. 'And rightly. A more able speech I have seldom\r\nread. I like the bit where you call the Royal Family \"blood-suckers\".\r\nEven then, it seems you knew how to express yourself fluently and\r\nwell.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke sat up. The hands of the clock had moved again, and he\r\nwas back in what Psmith had called the live, vivid present.\r\n\r\n'What have you got there?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'It is a record,' said Psmith, 'of the meeting of an institution called\r\nthe Tulse Hill Parliament. A bright, chatty little institution, too, if\r\none may judge by these reports. You in particular, if I may say so,\r\nappear to have let yourself go with refreshing vim. Your political\r\nviews have changed a great deal since those days, have they not? It is\r\nextremely interesting. A most fascinating study for political students.\r\nWhen I send these speeches of yours to the _Clarion_--'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke bounded on his sofa.\r\n\r\n'What!' he cried.\r\n\r\n'I was saying,' said Psmith, 'that the _Clarion_ will probably\r\nmake a most interesting comparison between these speeches and those you\r\nhave been making at Kenningford.'\r\n\r\n'I--I--I forbid you to make any mention of these speeches.'\r\n\r\nPsmith hesitated.\r\n\r\n'It would be great fun seeing what the papers said,' he protested.\r\n\r\n'Great fun!'\r\n\r\n'It is true,' mused Psmith, 'that in a measure, it would dish you at\r\nthe election. From what I saw of those light-hearted lads at\r\nKenningford the other night, I should say they would be so amused that\r\nthey would only just have enough strength left to stagger to the poll\r\nand vote for your opponent.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke broke out into a cold perspiration.\r\n\r\n'I forbid you to send those speeches to the papers,' he cried.\r\n\r\nPsmith reflected.\r\n\r\n'You see,' he said at last, 'it is like this. The departure of Comrade\r\nJackson, my confidential secretary and adviser, is certain to plunge me\r\ninto a state of the deepest gloom. The only way I can see at present by\r\nwhich I can ensure even a momentary lightening of the inky cloud is the\r\nsending of these speeches to some bright paper like the _Clarion._\r\nI feel certain that their comments would wring, at any rate, a sad,\r\nsweet smile from me. Possibly even a hearty laugh. I must, therefore,\r\nlook on these very able speeches of yours in something of the light of\r\nan antidote. They will stand between me and black depression. Without\r\nthem I am in the cart. With them I may possibly buoy myself up.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke shifted uneasily on his sofa. He glared at the floor.\r\nThen he eyed the ceiling as if it were a personal enemy of his. Finally\r\nhe looked at Psmith. Psmith's eyes were closed in peaceful meditation.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said he at last. 'Jackson shall stop.'\r\n\r\nPsmith came out of his thoughts with a start. 'You were observing--?'\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n'I shall not dismiss Jackson,' said Mr Bickersdyke.\r\n\r\nPsmith smiled winningly.\r\n\r\n'Just as I had hoped,' he said. 'Your very justifiable anger melts\r\nbefore reflection. The storm subsides, and you are at leisure to\r\nexamine the matter dispassionately. Doubts begin to creep in. Possibly,\r\nyou say to yourself, I have been too hasty, too harsh. Justice must be\r\ntempered with mercy. I have caught Comrade Jackson bending, you add\r\n(still to yourself), but shall I press home my advantage too\r\nruthlessly? No, you cry, I will abstain. And I applaud your action. I\r\nlike to see this spirit of gentle toleration. It is bracing and\r\ncomforting. As for these excellent speeches,' he added, 'I shall, of\r\ncourse, no longer have any need of their consolation. I can lay them\r\naside. The sunlight can now enter and illumine my life through more\r\nordinary channels. The cry goes round, \"Psmith is himself again.\"'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke said nothing. Unless a snort of fury may be counted as\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. The Spirit of Unrest\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the following fortnight, two things happened which materially\r\naltered Mike's position in the bank.\r\n\r\nThe first was that Mr Bickersdyke was elected a member of Parliament.\r\nHe got in by a small majority amidst scenes of disorder of a nature\r\nunusual even in Kenningford. Psmith, who went down on the polling-day\r\nto inspect the revels and came back with his hat smashed in, reported\r\nthat, as far as he could see, the electors of Kenningford seemed to be\r\nin just that state of happy intoxication which might make them vote for\r\nMr Bickersdyke by mistake. Also it had been discovered, on the eve of\r\nthe poll, that the bank manager's opponent, in his youth, had been\r\neducated at a school in Germany, and had subsequently spent two years\r\nat Heidelberg University. These damaging revelations were having a\r\nmarked effect on the warm-hearted patriots of Kenningford, who were now\r\nreferring to the candidate in thick but earnest tones as 'the German\r\nSpy'.\r\n\r\n'So that taking everything into consideration,' said Psmith, summing\r\nup, 'I fancy that Comrade Bickersdyke is home.'\r\n\r\nAnd the papers next day proved that he was right.\r\n\r\n'A hundred and fifty-seven,' said Psmith, as he read his paper at\r\nbreakfast. 'Not what one would call a slashing victory. It is fortunate\r\nfor Comrade Bickersdyke, I think, that I did not send those very able\r\nspeeches of his to the _Clarion'_.\r\n\r\nTill now Mike had been completely at a loss to understand why the\r\nmanager had sent for him on the morning following the scene about the\r\ncheque, and informed him that he had reconsidered his decision to\r\ndismiss him. Mike could not help feeling that there was more in the\r\nmatter than met the eye. Mr Bickersdyke had not spoken as if it gave\r\nhim any pleasure to reprieve him. On the contrary, his manner was\r\ndistinctly brusque. Mike was thoroughly puzzled. To Psmith's statement,\r\nthat he had talked the matter over quietly with the manager and brought\r\nthings to a satisfactory conclusion, he had paid little attention. But\r\nnow he began to see light.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott, Smith,' he said, 'did you tell him you'd send those\r\nspeeches to the papers if he sacked me?'\r\n\r\nPsmith looked at him through his eye-glass, and helped himself to\r\nanother piece of toast.\r\n\r\n'I am unable,' he said, 'to recall at this moment the exact terms of\r\nthe very pleasant conversation I had with Comrade Bickersdyke on the\r\noccasion of our chance meeting in the Turkish Bath that afternoon; but,\r\nthinking things over quietly now that I have more leisure, I cannot\r\nhelp feeling that he may possibly have read some such intention into my\r\nwords. You know how it is in these little chats, Comrade Jackson. One\r\nleaps to conclusions. Some casual word I happened to drop may have\r\ngiven him the idea you mention. At this distance of time it is\r\nimpossible to say with any certainty. Suffice it that all has ended\r\nwell. He _did_ reconsider his resolve. I shall be only too happy\r\nif it turns out that the seed of the alteration in his views was sown\r\nby some careless word of mine. Perhaps we shall never know.'\r\n\r\nMike was beginning to mumble some awkward words of thanks, when Psmith\r\nresumed his discourse.\r\n\r\n'Be that as it may, however,' he said, 'we cannot but perceive that\r\nComrade Bickersdyke's election has altered our position to some extent.\r\nAs you have pointed out, he may have been influenced in this recent\r\naffair by some chance remark of mine about those speeches. Now,\r\nhowever, they will cease to be of any value. Now that he is elected he\r\nhas nothing to lose by their publication. I mention this by way of\r\nindicating that it is possible that, if another painful episode occurs,\r\nhe may be more ruthless.'\r\n\r\n'I see what you mean,' said Mike. 'If he catches me on the hop again,\r\nhe'll simply go ahead and sack me.'\r\n\r\n'That,' said Psmith, 'is more or less the position of affairs.'\r\n\r\nThe other event which altered Mike's life in the bank was his removal\r\nfrom Mr Waller's department to the Fixed Deposits. The work in the\r\nFixed Deposits was less pleasant, and Mr Gregory, the head of the\r\ndepartment was not of Mr Waller's type. Mr Gregory, before joining the\r\nhome-staff of the New Asiatic Bank, had spent a number of years with a\r\nfirm in the Far East, where he had acquired a liver and a habit of\r\naddressing those under him in a way that suggested the mate of a tramp\r\nsteamer. Even on the days when his liver was not troubling him, he was\r\ntruculent. And when, as usually happened, it did trouble him, he was a\r\nperfect fountain of abuse. Mike and he hated each other from the first.\r\nThe work in the Fixed Deposits was not really difficult, when you got\r\nthe hang of it, but there was a certain amount of confusion in it to a\r\nbeginner; and Mike, in commercial matters, was as raw a beginner as\r\never began. In the two other departments through which he had passed,\r\nhe had done tolerably well. As regarded his work in the Postage\r\nDepartment, stamping letters and taking them down to the post office\r\nwas just about his form. It was the sort of work on which he could\r\nreally get a grip. And in the Cash Department, Mr Waller's mild\r\npatience had helped him through. But with Mr Gregory it was different.\r\nMike hated being shouted at. It confused him. And Mr Gregory invariably\r\nshouted. He always spoke as if he were competing against a high wind.\r\nWith Mike he shouted more than usual. On his side, it must be admitted\r\nthat Mike was something out of the common run of bank clerks. The whole\r\nsystem of banking was a horrid mystery to him. He did not understand\r\nwhy things were done, or how the various departments depended on and\r\ndove-tailed into one another. Each department seemed to him something\r\nseparate and distinct. Why they were all in the same building at all he\r\nnever really gathered. He knew that it could not be purely from motives\r\nof sociability, in order that the clerks might have each other's\r\ncompany during slack spells. That much he suspected, but beyond that he\r\nwas vague.\r\n\r\nIt naturally followed that, after having grown, little by little, under\r\nMr Waller's easy-going rule, to enjoy life in the bank, he now suffered\r\na reaction. Within a day of his arrival in the Fixed Deposits he was\r\nloathing the place as earnestly as he had loathed it on the first\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nPsmith, who had taken his place in the Cash Department, reported that\r\nMr Waller was inconsolable at his loss.\r\n\r\n'I do my best to cheer him up,' he said, 'and he smiles bravely every\r\nnow and then. But when he thinks I am not looking, his head droops and\r\nthat wistful expression comes into his face. The sunshine has gone out\r\nof his life.'\r\n\r\nIt had just come into Mike's, and, more than anything else, was making\r\nhim restless and discontented. That is to say, it was now late spring:\r\nthe sun shone cheerfully on the City; and cricket was in the air. And\r\nthat was the trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the dark days, when everything was fog and slush, Mike had been\r\ncontented enough to spend his mornings and afternoons in the bank, and\r\ngo about with Psmith at night. Under such conditions, London is the\r\nbest place in which to be, and the warmth and light of the bank were\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nBut now things had changed. The place had become a prison. With all the\r\nenergy of one who had been born and bred in the country, Mike hated\r\nhaving to stay indoors on days when all the air was full of approaching\r\nsummer. There were mornings when it was almost more than he could do to\r\npush open the swing doors, and go out of the fresh air into the stuffy\r\natmosphere of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe days passed slowly, and the cricket season began. Instead of being\r\na relief, this made matters worse. The little cricket he could get only\r\nmade him want more. It was as if a starving man had been given a\r\nhandful of wafer biscuits.\r\n\r\nIf the summer had been wet, he might have been less restless. But, as\r\nit happened, it was unusually fine. After a week of cold weather at the\r\nbeginning of May, a hot spell set in. May passed in a blaze of\r\nsunshine. Large scores were made all over the country.\r\n\r\nMike's name had been down for the M.C.C. for some years, and he had\r\nbecome a member during his last season at Wrykyn. Once or twice a week\r\nhe managed to get up to Lord's for half an hour's practice at the nets;\r\nand on Saturdays the bank had matches, in which he generally managed to\r\nknock the cover off rather ordinary club bowling. But it was not enough\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nJune came, and with it more sunshine. The atmosphere of the bank seemed\r\nmore oppressive than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. At the Telephone\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one looks closely into those actions which are apparently due to\r\nsudden impulse, one generally finds that the sudden impulse was merely\r\nthe last of a long series of events which led up to the action. Alone,\r\nit would not have been powerful enough to effect anything. But, coming\r\nafter the way has been paved for it, it is irresistible. The hooligan\r\nwho bonnets a policeman is apparently the victim of a sudden impulse.\r\nIn reality, however, the bonneting is due to weeks of daily encounters\r\nwith the constable, at each of which meetings the dislike for his\r\nhelmet and the idea of smashing it in grow a little larger, till\r\nfinally they blossom into the deed itself.\r\n\r\nThis was what happened in Mike's case. Day by day, through the summer,\r\nas the City grew hotter and stuffier, his hatred of the bank became\r\nmore and more the thought that occupied his mind. It only needed a\r\nmoderately strong temptation to make him break out and take the\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nPsmith noticed his restlessness and endeavoured to soothe it.\r\n\r\n'All is not well,' he said, 'with Comrade Jackson, the Sunshine of the\r\nHome. I note a certain wanness of the cheek. The peach-bloom of your\r\ncomplexion is no longer up to sample. Your eye is wild; your merry\r\nlaugh no longer rings through the bank, causing nervous customers to\r\nleap into the air with startled exclamations. You have the manner of\r\none whose only friend on earth is a yellow dog, and who has lost the\r\ndog. Why is this, Comrade Jackson?'\r\n\r\nThey were talking in the flat at Clement's Inn. The night was hot.\r\nThrough the open windows the roar of the Strand sounded faintly. Mike\r\nwalked to the window and looked out.\r\n\r\n'I'm sick of all this rot,' he said shortly.\r\n\r\nPsmith shot an inquiring glance at him, but said nothing. This\r\nrestlessness of Mike's was causing him a good deal of inconvenience,\r\nwhich he bore in patient silence, hoping for better times. With Mike\r\nobviously discontented and out of tune with all the world, there was\r\nbut little amusement to be extracted from the evenings now. Mike did\r\nhis best to be cheerful, but he could not shake off the caged feeling\r\nwhich made him restless.\r\n\r\n'What rot it all is!' went on Mike, sitting down again. 'What's the\r\ngood of it all? You go and sweat all day at a desk, day after day, for\r\nabout twopence a year. And when you're about eighty-five, you retire.\r\nIt isn't living at all. It's simply being a bally vegetable.'\r\n\r\n'You aren't hankering, by any chance, to be a pirate of the Spanish\r\nmain, or anything like that, are you?' inquired Psmith.\r\n\r\n'And all this rot about going out East,' continued Mike. 'What's the\r\ngood of going out East?'\r\n\r\n'I gather from casual chit-chat in the office that one becomes\r\nsomething of a blood when one goes out East,' said Psmith. 'Have\r\na dozen native clerks under you, all looking up to you as the Last\r\nWord in magnificence, and end by marrying the Governor's daughter.'\r\n\r\n'End by getting some foul sort of fever, more likely, and being booted\r\nout as no further use to the bank.'\r\n\r\n'You look on the gloomy side, Comrade Jackson. I seem to see you\r\nsitting in an armchair, fanned by devoted coolies, telling some Eastern\r\npotentate that you can give him five minutes. I understand that being\r\nin a bank in the Far East is one of the world's softest jobs. Millions\r\nof natives hang on your lightest word. Enthusiastic rajahs draw you\r\naside and press jewels into your hand as a token of respect and esteem.\r\nWhen on an elephant's back you pass, somebody beats on a booming brass\r\ngong! The Banker of Bhong! Isn't your generous young heart stirred to\r\nany extent by the prospect? I am given to understand--'\r\n\r\n'I've a jolly good mind to chuck up the whole thing and become a pro.\r\nI've got a birth qualification for Surrey. It's about the only thing I\r\ncould do any good at.'\r\n\r\nPsmith's manner became fatherly.\r\n\r\n'_You're_ all right,' he said. 'The hot weather has given you that\r\ntired feeling. What you want is a change of air. We will pop down\r\ntogether hand in hand this week-end to some seaside resort. You shall\r\nbuild sand castles, while I lie on the beach and read the paper. In the\r\nevening we will listen to the band, or stroll on the esplanade, not so\r\nmuch because we want to, as to give the natives a treat. Possibly, if\r\nthe weather continues warm, we may even paddle. A vastly exhilarating\r\npastime, I am led to believe, and so strengthening for the ankles. And\r\non Monday morning we will return, bronzed and bursting with health, to\r\nour toil once more.'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to bed,' said Mike, rising.\r\n\r\nPsmith watched him lounge from the room, and shook his head sadly. All\r\nwas not well with his confidential secretary and adviser.\r\n\r\nThe next day, which was a Thursday, found Mike no more reconciled to\r\nthe prospect of spending from ten till five in the company of Mr\r\nGregory and the ledgers. He was silent at breakfast, and Psmith, seeing\r\nthat things were still wrong, abstained from conversation. Mike propped\r\nthe _Sportsman_ up against the hot-water jug, and read the cricket\r\nnews. His county, captained by brother Joe, had, as he had learned\r\nalready from yesterday's evening paper, beaten Sussex by five wickets\r\nat Brighton. Today they were due to play Middlesex at Lord's. Mike\r\nthought that he would try to get off early, and go and see some of the\r\nfirst day's play.\r\n\r\nAs events turned out, he got off a good deal earlier, and saw a good\r\ndeal more of the first day's play than he had anticipated.\r\n\r\nHe had just finished the preliminary stages of the morning's work,\r\nwhich consisted mostly of washing his hands, changing his coat, and\r\neating a section of a pen-holder, when William, the messenger,\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n'You're wanted on the 'phone, Mr Jackson.'\r\n\r\nThe New Asiatic Bank, unlike the majority of London banks, was on the\r\ntelephone, a fact which Psmith found a great convenience when securing\r\nseats at the theatre. Mike went to the box and took up the receiver.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' he said.\r\n\r\n'Who's that?' said an agitated voice. 'Is that you, Mike? I'm Joe.'\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Joe,' said Mike. 'What's up? I'm coming to see you this\r\nevening. I'm going to try and get off early.'\r\n\r\n'Look here, Mike, are you busy at the bank just now?'\r\n\r\n'Not at the moment. There's never anything much going on before\r\neleven.'\r\n\r\n'I mean, are you busy today? Could you possibly manage to get off and\r\nplay for us against Middlesex?'\r\n\r\nMike nearly dropped the receiver.\r\n\r\n'What?' he cried.\r\n\r\n'There's been the dickens of a mix-up. We're one short, and you're our\r\nonly hope. We can't possibly get another man in the time. We start in\r\nhalf an hour. Can you play?'\r\n\r\nFor the space of, perhaps, one minute, Mike thought.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Joe's voice.\r\n\r\nThe sudden vision of Lord's ground, all green and cool in the morning\r\nsunlight, was too much for Mike's resolution, sapped as it was by days\r\nof restlessness. The feeling surged over him that whatever happened\r\nafterwards, the joy of the match in perfect weather on a perfect wicket\r\nwould make it worth while. What did it matter what happened afterwards?\r\n\r\n'All right, Joe,' he said. 'I'll hop into a cab now, and go and get my\r\nthings.'\r\n\r\n'Good man,' said Joe, hugely relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26. Breaking The News\r\n\r\n\r\nDashing away from the call-box, Mike nearly cannoned into Psmith, who\r\nwas making his way pensively to the telephone with the object of\r\nringing up the box office of the Haymarket Theatre.\r\n\r\n'Sorry,' said Mike. 'Hullo, Smith.'\r\n\r\n'Hullo indeed,' said Psmith, courteously. 'I rejoice, Comrade Jackson,\r\nto find you going about your commercial duties like a young bomb. How\r\nis it, people repeatedly ask me, that Comrade Jackson contrives to\r\ncatch his employer's eye and win the friendly smile from the head of\r\nhis department? My reply is that where others walk, Comrade Jackson\r\nruns. Where others stroll, Comrade Jackson legs it like a highly-trained\r\nmustang of the prairie. He does not loiter. He gets back to his department\r\nbathed in perspiration, in level time. He--'\r\n\r\n'I say, Smith,' said Mike, 'you might do me a favour.'\r\n\r\n'A thousand. Say on.'\r\n\r\n'Just look in at the Fixed Deposits and tell old Gregory that I shan't\r\nbe with him today, will you? I haven't time myself. I must rush!'\r\n\r\nPsmith screwed his eyeglass into his eye, and examined Mike carefully.\r\n\r\n'What exactly--?' be began.\r\n\r\n'Tell the old ass I've popped off.'\r\n\r\n'Just so, just so,' murmured Psmith, as one who assents to a thoroughly\r\nreasonable proposition. 'Tell him you have popped off. It shall be\r\ndone. But it is within the bounds of possibility that Comrade Gregory\r\nmay inquire further. Could you give me some inkling as to why you are\r\npopping?'\r\n\r\n'My brother Joe has just rung me up from Lords. The county are playing\r\nMiddlesex and they're one short. He wants me to roll up.'\r\n\r\nPsmith shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n'I don't wish to interfere in any way,' he said, 'but I suppose you\r\nrealize that, by acting thus, you are to some extent knocking the\r\nstuffing out of your chances of becoming manager of this bank? If you\r\ndash off now, I shouldn't count too much on that marrying the\r\nGovernor's daughter scheme I sketched out for you last night. I doubt\r\nwhether this is going to help you to hold the gorgeous East in fee, and\r\nall that sort of thing.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, dash the gorgeous East.'\r\n\r\n'By all means,' said Psmith obligingly. 'I just thought I'd mention it.\r\nI'll look in at Lord's this afternoon. I shall send my card up to you,\r\nand trust to your sympathetic cooperation to enable me to effect an\r\nentry into the pavilion on my face. My father is coming up to London\r\ntoday. I'll bring him along, too.'\r\n\r\n'Right ho. Dash it, it's twenty to. So long. See you at Lord's.'\r\n\r\nPsmith looked after his retreating form till it had vanished through\r\nthe swing-door, and shrugged his shoulders resignedly, as if\r\ndisclaiming all responsibility.\r\n\r\n'He has gone without his hat,' he murmured. 'It seems to me that this\r\nis practically a case of running amok. And now to break the news to\r\nbereaved Comrade Gregory.'\r\n\r\nHe abandoned his intention of ringing up the Haymarket Theatre, and\r\nturning away from the call-box, walked meditatively down the aisle till\r\nhe came to the Fixed Deposits Department, where the top of Mr Gregory's\r\nhead was to be seen over the glass barrier, as he applied himself to\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nPsmith, resting his elbows on the top of the barrier and holding his\r\nhead between his hands, eyed the absorbed toiler for a moment in\r\nsilence, then emitted a hollow groan.\r\n\r\nMr Gregory, who was ruling a line in a ledger--most of the work in the\r\nFixed Deposits Department consisted of ruling lines in ledgers,\r\nsometimes in black ink, sometimes in red--started as if he had been\r\nstung, and made a complete mess of the ruled line. He lifted a fiery,\r\nbearded face, and met Psmith's eye, which shone with kindly sympathy.\r\n\r\nHe found words.\r\n\r\n'What the dickens are you standing there for, mooing like a blanked\r\ncow?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n'I was groaning,' explained Psmith with quiet dignity. 'And why was I\r\ngroaning?' he continued. 'Because a shadow has fallen on the Fixed\r\nDeposits Department. Comrade Jackson, the Pride of the Office, has\r\ngone.'\r\n\r\nMr Gregory rose from his seat.\r\n\r\n'I don't know who the dickens you are--' he began.\r\n\r\n'I am Psmith,' said the old Etonian,\r\n\r\n'Oh, you're Smith, are you?'\r\n\r\n'With a preliminary P. Which, however, is not sounded.'\r\n\r\n'And what's all this dashed nonsense about Jackson?'\r\n\r\n'He is gone. Gone like the dew from the petal of a rose.'\r\n\r\n'Gone! Where's he gone to?'\r\n\r\n'Lord's.'\r\n\r\n'What lord's?'\r\n\r\nPsmith waved his hand gently.\r\n\r\n'You misunderstand me. Comrade Jackson has not gone to mix with any\r\nmember of our gay and thoughtless aristocracy. He has gone to Lord's\r\ncricket ground.'\r\n\r\nMr Gregory's beard bristled even more than was its wont.\r\n\r\n'What!' he roared. 'Gone to watch a cricket match! Gone--!'\r\n\r\n'Not to watch. To play. An urgent summons I need not say. Nothing but\r\nan urgent summons could have wrenched him from your very delightful\r\nsociety, I am sure.'\r\n\r\nMr Gregory glared.\r\n\r\n'I don't want any of your impudence,' he said.\r\n\r\nPsmith nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n'We all have these curious likes and dislikes,' he said tolerantly.\r\n'You do not like my impudence. Well, well, some people don't. And now,\r\nhaving broken the sad news, I will return to my own department.'\r\n\r\n'Half a minute. You come with me and tell this yarn of yours to Mr\r\nBickersdyke.'\r\n\r\n'You think it would interest, amuse him? Perhaps you are right. Let us\r\nbuttonhole Comrade Bickersdyke.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke was disengaged. The head of the Fixed Deposits\r\nDepartment stumped into the room. Psmith followed at a more leisurely\r\npace.\r\n\r\n'Allow me,' he said with a winning smile, as Mr Gregory opened his\r\nmouth to speak, 'to take this opportunity of congratulating you on your\r\nsuccess at the election. A narrow but well-deserved victory.'\r\n\r\nThere was nothing cordial in the manager's manner.\r\n\r\n'What do you want?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Myself, nothing,' said Psmith. 'But I understand that Mr Gregory has\r\nsome communication to make.'\r\n\r\n'Tell Mr Bickersdyke that story of yours,' said Mr Gregory.\r\n\r\n'Surely,' said Psmith reprovingly, 'this is no time for anecdotes. Mr\r\nBickersdyke is busy. He--'\r\n\r\n'Tell him what you told me about Jackson.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke looked up inquiringly.\r\n\r\n'Jackson,' said Psmith, 'has been obliged to absent himself from work\r\ntoday owing to an urgent summons from his brother, who, I understand,\r\nhas suffered a bereavement.'\r\n\r\n'It's a lie,' roared Mr Gregory. 'You told me yourself he'd gone to\r\nplay in a cricket match.'\r\n\r\n'True. As I said, he received an urgent summons from his brother.'\r\n\r\n'What about the bereavement, then?'\r\n\r\n'The team was one short. His brother was very distressed about it. What\r\ncould Comrade Jackson do? Could he refuse to help his brother when it\r\nwas in his power? His generous nature is a byword. He did the only\r\npossible thing. He consented to play.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke spoke.\r\n\r\n'Am I to understand,' he asked, with sinister calm, 'that Mr Jackson\r\nhas left his work and gone off to play in a cricket match?'\r\n\r\n'Something of that sort has, I believe, happened,' said Psmith. 'He\r\nknew, of course,' he added, bowing gracefully in Mr Gregory's\r\ndirection, 'that he was leaving his work in thoroughly competent\r\nhands.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said Mr Bickersdyke. 'That will do. You will help Mr\r\nGregory in his department for the time being, Mr Smith. I will arrange\r\nfor somebody to take your place in your own department.'\r\n\r\n'It will be a pleasure,' murmured Psmith.\r\n\r\n'Show Mr Smith what he has to do, Mr Gregory,' said the manager.\r\n\r\nThey left the room.\r\n\r\n'How curious, Comrade Gregory,' mused Psmith, as they went, 'are the\r\nworkings of Fate! A moment back, and your life was a blank. Comrade\r\nJackson, that prince of Fixed Depositors, had gone. How, you said to\r\nyourself despairingly, can his place be filled? Then the cloud broke,\r\nand the sun shone out again. _I_ came to help you. What you lose\r\non the swings, you make up on the roundabouts. Now show me what I have\r\nto do, and then let us make this department sizzle. You have drawn a\r\ngood ticket, Comrade Gregory.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27. At Lord's\r\n\r\n\r\nMike got to Lord's just as the umpires moved out into the field. He\r\nraced round to the pavilion. Joe met him on the stairs.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' he said. 'No hurry. We've won the toss. I've put you\r\nin fourth wicket.'\r\n\r\n'Right ho,' said Mike. 'Glad we haven't to field just yet.'\r\n\r\n'We oughtn't to have to field today if we don't chuck our wickets\r\naway.'\r\n\r\n'Good wicket?'\r\n\r\n'Like a billiard-table. I'm glad you were able to come. Have any\r\ndifficulty in getting away?'\r\n\r\nJoe Jackson's knowledge of the workings of a bank was of the slightest.\r\nHe himself had never, since he left Oxford, been in a position where\r\nthere were obstacles to getting off to play in first-class cricket. By\r\nprofession he was agent to a sporting baronet whose hobby was the\r\ncricket of the county, and so, far from finding any difficulty in\r\nplaying for the county, he was given to understand by his employer that\r\nthat was his chief duty. It never occurred to him that Mike might find\r\nhis bank less amenable in the matter of giving leave. His only fear,\r\nwhen he rang Mike up that morning, had been that this might be a\r\nparticularly busy day at the New Asiatic Bank. If there was no special\r\nrush of work, he took it for granted that Mike would simply go to the\r\nmanager, ask for leave to play in the match, and be given it with a\r\nbeaming smile.\r\n\r\nMike did not answer the question, but asked one on his own account.\r\n\r\n'How did you happen to be short?' he said.\r\n\r\n'It was rotten luck. It was like this. We were altering our team after\r\nthe Sussex match, to bring in Ballard, Keene, and Willis. They couldn't\r\nget down to Brighton, as the 'Varsity had a match, but there was\r\nnothing on for them in the last half of the week, so they'd promised to\r\nroll up.'\r\n\r\nBallard, Keene, and Willis were members of the Cambridge team, all very\r\ncapable performers and much in demand by the county, when they could\r\nget away to play for it.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'Well, we all came up by train from Brighton last night. But these\r\nthree asses had arranged to motor down from Cambridge early today, and\r\nget here in time for the start. What happens? Why, Willis, who fancies\r\nhimself as a chauffeur, undertakes to do the driving; and naturally,\r\nbeing an absolute rotter, goes and smashes up the whole concern just\r\noutside St Albans. The first thing I knew of it was when I got to\r\nLord's at half past ten, and found a wire waiting for me to say that\r\nthey were all three of them crocked, and couldn't possibly play. I tell\r\nyou, it was a bit of a jar to get half an hour before the match\r\nstarted. Willis has sprained his ankle, apparently; Keene's damaged his\r\nwrist; and Ballard has smashed his collar-bone. I don't suppose they'll\r\nbe able to play in the 'Varsity match. Rotten luck for Cambridge. Well,\r\nfortunately we'd had two reserve pros, with us at Brighton, who had\r\ncome up to London with the team in case they might be wanted, so, with\r\nthem, we were only one short. Then I thought of you. That's how it\r\nwas.'\r\n\r\n'I see,' said Mike. 'Who are the pros?'\r\n\r\n'Davis and Brockley. Both bowlers. It weakens our batting a lot.\r\nBallard or Willis might have got a stack of runs on this wicket. Still,\r\nwe've got a certain amount of batting as it is. We oughtn't to do\r\nbadly, if we're careful. You've been getting some practice, I suppose,\r\nthis season?'\r\n\r\n'In a sort of a way. Nets and so on. No matches of any importance.'\r\n\r\n'Dash it, I wish you'd had a game or two in decent class cricket.\r\nStill, nets are better than nothing, I hope you'll be in form. We may\r\nwant a pretty long knock from you, if things go wrong. These men seem\r\nto be settling down all right, thank goodness,' he added, looking out\r\nof the window at the county's first pair, Warrington and Mills, two\r\nprofessionals, who, as the result of ten minutes' play, had put up\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\n'I'd better go and change,' said Mike, picking up his bag. 'You're in\r\nfirst wicket, I suppose?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. And Reggie, second wicket.'\r\n\r\nReggie was another of Mike's brothers, not nearly so fine a player as\r\nJoe, but a sound bat, who generally made runs if allowed to stay in.\r\n\r\nMike changed, and went out into the little balcony at the top of the\r\npavilion. He had it to himself. There were not many spectators in the\r\npavilion at this early stage of the game.\r\n\r\nThere are few more restful places, if one wishes to think, than the\r\nupper balconies of Lord's pavilion. Mike, watching the game making its\r\nleisurely progress on the turf below, set himself seriously to review\r\nthe situation in all its aspects. The exhilaration of bursting the\r\nbonds had begun to fade, and he found himself able to look into the\r\nmatter of his desertion and weigh up the consequences. There was no\r\ndoubt that he had cut the painter once and for all. Even a\r\nfriendly-disposed management could hardly overlook what he had done.\r\nAnd the management of the New Asiatic Bank was the very reverse of\r\nfriendly. Mr Bickersdyke, he knew, would jump at this chance of getting\r\nrid of him. He realized that he must look on his career in the bank as\r\na closed book. It was definitely over, and he must now think about the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIt was not a time for half-measures. He could not go home. He must\r\ncarry the thing through, now that he had begun, and find something\r\ndefinite to do, to support himself.\r\n\r\nThere seemed only one opening for him. What could he do, he asked\r\nhimself. Just one thing. He could play cricket. It was by his cricket\r\nthat he must live. He would have to become a professional. Could he get\r\ntaken on? That was the question. It was impossible that he should play\r\nfor his own county on his residential qualification. He could not\r\nappear as a professional in the same team in which his brothers were\r\nplaying as amateurs. He must stake all on his birth qualification for\r\nSurrey.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, had he the credentials which Surrey would want? He\r\nhad a school reputation. But was that enough? He could not help feeling\r\nthat it might not be.\r\n\r\nThinking it over more tensely than he had ever thought over anything in\r\nhis whole life, he saw clearly that everything depended on what sort of\r\nshow he made in this match which was now in progress. It was his big\r\nchance. If he succeeded, all would be well. He did not care to think\r\nwhat his position would be if he did not succeed.\r\n\r\nA distant appeal and a sound of clapping from the crowd broke in on his\r\nthoughts. Mills was out, caught at the wicket. The telegraph-board gave\r\nthe total as forty-eight. Not sensational. The success of the team\r\ndepended largely on what sort of a start the two professionals made.\r\n\r\nThe clapping broke out again as Joe made his way down the steps. Joe,\r\nas an All England player, was a favourite with the crowd.\r\n\r\nMike watched him play an over in his strong, graceful style: then it\r\nsuddenly occurred to him that he would like to know how matters had\r\ngone at the bank in his absence.\r\n\r\nHe went down to the telephone, rang up the bank, and asked for Psmith.\r\n\r\nPresently the familiar voice made itself heard.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Smith.'\r\n\r\n'Hullo. Is that Comrade Jackson? How are things progressing?'\r\n\r\n'Fairly well. We're in first. We've lost one wicket, and the fifty's\r\njust up. I say, what's happened at the bank?'\r\n\r\n'I broke the news to Comrade Gregory. A charming personality. I feel\r\nthat we shall be friends.'\r\n\r\n'Was he sick?'\r\n\r\n'In a measure, yes. Indeed, I may say he practically foamed at the\r\nmouth. I explained the situation, but he was not to be appeased. He\r\njerked me into the presence of Comrade Bickersdyke, with whom I had a\r\nbrief but entertaining chat. He had not a great deal to say, but he\r\nlistened attentively to my narrative, and eventually told me off to\r\ntake your place in the Fixed Deposits. That melancholy task I am now\r\nperforming to the best of my ability. I find the work a little trying.\r\nThere is too much ledger-lugging to be done for my simple tastes. I\r\nhave been hauling ledgers from the safe all the morning. The cry is\r\nbeginning to go round, \"Psmith is willing, but can his physique stand\r\nthe strain?\" In the excitement of the moment just now I dropped a\r\nsomewhat massive tome on to Comrade Gregory's foot, unfortunately, I\r\nunderstand, the foot in which he has of late been suffering twinges of\r\ngout. I passed the thing off with ready tact, but I cannot deny that\r\nthere was a certain temporary coolness, which, indeed, is not yet past.\r\nThese things, Comrade Jackson, are the whirlpools in the quiet stream\r\nof commercial life.'\r\n\r\n'Have I got the sack?'\r\n\r\n'No official pronouncement has been made to me as yet on the subject,\r\nbut I think I should advise you, if you are offered another job in the\r\ncourse of the day, to accept it. I cannot say that you are precisely\r\nthe pet of the management just at present. However, I have ideas for\r\nyour future, which I will divulge when we meet. I propose to slide\r\ncoyly from the office at about four o'clock. I am meeting my father at\r\nthat hour. We shall come straight on to Lord's.'\r\n\r\n'Right ho,' said Mike. 'I'll be looking out for you.'\r\n\r\n'Is there any little message I can give Comrade Gregory from you?'\r\n\r\n'You can give him my love, if you like.'\r\n\r\n'It shall be done. Good-bye.'\r\n\r\n'Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nMike replaced the receiver, and went up to his balcony again.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his eye fell on the telegraph-board he saw with a start that\r\nthings had been moving rapidly in his brief absence. The numbers of the\r\nbatsmen on the board were three and five.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!' he cried. 'Why, I'm in next. What on earth's been\r\nhappening?'\r\n\r\nHe put on his pads hurriedly, expecting every moment that a wicket\r\nwould fall and find him unprepared. But the batsmen were still together\r\nwhen he rose, ready for the fray, and went downstairs to get news.\r\n\r\nHe found his brother Reggie in the dressing-room.\r\n\r\n'What's happened?' he said. 'How were you out?'\r\n\r\n'L.b.w.,' said Reggie. 'Goodness knows how it happened. My eyesight\r\nmust be going. I mistimed the thing altogether.'\r\n\r\n'How was Warrington out?'\r\n\r\n'Caught in the slips.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' said Mike. 'This is pretty rocky. Three for sixty-one. We\r\nshall get mopped.'\r\n\r\n'Unless you and Joe do something. There's no earthly need to get out.\r\nThe wicket's as good as you want, and the bowling's nothing special.\r\nWell played, Joe!'\r\n\r\nA beautiful glide to leg by the greatest of the Jacksons had rolled up\r\nagainst the pavilion rails. The fieldsmen changed across for the next\r\nover.\r\n\r\n'If only Peters stops a bit--' began Mike, and broke off. Peters' off\r\nstump was lying at an angle of forty-five degrees.\r\n\r\n'Well, he hasn't,' said Reggie grimly. 'Silly ass, why did he hit at\r\nthat one? All he'd got to do was to stay in with Joe. Now it's up to\r\nyou. Do try and do something, or we'll be out under the hundred.'\r\n\r\nMike waited till the outcoming batsman had turned in at the\r\nprofessionals' gate. Then he walked down the steps and out into the\r\nopen, feeling more nervous than he had felt since that far-off day when\r\nhe had first gone in to bat for Wrykyn against the M.C.C. He found his\r\nthoughts flying back to that occasion. Today, as then, everything\r\nseemed very distant and unreal. The spectators were miles away. He had\r\noften been to Lord's as a spectator, but the place seemed entirely\r\nunfamiliar now. He felt as if he were in a strange land.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of Joe leaving the crease to meet him on his way. He\r\nsmiled feebly. 'Buck up,' said Joe in that robust way of his which was\r\nso heartening. 'Nothing in the bowling, and the wicket like a shirt-front.\r\nPlay just as if you were at the nets. And for goodness' sake don't try to\r\nscore all your runs in the first over. Stick in, and we've got them.'\r\n\r\nMike smiled again more feebly than before, and made a weird gurgling\r\nnoise in his throat.\r\n\r\nIt had been the Middlesex fast bowler who had destroyed Peters. Mike\r\nwas not sorry. He did not object to fast bowling. He took guard, and\r\nlooked round him, taking careful note of the positions of the slips.\r\n\r\nAs usual, once he was at the wicket the paralysed feeling left him. He\r\nbecame conscious again of his power. Dash it all, what was there to be\r\nafraid of? He was a jolly good bat, and he would jolly well show them\r\nthat he was, too.\r\n\r\nThe fast bowler, with a preliminary bound, began his run. Mike settled\r\nhimself into position, his whole soul concentrated on the ball.\r\nEverything else was wiped from his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28. Psmith Arranges his Future\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was exactly four o'clock when Psmith, sliding unostentatiously from\r\nhis stool, flicked divers pieces of dust from the leg of his trousers,\r\nand sidled towards the basement, where he was wont to keep his hat\r\nduring business hours. He was aware that it would be a matter of some\r\ndelicacy to leave the bank at that hour. There was a certain quantity\r\nof work still to be done in the Fixed Deposits Department--work in\r\nwhich, by rights, as Mike's understudy, he should have lent a\r\nsympathetic and helping hand. 'But what of that?' he mused,\r\nthoughtfully smoothing his hat with his knuckles. 'Comrade Gregory is a\r\nman who takes such an enthusiastic pleasure in his duties that he will\r\ngo singing about the office when he discovers that he has got a double\r\nlot of work to do.'\r\n\r\nWith this comforting thought, he started on his perilous journey to the\r\nopen air. As he walked delicately, not courting observation, he\r\nreminded himself of the hero of 'Pilgrim's Progress'. On all sides of\r\nhim lay fearsome beasts, lying in wait to pounce upon him. At any\r\nmoment Mr Gregory's hoarse roar might shatter the comparative\r\nstillness, or the sinister note of Mr Bickersdyke make itself heard.\r\n\r\n'However,' said Psmith philosophically, 'these are Life's Trials, and\r\nmust be borne patiently.'\r\n\r\nA roundabout route, via the Postage and Inwards Bills Departments, took\r\nhim to the swing-doors. It was here that the danger became acute. The\r\ndoors were well within view of the Fixed Deposits Department, and Mr\r\nGregory had an eye compared with which that of an eagle was more or\r\nless bleared.\r\n\r\nPsmith sauntered to the door and pushed it open in a gingerly manner.\r\n\r\nAs he did so a bellow rang through the office, causing a timid customer,\r\nwho had come in to arrange about an overdraft, to lose his nerve\r\ncompletely and postpone his business till the following afternoon.\r\n\r\nPsmith looked up. Mr Gregory was leaning over the barrier which divided\r\nhis lair from the outer world, and gesticulating violently.\r\n\r\n'Where are you going,' roared the head of the Fixed Deposits.\r\n\r\nPsmith did not reply. With a benevolent smile and a gesture intended to\r\nsignify all would come right in the future, he slid through the\r\nswing-doors, and began to move down the street at a somewhat swifter\r\npace than was his habit.\r\n\r\nOnce round the corner he slackened his speed.\r\n\r\n'This can't go on,' he said to himself. 'This life of commerce is too\r\ngreat a strain. One is practically a hunted hare. Either the heads of\r\nmy department must refrain from View Halloos when they observe me going\r\nfor a stroll, or I abandon Commerce for some less exacting walk in\r\nlife.'\r\n\r\nHe removed his hat, and allowed the cool breeze to play upon his\r\nforehead. The episode had been disturbing.\r\n\r\nHe was to meet his father at the Mansion House. As he reached that\r\nland-mark he saw with approval that punctuality was a virtue of which\r\nhe had not the sole monopoly in the Smith family. His father was\r\nwaiting for him at the tryst.\r\n\r\n'Certainly, my boy,' said Mr Smith senior, all activity in a moment,\r\nwhen Psmith had suggested going to Lord's. 'Excellent. We must be\r\ngetting on. We must not miss a moment of the match. Bless my soul: I\r\nhaven't seen a first-class match this season. Where's a cab? Hi, cabby!\r\nNo, that one's got some one in it. There's another. Hi! Here, lunatic!\r\nAre you blind? Good, he's seen us. That's right. Here he comes. Lord's\r\nCricket Ground, cabby, as quick as you can. Jump in, Rupert, my boy,\r\njump in.'\r\n\r\nPsmith rarely jumped. He entered the cab with something of the\r\nstateliness of an old Roman Emperor boarding his chariot, and settled\r\nhimself comfortably in his seat. Mr Smith dived in like a rabbit.\r\n\r\nA vendor of newspapers came to the cab thrusting an evening paper into\r\nthe interior. Psmith bought it.\r\n\r\n'Let's see how they're getting on,' he said, opening the paper. 'Where\r\nare we? Lunch scores. Lord's. Aha! Comrade Jackson is in form.'\r\n\r\n'Jackson?' said Mr Smith, 'is that the same youngster you brought home\r\nlast summer? The batsman? Is he playing today?'\r\n\r\n'He was not out thirty at lunch-time. He would appear to be making\r\nsomething of a stand with his brother Joe, who has made sixty-one up to\r\nthe moment of going to press. It's possible he may still be in when we\r\nget there. In which case we shall not be able to slide into the\r\npavilion.'\r\n\r\n'A grand bat, that boy. I said so last summer. Better than any of his\r\nbrothers. He's in the bank with you, isn't he?'\r\n\r\n'He was this morning. I doubt, however, whether he can be said to be\r\nstill in that position.'\r\n\r\n'Eh? what? How's that?'\r\n\r\n'There was some slight friction between him and the management. They\r\nwished him to be glued to his stool; he preferred to play for the\r\ncounty. I think we may say that Comrade Jackson has secured the Order\r\nof the Boot.'\r\n\r\n'What? Do you mean to say--?'\r\n\r\nPsmith related briefly the history of Mike's departure.\r\n\r\nMr Smith listened with interest.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he said at last, 'hang me if I blame the boy. It's a sin\r\ncooping up a fellow who can bat like that in a bank. I should have done\r\nthe same myself in his place.'\r\n\r\nPsmith smoothed his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n'Do you know, father,' he said, 'this bank business is far from being\r\nmuch of a catch. Indeed, I should describe it definitely as a bit off.\r\nI have given it a fair trial, and I now denounce it unhesitatingly as a\r\nshade too thick.'\r\n\r\n'What? Are you getting tired of it?'\r\n\r\n'Not precisely tired. But, after considerable reflection, I have come\r\nto the conclusion that my talents lie elsewhere. At lugging ledgers I\r\nam among the also-rans--a mere cipher. I have been wanting to speak to\r\nyou about this for some time. If you have no objection, I should like\r\nto go to the Bar.'\r\n\r\n'The Bar? Well--'\r\n\r\n'I fancy I should make a pretty considerable hit as a barrister.'\r\n\r\nMr Smith reflected. The idea had not occurred to him before. Now that\r\nit was suggested, his always easily-fired imagination took hold of it\r\nreadily. There was a good deal to be said for the Bar as a career.\r\nPsmith knew his father, and he knew that the thing was practically as\r\ngood as settled. It was a new idea, and as such was bound to be\r\nfavourably received.\r\n\r\n'What I should do, if I were you,' he went on, as if he were advising a\r\nfriend on some course of action certain to bring him profit and\r\npleasure, 'is to take me away from the bank at once. Don't wait. There\r\nis no time like the present. Let me hand in my resignation tomorrow.\r\nThe blow to the management, especially to Comrade Bickersdyke, will be\r\na painful one, but it is the truest kindness to administer it swiftly.\r\nLet me resign tomorrow, and devote my time to quiet study. Then I can\r\npop up to Cambridge next term, and all will be well.'\r\n\r\n'I'll think it over--' began Mr Smith.\r\n\r\n'Let us hustle,' urged Psmith. 'Let us Do It Now. It is the only way.\r\nHave I your leave to shoot in my resignation to Comrade Bickersdyke\r\ntomorrow morning?'\r\n\r\nMr Smith hesitated for a moment, then made up his mind.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' he said. 'I really think it is a good idea. There are\r\ngreat opportunities open to a barrister. I wish we had thought of it\r\nbefore.'\r\n\r\n'I am not altogether sorry that we did not,' said Psmith. 'I have\r\nenjoyed the chances my commercial life has given me of associating with\r\nsuch a man as Comrade Bickersdyke. In many ways a master-mind. But\r\nperhaps it is as well to close the chapter. How it happened it is hard\r\nto say, but somehow I fancy I did not precisely hit it off with Comrade\r\nBickersdyke. With Psmith, the worker, he had no fault to find; but it\r\nseemed to me sometimes, during our festive evenings together at the\r\nclub, that all was not well. From little, almost imperceptible signs I\r\nhave suspected now and then that he would just as soon have been\r\nwithout my company. One cannot explain these things. It must have been\r\nsome incompatibility of temperament. Perhaps he will manage to bear up\r\nat my departure. But here we are,' he added, as the cab drew up. 'I\r\nwonder if Comrade Jackson is still going strong.'\r\n\r\nThey passed through the turnstile, and caught sight of the\r\ntelegraph-board.\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' said Psmith, 'he is. I don't know if he's number three or\r\nnumber six. I expect he's number six. In which case he has got\r\nninety-eight. We're just in time to see his century.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29. And Mike's\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nearly two hours Mike had been experiencing the keenest pleasure\r\nthat it had ever fallen to his lot to feel. From the moment he took his\r\nfirst ball till the luncheon interval he had suffered the acutest\r\ndiscomfort. His nervousness had left him to a great extent, but he had\r\nnever really settled down. Sometimes by luck, and sometimes by skill,\r\nhe had kept the ball out of his wicket; but he was scratching, and he\r\nknew it. Not for a single over had he been comfortable. On several\r\noccasions he had edged balls to leg and through the slips in quite an\r\ninferior manner, and it was seldom that he managed to hit with the\r\ncentre of the bat.\r\n\r\nNobody is more alive to the fact that he is not playing up to his true\r\nform than the batsman. Even though his score mounted little by little\r\ninto the twenties, Mike was miserable. If this was the best he could do\r\non a perfect wicket, he felt there was not much hope for him as a\r\nprofessional.\r\n\r\nThe poorness of his play was accentuated by the brilliance of Joe's.\r\nJoe combined science and vigour to a remarkable degree. He laid on the\r\nwood with a graceful robustness which drew much cheering from the\r\ncrowd. Beside him Mike was oppressed by that leaden sense of moral\r\ninferiority which weighs on a man who has turned up to dinner in\r\nordinary clothes when everybody else has dressed. He felt awkward and\r\nconspicuously out of place.\r\n\r\nThen came lunch--and after lunch a glorious change.\r\n\r\nVolumes might be written on the cricket lunch and the influence it has\r\non the run of the game; how it undoes one man, and sends another back\r\nto the fray like a giant refreshed; how it turns the brilliant fast\r\nbowler into the sluggish medium, and the nervous bat into the masterful\r\nsmiter.\r\n\r\nOn Mike its effect was magical. He lunched wisely and well, chewing his\r\nfood with the concentration of a thirty-three-bites a mouthful crank,\r\nand drinking dry ginger-ale. As he walked out with Joe after the\r\ninterval he knew that a change had taken place in him. His nerve had\r\ncome back, and with it his form.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens at cricket that when one feels particularly fit\r\none gets snapped in the slips in the first over, or clean bowled by a\r\nfull toss; but neither of these things happened to Mike. He stayed in,\r\nand began to score. Now there were no edgings through the slips and\r\nsnicks to leg. He was meeting the ball in the centre of the bat, and\r\nmeeting it vigorously. Two boundaries in successive balls off the fast\r\nbowler, hard, clean drives past extra-cover, put him at peace with all\r\nthe world. He was on top. He had found himself.\r\n\r\nJoe, at the other end, resumed his brilliant career. His century and\r\nMike's fifty arrived in the same over. The bowling began to grow loose.\r\n\r\nJoe, having reached his century, slowed down somewhat, and Mike took up\r\nthe running. The score rose rapidly.\r\n\r\nA leg-theory bowler kept down the pace of the run-getting for a time,\r\nbut the bowlers at the other end continued to give away runs. Mike's\r\nscore passed from sixty to seventy, from seventy to eighty, from eighty\r\nto ninety. When the Smiths, father and son, came on to the ground the\r\ntotal was ninety-eight. Joe had made a hundred and thirty-three.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMike reached his century just as Psmith and his father took their\r\nseats. A square cut off the slow bowler was just too wide for point to\r\nget to. By the time third man had sprinted across and returned the ball\r\nthe batsmen had run two.\r\n\r\nMr Smith was enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n'I tell you,' he said to Psmith, who was clapping in a gently\r\nencouraging manner, 'the boy's a wonderful bat. I said so when he was\r\ndown with us. I remember telling him so myself. \"I've seen your\r\nbrothers play,\" I said, \"and you're better than any of them.\" I\r\nremember it distinctly. He'll be playing for England in another year or\r\ntwo. Fancy putting a cricketer like that into the City! It's a crime.'\r\n\r\n'I gather,' said Psmith, 'that the family coffers had got a bit low. It\r\nwas necessary for Comrade Jackson to do something by way of saving the\r\nOld Home.'\r\n\r\n'He ought to be at the University. Look, he's got that man away to the\r\nboundary again. They'll never get him out.'\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock the partnership was broken, Joe running himself out in\r\ntrying to snatch a single where no single was. He had made a hundred\r\nand eighty-nine.\r\n\r\nMike flung himself down on the turf with mixed feelings. He was sorry\r\nJoe was out, but he was very glad indeed of the chance of a rest. He\r\nwas utterly fagged. A half-day match once a week is no training for\r\nfirst-class cricket. Joe, who had been playing all the season, was as\r\ntough as india-rubber, and trotted into the pavilion as fresh as if he\r\nhad been having a brief spell at the nets. Mike, on the other hand,\r\nfelt that he simply wanted to be dropped into a cold bath and left\r\nthere indefinitely. There was only another half-hour's play, but he\r\ndoubted if he could get through it.\r\n\r\nHe dragged himself up wearily as Joe's successor arrived at the\r\nwickets. He had crossed Joe before the latter's downfall, and it was\r\nhis turn to take the bowling.\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to have gone out of him. He could not time the ball\r\nproperly. The last ball of the over looked like a half-volley, and he\r\nhit out at it. But it was just short of a half-volley, and his stroke\r\narrived too soon. The bowler, running in the direction of mid-on,\r\nbrought off an easy c.-and-b.\r\n\r\nMike turned away towards the pavilion. He heard the gradually swelling\r\napplause in a sort of dream. It seemed to him hours before he reached\r\nthe dressing-room.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting on a chair, wishing that somebody would come along and\r\ntake off his pads, when Psmith's card was brought to him. A few moments\r\nlater the old Etonian appeared in person.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Smith,' said Mike, 'By Jove! I'm done.'\r\n\r\n'\"How Little Willie Saved the Match,\"' said Psmith. 'What you want is\r\none of those gin and ginger-beers we hear so much about. Remove those\r\npads, and let us flit downstairs in search of a couple. Well, Comrade\r\nJackson, you have fought the good fight this day. My father sends his\r\ncompliments. He is dining out, or he would have come up. He is going to\r\nlook in at the flat latish.'\r\n\r\n'How many did I get?' asked Mike. 'I was so jolly done I didn't think\r\nof looking.'\r\n\r\n'A hundred and forty-eight of the best,' said Psmith. 'What will they\r\nsay at the old homestead about this? Are you ready? Then let us test\r\nthis fruity old ginger-beer of theirs.'\r\n\r\nThe two batsmen who had followed the big stand were apparently having a\r\nlittle stand all of their own. No more wickets fell before the drawing\r\nof stumps. Psmith waited for Mike while he changed, and carried him off\r\nin a cab to Simpson's, a restaurant which, as he justly observed,\r\noffered two great advantages, namely, that you need not dress, and,\r\nsecondly, that you paid your half-crown, and were then at liberty to\r\neat till you were helpless, if you felt so disposed, without extra\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nMike stopped short of this giddy height of mastication, but consumed\r\nenough to make him feel a great deal better. Psmith eyed his inroads on\r\nthe menu with approval.\r\n\r\n'There is nothing,' he said, 'like victualling up before an ordeal.'\r\n\r\n'What's the ordeal?' said Mike.\r\n\r\n'I propose to take you round to the club anon, where I trust we shall\r\nfind Comrade Bickersdyke. We have much to say to one another.'\r\n\r\n'Look here, I'm hanged--' began Mike.\r\n\r\n'Yes, you must be there,' said Psmith. 'Your presence will serve to\r\ncheer Comrade B. up. Fate compels me to deal him a nasty blow, and he\r\nwill want sympathy. I have got to break it to him that I am leaving the\r\nbank.'\r\n\r\n'What, are you going to chuck it?'\r\n\r\nPsmith inclined his head.\r\n\r\n'The time,' he said, 'has come to part. It has served its turn. The\r\nstartled whisper runs round the City. \"Psmith has had sufficient.\"'\r\n\r\n'What are you going to do?'\r\n\r\n'I propose to enter the University of Cambridge, and there to study the\r\nintricacies of the Law, with a view to having a subsequent dash at\r\nbecoming Lord Chancellor.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' said Mike, 'you're lucky. I wish I were coming too.'\r\n\r\nPsmith knocked the ash off his cigarette.\r\n\r\n'Are you absolutely set on becoming a pro?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'It depends on what you call set. It seems to me it's about all I can\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n'I can offer you a not entirely scaly job,' said Smith, 'if you feel\r\nlike taking it. In the course of conversation with my father during the\r\nmatch this afternoon, I gleaned the fact that he is anxious to secure\r\nyour services as a species of agent. The vast Psmith estates, it seems,\r\nneed a bright boy to keep an eye upon them. Are you prepared to accept\r\nthe post?'\r\n\r\nMike stared.\r\n\r\n'Me! Dash it all, how old do you think I am? I'm only nineteen.'\r\n\r\n'I had suspected as much from the alabaster clearness of your\r\nunwrinkled brow. But my father does not wish you to enter upon your\r\nduties immediately. There would be a preliminary interval of three,\r\npossibly four, years at Cambridge, during which I presume, you would be\r\nlearning divers facts concerning spuds, turmuts, and the like. At\r\nleast,' said Psmith airily, 'I suppose so. Far be it from me to dictate\r\nthe line of your researches.'\r\n\r\n'Then I'm afraid it's off,' said Mike gloomily. 'My pater couldn't\r\nafford to send me to Cambridge.'\r\n\r\n'That obstacle,' said Psmith, 'can be surmounted. You would, of course,\r\naccompany me to Cambridge, in the capacity, which you enjoy at the\r\npresent moment, of my confidential secretary and adviser. Any expenses\r\nthat might crop up would be defrayed from the Psmith family chest.'\r\n\r\nMike's eyes opened wide again.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean,' he asked bluntly, 'that your pater would pay for me at\r\nthe 'Varsity? No I say--dash it--I mean, I couldn't--'\r\n\r\n'Do you suggest,' said Psmith, raising his eyebrows, 'that I should go\r\nto the University _without_ a confidential secretary and adviser?'\r\n\r\n'No, but I mean--' protested Mike.\r\n\r\n'Then that's settled,' said Psmith. 'I knew you would not desert me in\r\nmy hour of need, Comrade Jackson. \"What will you do,\" asked my father,\r\nalarmed for my safety, \"among these wild undergraduates? I fear for my\r\nRupert.\" \"Have no fear, father,\" I replied. \"Comrade Jackson will be\r\nbeside me.\" His face brightened immediately. \"Comrade Jackson,\" he\r\nsaid, \"is a man in whom I have the supremest confidence. If he is with\r\nyou I shall sleep easy of nights.\" It was after that that the\r\nconversation drifted to the subject of agents.'\r\n\r\nPsmith called for the bill and paid it in the affable manner of a\r\nmonarch signing a charter. Mike sat silent, his mind in a whirl. He saw\r\nexactly what had happened. He could almost hear Psmith talking his\r\nfather into agreeing with his scheme. He could think of nothing to say.\r\nAs usually happened in any emotional crisis in his life, words\r\nabsolutely deserted him. The thing was too big. Anything he could say\r\nwould sound too feeble. When a friend has solved all your difficulties\r\nand smoothed out all the rough places which were looming in your path,\r\nyou cannot thank him as if he had asked you to lunch. The occasion\r\ndemanded some neat, polished speech; and neat, polished speeches were\r\nbeyond Mike.\r\n\r\n'I say, Psmith--' he began.\r\n\r\nPsmith rose.\r\n\r\n'Let us now,' he said, 'collect our hats and meander to the club,\r\nwhere, I have no doubt, we shall find Comrade Bickersdyke, all\r\nunconscious of impending misfortune, dreaming pleasantly over coffee\r\nand a cigar in the lower smoking-room.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30. The Last Sad Farewells\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it happened, that was precisely what Mr Bickersdyke was doing. He\r\nwas feeling thoroughly pleased with life. For nearly nine months Psmith\r\nhad been to him a sort of spectre at the feast inspiring him with an\r\never-present feeling of discomfort which he had found impossible to\r\nshake off. And tonight he saw his way of getting rid of him.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes past four Mr Gregory, crimson and wrathful, had plunged\r\ninto his room with a long statement of how Psmith, deputed to help in\r\nthe life and thought of the Fixed Deposits Department, had left the\r\nbuilding at four o'clock, when there was still another hour and a\r\nhalf's work to be done.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Mr Gregory deposed, the errant one, seen sliding out of the\r\nswinging door, and summoned in a loud, clear voice to come back, had\r\nflatly disobeyed and had gone upon his ways 'Grinning at me,' said the\r\naggrieved Mr Gregory, 'like a dashed ape.' A most unjust description of\r\nthe sad, sweet smile which Psmith had bestowed upon him from the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nEver since that moment Mr Bickersdyke had felt that there was a silver\r\nlining to the cloud. Hitherto Psmith had left nothing to be desired in\r\nthe manner in which he performed his work. His righteousness in the\r\noffice had clothed him as in a suit of mail. But now he had slipped. To\r\ngo off an hour and a half before the proper time, and to refuse to\r\nreturn when summoned by the head of his department--these were offences\r\nfor which he could be dismissed without fuss. Mr Bickersdyke looked\r\nforward to tomorrow's interview with his employee.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, having enjoyed an excellent dinner, he was now, as Psmith\r\nhad predicted, engaged with a cigar and a cup of coffee in the lower\r\nsmoking-room of the Senior Conservative Club.\r\n\r\nPsmith and Mike entered the room when he was about half through these\r\nluxuries.\r\n\r\nPsmith's first action was to summon a waiter, and order a glass of neat\r\nbrandy. 'Not for myself,' he explained to Mike. 'For Comrade\r\nBickersdyke. He is about to sustain a nasty shock, and may need a\r\nrestorative at a moment's notice. For all we know, his heart may not be\r\nstrong. In any case, it is safest to have a pick-me-up handy.'\r\n\r\nHe paid the waiter, and advanced across the room, followed by Mike. In\r\nhis hand, extended at arm's length, he bore the glass of brandy.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke caught sight of the procession, and started. Psmith set\r\nthe brandy down very carefully on the table, beside the manager's\r\ncoffee cup, and, dropping into a chair, regarded him pityingly through\r\nhis eyeglass. Mike, who felt embarrassed, took a seat some little way\r\nbehind his companion. This was Psmith's affair, and he proposed to\r\nallow him to do the talking.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke, except for a slight deepening of the colour of his\r\ncomplexion, gave no sign of having seen them. He puffed away at his\r\ncigar, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\r\n\r\n'An unpleasant task lies before us,' began Psmith in a low, sorrowful\r\nvoice, 'and it must not be shirked. Have I your ear, Mr Bickersdyke?'\r\n\r\nAddressed thus directly, the manager allowed his gaze to wander from\r\nthe ceiling. He eyed Psmith for a moment like an elderly basilisk, then\r\nlooked back at the ceiling again.\r\n\r\n'I shall speak to you tomorrow,' he said.\r\n\r\nPsmith heaved a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n'You will not see us tomorrow,' he said, pushing the brandy a little\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke's eyes left the ceiling once more.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Drink this,' urged Psmith sympathetically, holding out the glass. 'Be\r\nbrave,' he went on rapidly. 'Time softens the harshest blows. Shocks\r\nstun us for the moment, but we recover. Little by little we come to\r\nourselves again. Life, which we had thought could hold no more pleasure\r\nfor us, gradually shows itself not wholly grey.'\r\n\r\nMr Bickersdyke seemed about to make an observation at this point, but\r\nPsmith, with a wave of the hand, hurried on.\r\n\r\n'We find that the sun still shines, the birds still sing. Things which\r\nused to entertain us resume their attraction. Gradually we emerge from\r\nthe soup, and begin--'\r\n\r\n'If you have anything to say to me,' said the manager, 'I should be\r\nglad if you would say it, and go.'\r\n\r\n'You prefer me not to break the bad news gently?' said Psmith. 'Perhaps\r\nyou are wise. In a word, then,'--he picked up the brandy and held it\r\nout to him--'Comrade Jackson and myself are leaving the bank.'\r\n\r\n'I am aware of that,' said Mr Bickersdyke drily.\r\n\r\nPsmith put down the glass.\r\n\r\n'You have been told already?' he said. 'That accounts for your calm.\r\nThe shock has expended its force on you, and can do no more. You are\r\nstunned. I am sorry, but it had to be. You will say that it is madness\r\nfor us to offer our resignations, that our grip on the work of the bank\r\nmade a prosperous career in Commerce certain for us. It may be so. But\r\nsomehow we feel that our talents lie elsewhere. To Comrade Jackson the\r\nmanagement of the Psmith estates seems the job on which he can get the\r\nrapid half-Nelson. For my own part, I feel that my long suit is the\r\nBar. I am a poor, unready speaker, but I intend to acquire a knowledge\r\nof the Law which shall outweigh this defect. Before leaving you, I\r\nshould like to say--I may speak for you as well as myself, Comrade\r\nJackson--?'\r\n\r\nMike uttered his first contribution to the conversation--a gurgle--and\r\nrelapsed into silence again.\r\n\r\n'I should like to say,' continued Psmith, 'how much Comrade Jackson and\r\nI have enjoyed our stay in the bank. The insight it has given us into\r\nyour masterly handling of the intricate mechanism of the office has\r\nbeen a treat we would not have missed. But our place is elsewhere.'\r\n\r\nHe rose. Mike followed his example with alacrity. It occurred to Mr\r\nBickersdyke, as they turned to go, that he had not yet been able to get\r\nin a word about their dismissal. They were drifting away with all the\r\nhonours of war.\r\n\r\n'Come back,' he cried.\r\n\r\nPsmith paused and shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n'This is unmanly, Comrade Bickersdyke,' he said. 'I had not expected\r\nthis. That you should be dazed by the shock was natural. But that you\r\nshould beg us to reconsider our resolve and return to the bank is\r\nunworthy of you. Be a man. Bite the bullet. The first keen pang will\r\npass. Time will soften the feeling of bereavement. You must be brave.\r\nCome, Comrade Jackson.'\r\n\r\nMike responded to the call without hesitation.\r\n\r\n'We will now,' said Psmith, leading the way to the door, 'push back to\r\nthe flat. My father will be round there soon.' He looked over his\r\nshoulder. Mr Bickersdyke appeared to be wrapped in thought.\r\n\r\n'A painful business,' sighed Psmith. 'The man seems quite broken up. It\r\nhad to be, however. The bank was no place for us. An excellent career\r\nin many respects, but unsuitable for you and me. It is hard on Comrade\r\nBickersdyke, especially as he took such trouble to get me into it, but\r\nI think we may say that we are well out of the place.'\r\n\r\nMike's mind roamed into the future. Cambridge first, and then an\r\nopen-air life of the sort he had always dreamed of. The Problem of\r\nLife seemed to him to be solved. He looked on down the years, and he\r\ncould see no troubles there of any kind whatsoever. Reason suggested\r\nthat there were probably one or two knocking about somewhere, but this\r\nwas no time to think of them. He examined the future, and found it good.\r\n\r\n'I should jolly well think,' he said simply, 'that we might.'"
