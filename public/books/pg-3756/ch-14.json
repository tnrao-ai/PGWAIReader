    "It wasn’t Archie’s fault really. Its true he went to America and fell\r\nin love with Lucille, the daughter of a millionaire hotel proprietor\r\nand if he did marry her—well, what else was there to do?\r\n\r\nFrom his point of view, the whole thing was a thoroughly good egg; but\r\nMr. Brewster, his father-in-law, thought differently, Archie had\r\nneither money nor occupation, which was distasteful in the eyes of the\r\nindustrious Mr. Brewster; but the real bar was the fact that he had\r\nonce adversely criticised one of his hotels.\r\n\r\nArchie does his best to heal the breach; but, being something of an\r\nass, genus priceless, he finds it almost beyond his powers to placate\r\n“the man-eating fish” whom Providence has given him as a father-in-law\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.

W. KING-HALL\r\n\r\nMy dear Buddy,—\r\n\r\nWe have been friends for eighteen years. A considerable proportion of\r\nmy books were written under your hospitable roof. And yet I have never\r\ndedicated one to you. What will be the verdict of Posterity on this?\r\nThe fact is, I have become rather superstitious about dedications. No\r\nsooner do you label a book with the legend—\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY\r\nBEST FRIEND\r\nX\r\n\r\nthan X cuts you in Piccadilly, or you bring a lawsuit against him.\r\nThere is a fatality about it. However, I can’t imagine anyone\r\nquarrelling with you, and I am getting more attractive all the time, so\r\nlet’s take a chance.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\nP. G. WODEHOUSE."
