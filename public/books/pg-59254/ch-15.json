    "THE PURITY OF THE TURF\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that, life at Twing jogged along pretty peacefully for a bit.\r\nTwing is one of those places where there isn’t a frightful lot to do\r\nnor any very hectic excitement to look forward to. In fact, the only\r\nevent of any importance on the horizon, as far as I could ascertain,\r\nwas the annual village school treat. One simply filled in the time by\r\nloafing about the grounds, playing a bit of tennis, and avoiding young\r\nBingo as far as was humanly possible.\r\n\r\nThis last was a very necessary move if you wanted a happy life, for the\r\nCynthia affair had jarred the unfortunate mutt to such an extent that\r\nhe was always waylaying one and decanting his anguished soul. And when,\r\none morning, he blew into my bedroom while I was toying with a bit of\r\nbreakfast, I decided to take a firm line from the start. I could stand\r\nhaving him moaning all over me after dinner, and even after lunch; but\r\nat breakfast, no. We Woosters are amiability itself, but there is a\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n“Now look here, old friend,” I said. “I know your bally heart is broken\r\nand all that, and at some future time I shall be delighted to hear all\r\nabout it, but----”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t come to talk about that.”\r\n\r\n“No? Good egg!”\r\n\r\n“The past,” said young Bingo, “is dead. Let us say no more about it.”\r\n\r\n“Right-o!”\r\n\r\n“I have been wounded to the very depths of my soul, but don’t speak\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t.”\r\n\r\n“Ignore it. Forget it.”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely!”\r\n\r\nI hadn’t seen him so dashed reasonable for days.\r\n\r\n“What I came to see you about this morning, Bertie,” he said, fishing a\r\nsheet of paper out of his pocket, “was to ask if you would care to come\r\nin on another little flutter.”\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing we Woosters are simply dripping with, it is\r\nsporting blood. I bolted the rest of my sausage, and sat up and took\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” I said. “You interest me strangely, old bird.”\r\n\r\nBingo laid the paper on the bed.\r\n\r\n“On Monday week,” he said, “you may or may not know, the annual village\r\nschool treat takes place. Lord Wickhammersley lends the Hall grounds\r\nfor the purpose. There will be games, and a conjurer, and cokernut\r\nshies, and tea in a tent. And also sports.”\r\n\r\n“I know. Cynthia was telling me.”\r\n\r\nYoung Bingo winced.\r\n\r\n“Would you mind not mentioning that name? I am not made of marble.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry!”\r\n\r\n“Well, as I was saying, this jamboree is slated for Monday week. The\r\nquestion is, Are we on?”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean, ‘Are we on’?”\r\n\r\n“I am referring to the sports. Steggles did so well out of the Sermon\r\nHandicap that he has decided to make a book on these sports. Punters\r\ncan be accommodated at ante-post odds or starting price, according to\r\ntheir preference. I think we ought to look into it,” said young Bingo.\r\n\r\nI pressed the bell.\r\n\r\n“I’ll consult Jeeves. I don’t touch any sporting proposition without\r\nhis advice. Jeeves,” I said, as he drifted in, “rally round.”\r\n\r\n“Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Stand by. We want your advice.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir.”\r\n\r\n“State your case, Bingo.”\r\n\r\nBingo stated his case.\r\n\r\n“What about it, Jeeves?” I said. “Do we go in?”\r\n\r\nJeeves pondered to some extent.\r\n\r\n“I am inclined to favour the idea, sir.”\r\n\r\nThat was good enough for me. “Right,” I said. “Then we will form a\r\nsyndicate and bust the Ring. I supply the money, you supply the brains,\r\nand Bingo--what do you supply, Bingo?”\r\n\r\n“If you will carry me, and let me settle up later,” said young Bingo,\r\n“I think I can put you in the way of winning a parcel on the Mothers’\r\nSack Race.”\r\n\r\n“All right. We will put you down as Inside Information. Now, what are\r\nthe events?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBingo reached for his paper and consulted it.\r\n\r\n“Girls’ Under Fourteen Fifty-Yard Dash seems to open the proceedings.”\r\n\r\n“Anything to say about that, Jeeves?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. I have no information.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the next?”\r\n\r\n“Boys’ and Girls’ Mixed Animal Potato Race, All Ages.”\r\n\r\nThis was a new one to me. I had never heard of it at any of the big\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Rather sporting,” said young Bingo. “The competitors enter in couples,\r\neach couple being assigned an animal cry and a potato. For instance,\r\nlet’s suppose that you and Jeeves entered. Jeeves would stand at a\r\nfixed point holding a potato. You would have your head in a sack, and\r\nyou would grope about trying to find Jeeves and making a noise like a\r\ncat; Jeeves also making a noise like a cat. Other competitors would be\r\nmaking noises like cows and pigs and dogs, and so on, and groping about\r\nfor _their_ potato-holders, who would also be making noises like cows\r\nand pigs and dogs and so on----”\r\n\r\nI stopped the poor fish.\r\n\r\n“Jolly if you’re fond of animals,” I said, “but on the whole----”\r\n\r\n“Precisely, sir,” said Jeeves. “I wouldn’t touch it.”\r\n\r\n“Too open, what?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, sir. Very hard to estimate form.”\r\n\r\n“Carry on, Bingo. Where do we go from there?”\r\n\r\n“Mothers’ Sack Race.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that’s better. This is where you know something.”\r\n\r\n“A gift for Mrs. Penworthy, the tobacconist’s wife,” said Bingo\r\nconfidently. “I was in at her shop yesterday, buying cigarettes, and\r\nshe told me she had won three times at fairs in Worcestershire. She\r\nonly moved to these parts a short time ago, so nobody knows about her.\r\nShe promised me she would keep herself dark, and I think we could get a\r\ngood price.”\r\n\r\n“Risk a tenner each way, Jeeves, what?”\r\n\r\n“I think so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Girls’ Open Egg and Spoon Race,” read Bingo.\r\n\r\n“How about that?”\r\n\r\n“I doubt if it would be worth while to invest, sir,” said Jeeves. “I am\r\ntold it is a certainty for last year’s winner, Sarah Mills, who will\r\ndoubtless start an odds-on favourite.”\r\n\r\n“Good, is she?”\r\n\r\n“They tell me in the village that she carries a beautiful egg, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then there’s the Obstacle Race,” said Bingo. “Risky, in my\r\nopinion. Like betting on the Grand National. Fathers’ Hat-Trimming\r\nContest--another speculative event. That’s all, except for the Choir\r\nBoys’ Hundred Yards Handicap, for a pewter mug presented by the\r\nvicar--open to all whose voices have not broken before the second\r\nSunday in Epiphany. Willie Chambers won last year, in a canter,\r\nreceiving fifteen yards. This time he will probably be handicapped out\r\nof the race. I don’t know what to advise.”\r\n\r\n“If I might make a suggestion, sir.”\r\n\r\nI eyed Jeeves with interest. I don’t know that I’d ever seen him look\r\nso nearly excited.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got something up your sleeve?”\r\n\r\n“I have, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Red-hot?”\r\n\r\n“That precisely describes it, sir. I think I may confidently assert\r\nthat we have the winner of the Choir Boys’ Handicap under this very\r\nroof, sir. Harold, the page-boy.”\r\n\r\n“Page-boy? Do you mean the tubby little chap in buttons one sees\r\nbobbing about here and there? Why, dash it, Jeeves, nobody has a\r\ngreater respect for your knowledge of form than I have, but I’m\r\nhanged if I can see Harold catching the judge’s eye. He’s practically\r\ncircular, and every time I’ve seen him he’s been leaning up against\r\nsomething, half asleep.”\r\n\r\n“He receives thirty yards, sir, and could win from scratch. The boy is\r\na flier.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\nJeeves coughed, and there was a dreamy look in his eye.\r\n\r\n“I was as much astonished as yourself, sir, when I first became aware\r\nof the lad’s capabilities. I happened to pursue him one morning with\r\nthe intention of fetching him a clip on the side of the head----”\r\n\r\n“Great Scott, Jeeves! You!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. The boy is of an outspoken disposition, and had made an\r\nopprobrious remark respecting my personal appearance.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say about your appearance?”\r\n\r\n“I have forgotten, sir,” said Jeeves, with a touch of austerity. “But\r\nit was opprobrious. I endeavoured to correct him, but he outdistanced\r\nme by yards and made good his escape.”\r\n\r\n“But, I say, Jeeves, this is sensational. And yet--if he’s such a\r\nsprinter, why hasn’t anybody in the village found it out? Surely he\r\nplays with the other boys?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. As his lordship’s page-boy, Harold does not mix with the\r\nvillage lads.”\r\n\r\n“Bit of a snob, what?”\r\n\r\n“He is somewhat acutely alive to the existence of class distinctions,\r\nsir.”\r\n\r\n“You’re absolutely certain he’s such a wonder?” said Bingo. “I mean, it\r\nwouldn’t do to plunge unless you’re sure.”\r\n\r\n“If you desire to ascertain the boy’s form by personal inspection, sir,\r\nit will be a simple matter to arrange a secret trial.”\r\n\r\n“I’m bound to say I should feel easier in my mind,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Then if I may take a shilling from the money on your\r\ndressing-table----”\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\n“I propose to bribe the lad to speak slightingly of the second\r\nfootman’s squint, sir. Charles is somewhat sensitive on the point,\r\nand should undoubtedly make the lad extend himself. If you will be at\r\nthe first-floor passage-window, overlooking the back-door, in half an\r\nhour’s time----”\r\n\r\nI don’t know when I’ve dressed in such a hurry. As a rule, I’m what\r\nyou might call a slow and careful dresser: I like to linger over the\r\ntie and see that the trousers are just so; but this morning I was all\r\nworked up. I just shoved on my things anyhow, and joined Bingo at the\r\nwindow with a quarter of an hour to spare.\r\n\r\nThe passage-window looked down on to a broad sort of paved courtyard,\r\nwhich ended after about twenty yards in an archway through a high wall.\r\nBeyond this archway you got on to a strip of the drive, which curved\r\nround for another thirty yards or so, till it was lost behind a thick\r\nshrubbery. I put myself in the stripling’s place and thought what steps\r\nI would take with a second footman after me. There was only one thing\r\nto do--leg it for the shrubbery and take cover; which meant that at\r\nleast fifty yards would have to be covered--an excellent test. If good\r\nold Harold could fight off the second footman’s challenge long enough\r\nto allow him to reach the bushes, there wasn’t a choirboy in England\r\nwho could give him thirty yards in the hundred. I waited, all of a\r\ntwitter, for what seemed hours, and then suddenly there was a confused\r\nnoise without, and something round and blue and buttony shot through\r\nthe back-door and buzzed for the archway like a mustang. And about two\r\nseconds later out came the second footman, going his hardest.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to it. Absolutely nothing. The field never had a\r\nchance. Long before the footman reached the half-way mark, Harold was\r\nin the bushes, throwing stones. I came away from the window thrilled to\r\nthe marrow; and when I met Jeeves on the stairs I was so moved that I\r\nnearly grasped his hand.\r\n\r\n“Jeeves,” I said, “no discussion! The Wooster shirt goes on this boy!”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” said Jeeves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe worst of these country meetings is that you can’t plunge as heavily\r\nas you would like when you get a good thing, because it alarms the\r\nRing. Steggles, though pimpled, was, as I have indicated, no chump,\r\nand if I had invested all I wanted to he would have put two and two\r\ntogether. I managed to get a good solid bet down for the syndicate,\r\nhowever, though it did make him look thoughtful. I heard in the next\r\nfew days that he had been making searching inquiries in the village\r\nconcerning Harold; but nobody could tell him anything, and eventually\r\nhe came to the conclusion, I suppose, that I must be having a long\r\nshot on the strength of that thirty-yards start. Public opinion\r\nwavered between Jimmy Goode, receiving ten yards, at seven-to-two, and\r\nAlexander Bartlett, with six yards start, at eleven-to-four. Willie\r\nChambers, scratch, was offered to the public at two-to-one, but found\r\nno takers.\r\n\r\nWe were taking no chances on the big event, and directly we had got\r\nour money on at a nice hundred-to-twelve Harold was put into strict\r\ntraining. It was a wearing business, and I can understand now why most\r\nof the big trainers are grim, silent men, who look as though they had\r\nsuffered. The kid wanted constant watching. It was no good talking to\r\nhim about honour and glory and how proud his mother would be when he\r\nwrote and told her he had won a real cup--the moment blighted Harold\r\ndiscovered that training meant knocking off pastry, taking exercise,\r\nand keeping away from the cigarettes, he was all against it, and it was\r\nonly by unceasing vigilance that we managed to keep him in any shape at\r\nall. It was the diet that was the stumbling-block. As far as exercise\r\nwent, we could generally arrange for a sharp dash every morning with\r\nthe assistance of the second footman. It ran into money, of course, but\r\nthat couldn’t be helped. Still, when a kid has simply to wait till the\r\nbutler’s back is turned to have the run of the pantry, and has only to\r\nnip into the smoking-room to collect a handful of the best Turkish,\r\ntraining becomes a rocky job. We could only hope that on the day his\r\nnatural stamina would pull him through.\r\n\r\nAnd then one evening young Bingo came back from the links with a\r\ndisturbing story. He had been in the habit of giving Harold mild\r\nexercise in the afternoons by taking him out as a caddie.\r\n\r\nAt first he seemed to think it humorous, the poor chump! He bubbled\r\nover with merry mirth as he began his tale.\r\n\r\n“I say, rather funny this afternoon,” he said. “You ought to have seen\r\nSteggles’s face!”\r\n\r\n“Seen Steggles’s face? What for?”\r\n\r\n“When he saw young Harold sprint, I mean.”\r\n\r\nI was filled with a grim foreboding of an awful doom.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! You didn’t let Harold sprint in front of Steggles?”\r\n\r\nYoung Bingo’s jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n“I never thought of that,” he said, gloomily. “It wasn’t my fault. I\r\nwas playing a round with Steggles, and after we’d finished we went into\r\nthe club-house for a drink, leaving Harold with the clubs outside. In\r\nabout five minutes we came out, and there was the kid on the gravel\r\npractising swings with Steggles’s driver and a stone. When he saw\r\nus coming, the kid dropped the club and was over the horizon like a\r\nstreak. Steggles was absolutely dumbfounded. And I must say it was a\r\nrevelation even to me. The kid certainly gave of his best. Of course,\r\nit’s a nuisance in a way; but I don’t see, on second thoughts,” said\r\nBingo, brightening up, “what it matters. We’re on at a good price.\r\nWe’ve nothing to lose by the kid’s form becoming known. I take it he\r\nwill start odds-on, but that doesn’t affect us.”\r\n\r\nI looked at Jeeves. Jeeves looked at me.\r\n\r\n“It affects us all right if he doesn’t start at all.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely, sir.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Bingo.\r\n\r\n“If you ask me,” I said, “I think Steggles will try to nobble him\r\nbefore the race.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! I never thought of that.” Bingo blenched. “You don’t think\r\nhe would really do it?”\r\n\r\n“I think he would have a jolly good try. Steggles is a bad man. From\r\nnow on, Jeeves, we must watch Harold like hawks.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Ceaseless vigilance, what?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t care to sleep in his room, Jeeves?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I should not.”\r\n\r\n“No, nor would I, if it comes to that. But dash it all,” I said, “we’re\r\nletting ourselves get rattled! We’re losing our nerve. This won’t do.\r\nHow can Steggles possibly get at Harold, even if he wants to?”\r\n\r\nThere was no cheering young Bingo up. He’s one of those birds who\r\nsimply leap at the morbid view, if you give them half a chance.\r\n\r\n“There are all sorts of ways of nobbling favourites,” he said, in\r\na sort of death-bed voice. “You ought to read some of these racing\r\nnovels. In ‘Pipped on the Post,’ Lord Jasper Mauleverer as near as a\r\ntoucher outed Bonny Betsy by bribing the head lad to slip a cobra into\r\nher stable the night before the Derby!”\r\n\r\n“What are the chances of a cobra biting Harold, Jeeves?”\r\n\r\n“Slight, I should imagine, sir. And in such an event, knowing the boy\r\nas intimately as I do, my anxiety would be entirely for the snake.”\r\n\r\n“Still, unceasing vigilance, Jeeves.”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly, sir.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must say I got a bit fed with young Bingo in the next few days. It’s\r\nall very well for a fellow with a big winner in his stable to exercise\r\nproper care, but in my opinion Bingo overdid it. The blighter’s mind\r\nappeared to be absolutely saturated with racing fiction; and in stories\r\nof that kind, as far as I could make out, no horse is ever allowed to\r\nstart in a race without at least a dozen attempts to put it out of\r\naction. He stuck to Harold like a plaster. Never let the unfortunate\r\nkid out of his sight. Of course, it meant a lot to the poor old egg if\r\nhe could collect on this race, because it would give him enough money\r\nto chuck his tutoring job and get back to London; but all the same, he\r\nneedn’t have woken me up at three in the morning twice running--once to\r\ntell me we ought to cook Harold’s food ourselves to prevent doping: the\r\nother time to say that he had heard mysterious noises in the shrubbery.\r\nBut he reached the limit, in my opinion, when he insisted on my going\r\nto evening service on Sunday, the day before the sports.\r\n\r\n“Why on earth?” I said, never being much of a lad for evensong.\r\n\r\n“Well, I can’t go myself. I shan’t be here. I’ve got to go to London\r\nto-day with young Egbert.” Egbert was Lord Wickhammersley’s son, the\r\none Bingo was tutoring. “He’s going for a visit down in Kent, and I’ve\r\ngot to see him off at Charing Cross. It’s an infernal nuisance. I\r\nshan’t be back till Monday afternoon. In fact, I shall miss most of the\r\nsports, I expect. Everything, therefore, depends on you, Bertie.”\r\n\r\n“But why should either of us go to evening service?”\r\n\r\n“Ass! Harold sings in the choir, doesn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“What about it? I can’t stop him dislocating his neck over a high note,\r\nif that’s what you’re afraid of.”\r\n\r\n“Fool! Steggles sings in the choir, too. There may be dirty work after\r\nthe service.”\r\n\r\n“What absolute rot!”\r\n\r\n“Is it?” said young Bingo. “Well, let me tell you that in ‘Jenny,\r\nthe Girl Jockey,’ the villain kidnapped the boy who was to ride the\r\nfavourite the night before the big race, and he was the only one who\r\nunderstood and could control the horse, and if the heroine hadn’t\r\ndressed up in riding things and----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right, all right. But, if there’s any danger, it seems to\r\nme the simplest thing would be for Harold not to turn out on Sunday\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\n“He must turn out. You seem to think the infernal kid is a monument of\r\nrectitude, beloved by all. He’s got the shakiest reputation of any kid\r\nin the village. His name is as near being mud as it can jolly well\r\nstick. He’s played hookey from the choir so often that the vicar told\r\nhim, if one more thing happened, he would fire him out. Nice chumps we\r\nshould look if he was scratched the night before the race!”\r\n\r\nWell, of course, that being so, there was nothing for it but to toddle\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s something about evening service in a country church that\r\nmakes a fellow feel drowsy and peaceful. Sort of end-of-a-perfect-day\r\nfeeling. Old Heppenstall was up in the pulpit, and he has a kind of\r\nregular, bleating delivery that assists thought. They had left the door\r\nopen, and the air was full of a mixed scent of trees and honeysuckle\r\nand mildew and villagers’ Sunday clothes. As far as the eye could\r\nreach, you could see farmers propped up in restful attitudes, breathing\r\nheavily; and the children in the congregation who had fidgeted during\r\nthe earlier part of the proceedings were now lying back in a surfeited\r\nsort of coma. The last rays of the setting sun shone through the\r\nstained-glass windows, birds were twittering in the trees, the women’s\r\ndresses crackled gently in the stillness. Peaceful. That’s what I’m\r\ndriving at. I felt peaceful. Everybody felt peaceful. And that is why\r\nthe explosion, when it came, sounded like the end of all things.\r\n\r\nI call it an explosion, because that was what it seemed like when it\r\nbroke loose. One moment a dreamy hush was all over the place, broken\r\nonly by old Heppenstall talking about our duty to our neighbours; and\r\nthen, suddenly, a sort of piercing, shrieking squeal that got you right\r\nbetween the eyes and ran all the way down your spine and out at the\r\nsoles of the feet.\r\n\r\n“EE-ee-ee-ee-ee! Oo-ee! Ee-ee-ee-ee!”\r\n\r\nIt sounded like about six hundred pigs having their tails twisted\r\nsimultaneously, but it was simply the kid Harold, who appeared to be\r\nhaving some species of fit. He was jumping up and down and slapping at\r\nthe back of his neck. And about every other second he would take a deep\r\nbreath and give out another of the squeals.\r\n\r\nWell, I mean, you can’t do that sort of thing in the middle of the\r\nsermon during evening service without exciting remark. The congregation\r\ncame out of its trance with a jerk, and climbed on the pews to get a\r\nbetter view. Old Heppenstall stopped in the middle of a sentence and\r\nspun round. And a couple of vergers with great presence of mind bounded\r\nup the aisle like leopards, collected Harold, still squealing, and\r\nmarched him out. They disappeared into the vestry, and I grabbed my hat\r\nand legged it round to the stage-door, full of apprehension and what\r\nnot. I couldn’t think what the deuce could have happened, but somewhere\r\ndimly behind the proceedings there seemed to me to lurk the hand of the\r\nblighter Steggles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the time I got there and managed to get someone to open the door,\r\nwhich was locked, the service seemed to be over. Old Heppenstall was\r\nstanding in the middle of a crowd of choir-boys and vergers and sextons\r\nand what not, putting the wretched Harold through it with no little\r\nvim. I had come in at the tail-end of what must have been a fairly\r\nfruity oration.\r\n\r\n“Wretched boy! How dare you----”\r\n\r\n“I got a sensitive skin!”\r\n\r\n“This is no time to talk about your skin----”\r\n\r\n“Somebody put a beetle down my back!”\r\n\r\n“Absurd!”\r\n\r\n“I felt it wriggling----”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“Sounds pretty thin, doesn’t it?” said someone at my side.\r\n\r\nIt was Steggles, dash him. Clad in a snowy surplice or cassock, or\r\nwhatever they call it, and wearing an expression of grave concern, the\r\nblighter had the cold, cynical crust to look me in the eyeball without\r\na blink.\r\n\r\n“Did you put a beetle down his neck?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Me!” said Steggles. “Me!”\r\n\r\nOld Heppenstall was putting on the black cap.\r\n\r\n“I do not credit a word of your story, wretched boy! I have warned you\r\nbefore, and now the time has come to act. You cease from this moment to\r\nbe a member of my choir. Go, miserable child!”\r\n\r\nSteggles plucked at my sleeve.\r\n\r\n“In that case,” he said, “those bets, you know--I’m afraid you lose\r\nyour money, dear old boy. It’s a pity you didn’t put it on S.P. I\r\nalways think S.P.’s the only safe way.”\r\n\r\nI gave him one look. Not a bit of good, of course.\r\n\r\n“And they talk about the Purity of the Turf!” I said. And I meant it to\r\nsting, by Jove!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJeeves received the news bravely, but I think the man was a bit rattled\r\nbeneath the surface.\r\n\r\n“An ingenious young gentleman, Mr. Steggles, sir.”\r\n\r\n“A bally swindler, you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that would be a more exact description. However, these things\r\nwill happen on the Turf, and it is useless to complain.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I had your sunny disposition, Jeeves!”\r\n\r\nJeeves bowed.\r\n\r\n“We now rely, then, it would seem, sir, almost entirely on Mrs.\r\nPenworthy. Should she justify Mr. Little’s encomiums and show real\r\nclass in the Mothers’ Sack Race, our gains will just balance our\r\nlosses.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but that’s not much consolation when you’ve been looking forward\r\nto a big win.”\r\n\r\n“It is just possible that we may still find ourselves on the right side\r\nof the ledger after all, sir. Before Mr. Little left, I persuaded him\r\nto invest a small sum for the syndicate of which you were kind enough\r\nto make me a member, sir, on the Girls’ Egg and Spoon Race.”\r\n\r\n“On Sarah Mills?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. On a long-priced outsider. Little Prudence Baxter, sir, the\r\nchild of his lordship’s head gardener. Her father assures me she has a\r\nvery steady hand. She is accustomed to bring him his mug of beer from\r\nthe cottage each afternoon, and he informs me she has never spilled a\r\ndrop.”\r\n\r\nWell, that sounded as though young Prudence’s control was good. But how\r\nabout speed? With seasoned performers like Sarah Mills entered, the\r\nthing practically amounted to a classic race, and in these big events\r\nyou must have speed.\r\n\r\n“I am aware that it is what is termed a long shot, sir. Still, I\r\nthought it judicious.”\r\n\r\n“You backed her for a place, too, of course?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. Each way.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose it’s all right. I’ve never known you make a bloomer\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much, sir.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI’m bound to say that, as a general rule, my idea of a large afternoon\r\nwould be to keep as far away from a village school-treat as possible.\r\nA sticky business. But with such grave issues toward, if you know\r\nwhat I mean, I sank my prejudices on this occasion and rolled up. I\r\nfound the proceedings about as scaly as I had expected. It was a warm\r\nday, and the hall grounds were a dense, practically liquid mass of\r\npeasantry. Kids seethed to and fro. One of them, a small girl of sorts,\r\ngrabbed my hand and hung on to it as I clove my way through the jam to\r\nwhere the Mothers’ Sack Race was to finish. We hadn’t been introduced,\r\nbut she seemed to think I would do as well as anyone else to talk to\r\nabout the rag-doll she had won in the Lucky Dip, and she rather spread\r\nherself on the topic.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to call it Gertrude,” she said. “And I shall undress it\r\nevery night and put it to bed, and wake it up in the morning and dress\r\nit, and put it to bed at night, and wake it up next morning and dress\r\nit----”\r\n\r\n“I say, old thing,” I said, “I don’t want to hurry you and all that,\r\nbut you couldn’t condense it a bit, could you? I’m rather anxious to\r\nsee the finish of this race. The Wooster fortunes are by way of hanging\r\non it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to run in a race soon,” she said, shelving the doll for the\r\nnonce and descending to ordinary chit-chat.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” I said. Distrait, if you know what I mean, and trying to peer\r\nthrough the chinks in the crowd. “What race is that?”\r\n\r\n“Egg ’n Spoon.”\r\n\r\n“No, really? Are you Sarah Mills?”\r\n\r\n“Na-ow!” Registering scorn. “I’m Prudence Baxter.”\r\n\r\nNaturally this put our relations on a different footing. I gazed at her\r\nwith considerable interest. One of the stable. I must say she didn’t\r\nlook much of a flier. She was short and round. Bit out of condition, I\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n“I say,” I said, “that being so, you mustn’t dash about in the hot sun\r\nand take the edge off yourself. You must conserve your energies, old\r\nfriend. Sit down here in the shade.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t want to sit down.”\r\n\r\n“Well, take it easy, anyhow.”\r\n\r\nThe kid flitted to another topic like a butterfly hovering from flower\r\nto flower.\r\n\r\n“I’m a good girl,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I bet you are. I hope you’re a good egg-and-spoon racer, too.”\r\n\r\n“Harold’s a bad boy. Harold squealed in church and isn’t allowed to\r\ncome to the treat. I’m glad,” continued this ornament of her sex,\r\nwrinkling her nose virtuously, “because he’s a bad boy. He pulled my\r\nhair Friday. Harold isn’t coming to the treat! Harold isn’t coming to\r\nthe treat! Harold isn’t coming to the treat!” she chanted, making a\r\nregular song of it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t rub it in, my dear old gardener’s daughter,” I pleaded. “You\r\ndon’t know it, but you’ve hit on rather a painful subject.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Wooster, my dear fellow! So you have made friends with this little\r\nlady?”\r\n\r\nIt was old Heppenstall, beaming pretty profusely. Life and soul of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n“I am delighted, my dear Wooster,” he went on, “quite delighted at\r\nthe way you young men are throwing yourselves into the spirit of this\r\nlittle festivity of ours.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! Even Rupert Steggles. I must confess that my opinion of\r\nRupert Steggles has materially altered for the better this afternoon.”\r\n\r\nMine hadn’t. But I didn’t say so.\r\n\r\n“I have always considered Rupert Steggles, between ourselves, a rather\r\nself-centred youth, by no means the kind who would put himself out to\r\nfurther the enjoyment of his fellows. And yet twice within the last\r\nhalf-hour I have observed him escorting Mrs. Penworthy, our worthy\r\ntobacconist’s wife, to the refreshment-tent.”\r\n\r\nI left him standing. I shook off the clutching hand of the Baxter kid\r\nand hared it rapidly to the spot where the Mothers’ Sack Race was just\r\nfinishing. I had a horrid presentiment that there had been more dirty\r\nwork at the cross-roads. The first person I ran into was young Bingo. I\r\ngrabbed him by the arm.\r\n\r\n“Who won?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I didn’t notice.” There was bitterness in the chappie’s\r\nvoice. “It wasn’t Mrs. Penworthy, dash her! Bertie, that hound Steggles\r\nis nothing more nor less than one of our leading snakes. I don’t know\r\nhow he heard about her, but he must have got on to it that she was\r\ndangerous. Do you know what he did? He lured that miserable woman into\r\nthe refreshment-tent five minutes before the race, and brought her out\r\nso weighed down with cake and tea that she blew up in the first twenty\r\nyards. Just rolled over and lay there! Well, thank goodness, we still\r\nhave Harold!”\r\n\r\nI gaped at the poor chump.\r\n\r\n“Harold? Haven’t you heard?”\r\n\r\n“Heard?” Bingo turned a delicate green. “Heard what? I haven’t heard\r\nanything. I only arrived five minutes ago. Came here straight from the\r\nstation. What has happened? Tell me!”\r\n\r\nI slipped him the information. He stared at me for a moment in a\r\nghastly sort of way, then with a hollow groan tottered away and was\r\nlost in the crowd. A nasty knock, poor chap. I didn’t blame him for\r\nbeing upset.\r\n\r\nThey were clearing the decks now for the Egg and Spoon Race, and I\r\nthought I might as well stay where I was and watch the finish. Not that\r\nI had much hope. Young Prudence was a good conversationalist, but she\r\ndidn’t seem to me to be the build for a winner.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could see through the mob, they got off to a good start.\r\nA short, red-haired child was making the running with a freckled\r\nblonde second, and Sarah Mills lying up an easy third. Our nominee was\r\nstraggling along with the field, well behind the leaders. It was not\r\nhard even as early as this to spot the winner. There was a grace, a\r\npractised precision, in the way Sarah Mills held her spoon that told\r\nits own story. She was cutting out a good pace, but her egg didn’t even\r\nwobble. A natural egg-and-spooner, if ever there was one.\r\n\r\nClass will tell. Thirty yards from the tape, the red-haired kid tripped\r\nover her feet and shot her egg on to the turf. The freckled blonde\r\nfought gamely, but she had run herself out half-way down the straight,\r\nand Sarah Mills came past and home on a tight rein by several lengths,\r\na popular winner. The blonde was second. A sniffing female in blue\r\ngingham beat a pie-faced kid in pink for the place-money, and Prudence\r\nBaxter, Jeeves’s long shot, was either fifth or sixth, I couldn’t see\r\nwhich.\r\n\r\nAnd then I was carried along with the crowd to where old Heppenstall\r\nwas going to present the prizes. I found myself standing next to the\r\nman Steggles.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, old chap!” he said, very bright and cheery. “You’ve had a bad\r\nday, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\nI looked at him with silent scorn. Lost on the blighter, of course.\r\n\r\n“It’s not been a good meeting for any of the big punters,” he went on.\r\n“Poor old Bingo Little went down badly over that Egg and Spoon Race.”\r\n\r\nI hadn’t been meaning to chat with the fellow, but I was startled.\r\n\r\n“How do you mean badly?” I said. “We--he only had a small bet on.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you call small. He had thirty quid each way on the\r\nBaxter kid.”\r\n\r\nThe landscape reeled before me.\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Thirty quid at ten to one. I thought he must have heard something, but\r\napparently not. The race went by the form-book all right.”\r\n\r\nI was trying to do sums in my head. I was just in the middle of working\r\nout the syndicate’s losses, when old Heppenstall’s voice came sort of\r\nfaintly to me out of the distance. He had been pretty fatherly and\r\ndebonair when ladling out the prizes for the other events, but now he\r\nhad suddenly grown all pained and grieved. He peered sorrowfully at the\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“With regard to the Girls’ Egg and Spoon Race, which has just\r\nconcluded,” he said, “I have a painful duty to perform. Circumstances\r\nhave arisen which it is impossible to ignore. It is not too much to say\r\nthat I am stunned.”\r\n\r\nHe gave the populace about five seconds to wonder why he was stunned,\r\nthen went on.\r\n\r\n“Three years ago, as you are aware, I was compelled to expunge from\r\nthe list of events at this annual festival the Fathers’ Quarter-Mile,\r\nowing to reports coming to my ears of wagers taken and given on the\r\nresult at the village inn and a strong suspicion that on at least one\r\noccasion the race had actually been sold by the speediest runner. That\r\nunfortunate occurrence shook my faith in human nature, I admit--but\r\nstill there was one event at least which I confidently expected to\r\nremain untainted by the miasma of professionalism. I allude to the\r\nGirls’ Egg and Spoon Race. It seems, alas, that I was too sanguine.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped again, and wrestled with his feelings.\r\n\r\n“I will not weary you with the unpleasant details. I will merely say\r\nthat before the race was run a stranger in our midst, the manservant\r\nof one of the guests at the Hall--I will not specify with more\r\nparticularity--approached several of the competitors and presented each\r\nof them with five shillings on condition that they--er--finished. A\r\nbelated sense of remorse has led him to confess to me what he did, but\r\nit is too late. The evil is accomplished, and retribution must take\r\nits course. It is no time for half-measures. I must be firm. I rule\r\nthat Sarah Mills, Jane Parker, Bessie Clay, and Rosie Jukes, the first\r\nfour to pass the winning-post, have forfeited their amateur status\r\nand are disqualified, and this handsome work-bag, presented by Lord\r\nWickhammersley, goes, in consequence, to Prudence Baxter. Prudence,\r\nstep forward!”"
