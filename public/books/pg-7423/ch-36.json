    "UNPLEASANTNESS IN THE SMALL HOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nJellicoe, that human encyclopaedia, consulted on the probable\r\nmovements of the enemy, deposed that Spiller, retiring at ten, would\r\nmake for Dormitory One in the same passage, where Robinson also had a\r\nbed. The rest of the opposing forces were distributed among other and\r\nmore distant rooms. It was probable, therefore, that Dormitory One\r\nwould be the rendezvous. As to the time when an attack might be\r\nexpected, it was unlikely that it would occur before half-past eleven.\r\nMr. Outwood went the round of the dormitories at eleven.\r\n\r\n“And touching,” said Psmith, “the matter of noise, must this business\r\nbe conducted in a subdued and _sotto voce_ manner, or may we let\r\nourselves go a bit here and there?”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t think old Outwood’s likely to hear you--he sleeps miles\r\naway on the other side of the house. He never hears anything. We often\r\nrag half the night and nothing happens.”\r\n\r\n“This appears to be a thoroughly nice, well-conducted establishment.\r\nWhat would my mother say if she could see her Rupert in the midst of\r\nthese reckless youths!”\r\n\r\n“All the better,” said Mike; “we don’t want anybody butting in and\r\nstopping the show before it’s half started.”\r\n\r\n“Comrade Jackson’s Berserk blood is up--I can hear it sizzling. I\r\nquite agree these things are all very disturbing and painful, but it’s\r\nas well to do them thoroughly when one’s once in for them. Is there\r\nnobody else who might interfere with our gambols?”\r\n\r\n“Barnes might,” said Jellicoe, “only he won’t.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Barnes?”\r\n\r\n“Head of the house--a rotter. He’s in a funk of Stone and Robinson;\r\nthey rag him; he’ll simply sit tight.”\r\n\r\n“Then I think,” said Psmith placidly, “we may look forward to a very\r\npleasant evening. Shall we be moving?”\r\n\r\nMr. Outwood paid his visit at eleven, as predicted by Jellicoe,\r\nbeaming vaguely into the darkness over a candle, and disappeared\r\nagain, closing the door.\r\n\r\n“How about that door?” said Mike. “Shall we leave it open for them?”\r\n\r\n“Not so, but far otherwise. If it’s shut we shall hear them at it when\r\nthey come. Subject to your approval, Comrade Jackson, I have evolved\r\nthe following plan of action. I always ask myself on these occasions,\r\n‘What would Napoleon have done?’ I think Napoleon would have sat in a\r\nchair by his washhand-stand, which is close to the door; he would have\r\nposted you by your washhand-stand, and he would have instructed\r\nComrade Jellicoe, directly he heard the door-handle turned, to give\r\nhis celebrated imitation of a dormitory breathing heavily in its\r\nsleep. He would then----”\r\n\r\n“I tell you what,” said Mike, “how about tying a string at the top of\r\nthe steps?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Napoleon would have done that, too. Hats off to Comrade Jackson,\r\nthe man with the big brain!”\r\n\r\nThe floor of the dormitory was below the level of the door. There were\r\nthree steps leading down to it. Psmith lit a candle and they examined\r\nthe ground. The leg of a wardrobe and the leg of Jellicoe’s bed made\r\nit possible for the string to be fastened in a satisfactory manner\r\nacross the lower step. Psmith surveyed the result with approval.\r\n\r\n“Dashed neat!” he said. “Practically the sunken road which dished the\r\nCuirassiers at Waterloo. I seem to see Comrade Spiller coming one of\r\nthe finest purlers in the world’s history.”\r\n\r\n“If they’ve got a candle----”\r\n\r\n“They won’t have. If they have, stand by with your water-jug and douse\r\nit at once; then they’ll charge forward and all will be well. If they\r\nhave no candle, fling the water at a venture--fire into the brown!\r\nLest we forget, I’ll collar Comrade Jellicoe’s jug now and keep it\r\nhandy. A couple of sheets would also not be amiss--we will enmesh the\r\nenemy!”\r\n\r\n“Right ho!” said Mike.\r\n\r\n“These humane preparations being concluded,” said Psmith, “we will\r\nretire to our posts and wait. Comrade Jellicoe, don’t forget to\r\nbreathe like an asthmatic sheep when you hear the door opened; they\r\nmay wait at the top of the steps, listening.”\r\n\r\n“You _are_ a chap!” said Jellicoe.\r\n\r\nWaiting in the dark for something to happen is always a trying\r\nexperience, especially if, as on this occasion, silence is essential.\r\nMike found his thoughts wandering back to the vigil he had kept with\r\nMr. Wain at Wrykyn on the night when Wyatt had come in through the\r\nwindow and found authority sitting on his bed, waiting for him. Mike\r\nwas tired after his journey, and he had begun to doze when he was\r\njerked back to wakefulness by the stealthy turning of the door-handle;\r\nthe faintest rustle from Psmith’s direction followed, and a slight\r\ngiggle, succeeded by a series of deep breaths, showed that Jellicoe,\r\ntoo, had heard the noise.\r\n\r\nThere was a creaking sound.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch-dark in the dormitory, but Mike could follow the invaders’\r\nmovements as clearly as if it had been broad daylight. They had opened\r\nthe door and were listening. Jellicoe’s breathing grew more asthmatic;\r\nhe was flinging himself into his part with the whole-heartedness of the\r\ntrue artist.\r\n\r\nThe creak was followed by a sound of whispering, then another creak.\r\nThe enemy had advanced to the top step.... Another creak.... The\r\nvanguard had reached the second step.... In another moment----\r\n\r\nCRASH!\r\n\r\nAnd at that point the proceedings may be said to have formally opened.\r\n\r\nA struggling mass bumped against Mike’s shins as he rose from his\r\nchair; he emptied his jug on to this mass, and a yell of anguish\r\nshowed that the contents had got to the right address.\r\n\r\nThen a hand grabbed his ankle and he went down, a million sparks\r\ndancing before his eyes as a fist, flying out at a venture, caught him\r\non the nose.\r\n\r\nMike had not been well-disposed towards the invaders before, but now\r\nhe ran amok, hitting out right and left at random. His right missed,\r\nbut his left went home hard on some portion of somebody’s anatomy. A\r\nkick freed his ankle and he staggered to his feet. At the same moment\r\na sudden increase in the general volume of noise spoke eloquently of\r\ngood work that was being put in by Psmith.\r\n\r\nEven at that crisis, Mike could not help feeling that if a row of this\r\ncalibre did not draw Mr. Outwood from his bed, he must be an unusual\r\nkind of house-master.\r\n\r\nHe plunged forward again with outstretched arms, and stumbled and fell\r\nover one of the on-the-floor section of the opposing force. They\r\nseized each other earnestly and rolled across the room till Mike,\r\ncontriving to secure his adversary’s head, bumped it on the floor with\r\nsuch abandon that, with a muffled yell, the other let go, and for the\r\nsecond time he rose. As he did so he was conscious of a curious\r\nthudding sound that made itself heard through the other assorted\r\nnoises of the battle.\r\n\r\nAll this time the fight had gone on in the blackest darkness, but now\r\na light shone on the proceedings. Interested occupants of other\r\ndormitories, roused from their slumbers, had come to observe the\r\nsport. They were crowding in the doorway with a candle.\r\n\r\nBy the light of this Mike got a swift view of the theatre of war. The\r\nenemy appeared to number five. The warrior whose head Mike had bumped\r\non the floor was Robinson, who was sitting up feeling his skull in a\r\ngingerly fashion. To Mike’s right, almost touching him, was Stone. In\r\nthe direction of the door, Psmith, wielding in his right hand the cord\r\nof a dressing-gown, was engaging the remaining three with a patient\r\nsmile. They were clad in pyjamas, and appeared to be feeling the\r\ndressing-gown cord acutely.\r\n\r\nThe sudden light dazed both sides momentarily. The defence was the\r\nfirst to recover, Mike, with a swing, upsetting Stone, and Psmith,\r\nhaving seized and emptied Jellicoe’s jug over Spiller, getting to work\r\nagain with the cord in a manner that roused the utmost enthusiasm of\r\nthe spectators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PSMITH SEIZED AND EMPTIED JELLICOE’S JUG OVER SPILLER]\r\n\r\nAgility seemed to be the leading feature of Psmith’s tactics. He was\r\neverywhere--on Mike’s bed, on his own, on Jellicoe’s (drawing a\r\npassionate complaint from that non-combatant, on whose face he\r\ninadvertently trod), on the floor--he ranged the room, sowing\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were disheartened; they had started with the idea that this\r\nwas to be a surprise attack, and it was disconcerting to find the\r\ngarrison armed at all points. Gradually they edged to the door, and a\r\nfinal rush sent them through.\r\n\r\n“Hold the door for a second,” cried Psmith, and vanished. Mike was\r\nalone in the doorway.\r\n\r\nIt was a situation which exactly suited his frame of mind; he stood\r\nalone in direct opposition to the community into which Fate had\r\npitchforked him so abruptly. He liked the feeling; for the first time\r\nsince his father had given him his views upon school reports that\r\nmorning in the Easter holidays, he felt satisfied with life. He hoped,\r\noutnumbered as he was, that the enemy would come on again and not give\r\nthe thing up in disgust; he wanted more.\r\n\r\nOn an occasion like this there is rarely anything approaching\r\nconcerted action on the part of the aggressors. When the attack came,\r\nit was not a combined attack; Stone, who was nearest to the door, made\r\na sudden dash forward, and Mike hit him under the chin.\r\n\r\nStone drew back, and there was another interval for rest and\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nIt was interrupted by the reappearance of Psmith, who strolled back\r\nalong the passage swinging his dressing-gown cord as if it were some\r\nclouded cane.\r\n\r\n“Sorry to keep you waiting, Comrade Jackson,” he said politely. “Duty\r\ncalled me elsewhere. With the kindly aid of a guide who knows the lie\r\nof the land, I have been making a short tour of the dormitories. I\r\nhave poured divers jugfuls of water over Comrade Spiller’s bed,\r\nComrade Robinson’s bed, Comrade Stone’s--Spiller, Spiller, these are\r\nharsh words; where you pick them up I can’t think--not from me. Well,\r\nwell, I suppose there must be an end to the pleasantest of functions.\r\nGood-night, good-night.”\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind Mike and himself. For ten minutes shufflings\r\nand whisperings went on in the corridor, but nobody touched the\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nThen there was a sound of retreating footsteps, and silence reigned.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning there was a notice on the house-board. It\r\nran:\r\n\r\n   INDOOR GAMES\r\n\r\n   Dormitory-raiders are informed that in future neither\r\n   Mr. Psmith nor Mr. Jackson will be at home to visitors.\r\n   This nuisance must now cease.\r\n\r\n                                R. PSMITH.\r\n                                M. JACKSON."
