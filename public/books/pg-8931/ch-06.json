    "On his native asphalt there are few situations capable of throwing the\r\nNew York policeman off his balance. In that favored clime, _savoir\r\nfaire_ is represented by a shrewd left hook at the jaw, and a masterful\r\nstroke of the truncheon amounts to a satisfactory repartee. Thus shall\r\nyou never take the policeman of Manhattan without his answer. In other\r\nsurroundings, Mr. Patrick McEachern would have known how to deal with\r\nhis young acquaintance, Mr. Jimmy Pitt. But another plan of action was\r\nneeded here. First of all, the hints on etiquette with which Lady Jane\r\nhad favored him, from time to time, and foremost came the mandate:\r\n\"Never make a scene.\" Scenes, Lady Jane had explained--on the occasion\r\nof his knocking down an objectionable cabman during their honeymoon\r\ntrip--were of all things what polite society most resolutely abhorred.\r\nThe natural man in him must be bound in chains. The sturdy blow must\r\ngive way to the honeyed word. A cold \"Really!\" was the most vigorous\r\nretort that the best circles would countenance.\r\n\r\nIt had cost Mr. McEachern some pains to learn this lesson, but he had\r\ndone it; and he proceeded on the present occasion to conduct himself\r\nhigh and disposedly, according to instructions from headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe surprise of finding an old acquaintance in this company rendered\r\nhim dumb for a brief space, during which Jimmy looked after the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. McEachern?\" inquired Jimmy genially. \"Quite a\r\nsurprise meeting you in England. A pleasant surprise. By the way, one\r\ngenerally shakes hands in the smartest circles. Yours seem to be down\r\nthere somewhere. Might I trouble you? Right. Got it? Thanks!\"\r\n\r\nHe bent forward, possessed himself of Mr. McEachern's right hand,\r\nwhich was hanging limply at its proprietor's side, shook it warmly,\r\nand replaced it.\r\n\r\n\"'Wahye?\" asked Mr. McEachern gruffly, giving a pleasing air of\r\nnovelty to the hackneyed salutation by pronouncing it as one word. He\r\ntook some little time getting into his stride when carrying on polite\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, thank you. You're looking as strong as ever, Mr.\r\nMcEachern.\"\r\n\r\nThe ex-policeman grunted. In a conversational sense, he was sparring\r\nfor wind.\r\n\r\nMolly had regained her composure by this time. Her father was taking\r\nthe thing better than she had expected.\r\n\r\n\"It's Jimmy, father, dear,\" she said. \"Jimmy Pitt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear old James,\" murmured the visitor.\r\n\r\n\"I know, me dear, I know. Wahye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still well,\" replied Jimmy cheerfully. \"Sitting up, you will notice,\"\r\nhe added, waving a hand in the direction of his teacup, \"and taking\r\nnourishment. No further bulletins will be issued.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy is staying here, father. He is the friend Spennie was\r\nbringing.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the friend that Spennie brought,\" said Jimmy in a rapid\r\nundertone. \"This is the maiden all forlorn who crossed the seas, and\r\nlived in the house that sheltered the friend that Spennie brought.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, me dear,\" said Mr. McEachern slowly. \"'Wah----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I've guessed that one already,\" said Jimmy. \"Ask me another.\"\r\n\r\nMolly looked reproachfully at him. His deplorable habit of chaffing\r\nher father had caused her trouble in the old days. It may be admitted\r\nthat this recreation of Jimmy's was not in the best taste; but it must\r\nalso be remembered that the relations between the two had always been\r\nout of the ordinary. Great as was his affection for Molly, Jimmy could\r\nnot recollect a time when war had not been raging in a greater or\r\nlesser degree between the ex-policeman and himself.\r\n\r\n\"It is very kind of you to invite me down here,\" said he. \"We shall be\r\nable to have some cozy chats over old times when I was a wanderer on\r\nthe face of the earth, and you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, yis,\" interrupted Mr. McEachern hastily, \"somewhere ilse,\r\naftherward.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall choose time and place, of course. I was only going to ask\r\nyou how you liked leaving the----\"\r\n\r\n\"United States?\" put in Mr. McEachern, with an eagerness which\r\nbroadened his questioner's friendly smile, as the Honorable Louis\r\nWesson came toward them.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not after saying it was not a wrinch at firrst, but I\r\nconsidered it best to lave Wall Street--Wall Street, ye understand,\r\nbefore----\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. Before you fell a victim to the feverish desire for reckless\r\nspeculation which is so marked a characteristic of the American\r\nbusiness man, what?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said the other, relieved.\r\n\r\n\"I, too, have been speculating,\" said Mr. Wesson, \"as to whether you\r\nwould care to show me the rose garden, Miss McEachern, as you promised\r\nyesterday. Of all flowers, I love roses best. You remember Bryant's\r\nlines, Miss McEachern? 'The rose that lives its little hour is prized\r\nbeyond the sculptured flower.'\"\r\n\r\nJimmy interposed firmly. \"I'm very sorry,\" he said, \"but the fact is\r\nMiss McEachern has just promised to take me with her to feed the\r\nfowls.\r\n\r\n\"I gamble on fowls,\" he thought. \"There must be some in a high-class\r\nestablishment of this kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd quite forgotten,\" said Molly.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you had. We'd better start at once. Nothing upsets a fowl\r\nmore than having to wait for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, me dear Molly,\" said Mr. McEachern bluffly. \"Run along and\r\nshow Mr. Wesson the roses. Nobody wants to waste time over a bunch of\r\nhens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Jimmy thoughtfully, \"perhaps not. I might be\r\nbetter employed here, amusing the people by telling them all about our\r\nold New York days and----\"\r\n\r\nMr. McEachern might have been observed, and was so observed by Jimmy,\r\nto swallow somewhat convulsively.\r\n\r\n\"But as Molly promised ye----\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Jimmy. \"My own sentiments, neatly expressed. Shall we\r\nstart, Miss McEachern?\"\r\n\r\n\"That fellah,\" said Mr. Wesson solemnly to his immortal soul, \"is a\r\ndamn bounder. _And_ cad,\" he added after a moment's reflection.\r\n\r\nThe fowls lived in a little world of noise and smells at the back of\r\nthe stables. The first half of the journey thither was performed in\r\nsilence. Molly's cheerful little face was set in what she probably\r\nimagined to be a forbidding scowl. The tilt of her chin spoke of\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n\"If a penny would be any use to you,\" said Jimmy, breaking the\r\ntension.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not at all pleased with you,\" said Molly severely.\r\n\r\n\"How _can_ you say such savage things! And me an orphan, too!\r\nWhat's the trouble? What have I done?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know perfectly well. Making fun of father like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl, he loved it. Brainy badinage of that sort is exchanged\r\nevery day in the best society. You should hear dukes and earls! The\r\nwit! the _esprit_! The flow of soul! Mine is nothing to it. What's this\r\nin the iron pot? Is this what you feed them? Queer birds, hens--I\r\nwouldn't touch the stuff for a fortune. It looks perfectly poisonous.\r\nFlock around, you pullets. Come in your thousands. All bad nuts\r\nreturned, and a souvenir goes with every corpse. A little more of this\r\nputrescent mixture for you, sir. Certainly, pick up your dead, pick up\r\nyour dead.\"\r\n\r\nAn unwilling dimple appeared on Molly's chin, like a sunbeam through\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" she said, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself,\r\nJimmy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't time when I find myself stopping in the same house with a\r\ngirl I've been looking for for three years.\"\r\n\r\nMolly looked away. There was silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Used you ever to think of me?\" she said quietly.\r\n\r\nThat curious constraint which had fallen upon Jimmy in the road came\r\nto him again, now, as sobering as a blow. Something which he could not\r\ndefine had changed the atmosphere. Suddenly in an instant, like a\r\nshallow stream that runs babbling over the stones into some broad,\r\nstill pool, the note of their talk had deepened.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said simply. He could find no words for what he wished to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\"I've thought of you--often,\" said Molly.\r\n\r\nHe took a step toward her. But the moment had passed. Her mood had\r\nchanged in a flash, or seemed to have changed. The stream babbled on\r\nover the stones again.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, Jimmy! You nearly touched me with the spoon. I don't want\r\nto be covered with that horrible stuff. Look at that poor, little\r\nchicken out there in the cold. It hasn't had a morsel.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy responded to her lead. There was nothing else for him to do.\r\n\r\n\"It's in luck,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Give it a spoonful.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can have one if it likes. But it's taking big risks. Here you are,\r\nHercules. Pitch in.\"\r\n\r\nHe scraped the last spoonful out of the iron pot, and they began to\r\nwalk back to the house.\r\n\r\n\"You're very quiet, Jimmy,\" said Molly.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lots of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"That among others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear old New York,\" said Molly, with a little sigh. \"I'm not sure it\r\nwasn't--I mean, I sometimes wish--oh, you know. I mean it's lovely\r\nhere, but it _was_ nice in the old days, wasn't it, Jimmy? It's a pity\r\nthat things change, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It depends.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind things changing, if people don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I've changed? You said I hadn't when we met in the\r\nroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't, as far as looks go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I changed in other ways?\"\r\n\r\nJimmy looked at her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he said slowly.\r\n\r\nThey were in the hall, now. Keggs had just left after beating the\r\ndressing gong. The echoes of it still lingered. Molly paused on the\r\nbottom step.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't, Jimmy,\" she said; and ran on up the stairs."
