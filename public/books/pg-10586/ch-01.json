WRYKYN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Evelyn Waugh's book _Decline and Fall_ his hero, applying for a post\r\nas a schoolmaster, is told by the agent, \"We class schools in four\r\ngrades--leading school, first-rate school, good school, and school.\"\r\nSedleigh in Mike and Psmith would, I suppose, come into the last-named\r\nclass, though not quite as low in it as Mr. Waugh's Llanabba. It is one\r\nof those small English schools with aspirations one day to be able to\r\nput the word \"public\" before their name and to have their headmaster\r\nqualified to attend the annual Headmaster's Conference. All it needs is\r\na few more Adairs to get things going. And there is this to be noted,\r\nthat even at a \"school\" one gets an excellent education. Its only\r\ndrawback is that it does not play the leading schools or the first-rate\r\nschools or even the good schools at cricket. But to Mike, fresh from\r\nWrykyn (a \"first-rate school\") and Psmith, coming from Eton (a \"leading\r\nschool\") Sedleigh naturally seemed something of a comedown. It took Mike\r\nsome time to adjust himself to it, though Psmith, the philosopher,\r\naccepted the change of conditions with his customary equanimity.\r\n\r\nThis was the first appearance of Psmith. He came into two other books,\r\n_Psmith in the City_ and _Psmith, Journalist_, before becoming happily\r\nmarried in _Leave It to Psmith_, but I have always thought that he was\r\nmost at home in this story of English school life. To give full play to\r\nhis bland clashings with Authority he needs to have authority to clash\r\nwith, and there is none more absolute than that of the masters at an\r\nEnglish school.\r\n\r\nPsmith has the distinction of being the only one of my numerous\r\ncharacters to be drawn from a living model. A cousin of mine was at Eton\r\nwith the son of D'Oyly Carte, the man who produced the Gilbert and\r\nSullivan operettas, and one night he told me about this peculiar\r\nschoolboy who dressed fastidiously and wore a monocle and who, when one\r\nof the masters inquired after his health, replied \"Sir, I grow thinnah\r\nand thinnah.\" It was all the information I required in order to start\r\nbuilding him in a star part.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is curious as to what became of Mike and Psmith in later life,\r\nI can supply the facts. Mike, always devoted to country life, ran a\r\nprosperous farm. Psmith, inevitably perhaps, became an equally\r\nprosperous counselor at the bar like Perry Mason, specializing, like\r\nPerry, in appearing for the defense.\r\n\r\nI must apologize, as I did in the preface to _Mike at Wrykyn,_ for all\r\nthe cricket in this book. It was unavoidable. There is, however, not\r\nquite so much of it this time.\r\n\r\nP.G. Wodehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nMR. JACKSON MAKES UP HIS MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Mike had been in time for breakfast that fatal Easter morning he\r\nmight have gathered from the expression on his father's face, as Mr.\r\nJackson opened the envelope containing his school report and read the\r\ncontents, that the document in question was not exactly a paean of\r\npraise from beginning to end. But he was late, as usual. Mike always was\r\nlate for breakfast in the holidays.\r\n\r\nWhen he came down on this particular morning, the meal was nearly over.\r\nMr. Jackson had disappeared, taking his correspondence with him; Mrs.\r\nJackson had gone into the kitchen, and when Mike appeared the thing had\r\nresolved itself into a mere vulgar brawl between Phyllis and Ella for\r\nthe jam, while Marjory, recently affecting a grown-up air, looked on in\r\na detached sort of way, as if these juvenile gambols distressed her.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Mike,\" she said, jumping up as he entered, \"here you are--I've\r\nbeen keeping everything hot for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you? Thanks awfully. I say ...\" His eye wandered in mild surprise\r\nround the table. \"I'm a bit late.\"\r\n\r\nMarjory was bustling about, fetching and carrying for Mike, as she\r\nalways did. She had adopted him at an early age, and did the thing\r\nthoroughly. She was fond of her other brothers, especially when they\r\nmade centuries in first-class cricket, but Mike was her favorite. She\r\nwould field out in the deep as a natural thing when Mike was batting at\r\nthe net in the paddock, though for the others, even for Joe, who had\r\nplayed in all five Test Matches in the previous summer, she would do it\r\nonly as a favor.\r\n\r\nPhyllis and Ella finished their dispute and went out. Marjory sat on the\r\ntable and watched Mike eat.\r\n\r\n\"Your report came this morning, Mike,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys failed to retain Mike's undivided attention. He looked up\r\ninterested. \"What did it say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't see--I only caught sight of the Wrykyn crest on the envelope.\r\nFather didn't say anything.\"\r\n\r\nMike seemed concerned. \"I say, that looks rather rotten! I wonder if it\r\nwas awfully bad. It's the first I've had from Appleby.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be any worse than the horrid ones Mr. Blake used to write when\r\nyou were in his form.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's a comfort,\" said Mike philosophically. \"Think there's any\r\nmore tea in that pot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I call it a shame,\" said Marjory; \"they ought to be jolly glad to have\r\nyou at Wrykyn just for cricket, instead of writing beastly reports that\r\nmake father angry and don't do any good to anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last Christmas he said he'd take me away if I got another one.\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't mean it really, I _know_ he didn't! He couldn't! You're the\r\nbest bat Wrykyn's ever had.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ho!\" interpolated Mike.\r\n\r\n\"You _are_. Everybody says you are. Why, you got your first the very\r\nfirst term you were there--even Joe didn't do anything nearly so good as\r\nthat. Saunders says you're simply bound to play for England in another\r\nyear or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saunders is a jolly good chap. He bowled me a half volley on the off\r\nthe first ball I had in a school match. By the way, I wonder if he's out\r\nat the net now. Let's go and see.\"\r\n\r\nSaunders the professional was setting up the net when they arrived. Mike\r\nput on his pads and went to the wicket, while Marjory and the dogs\r\nretired as usual to the far hedge to retrieve.\r\n\r\nShe was kept busy. Saunders was a good sound bowler of the M.C.C. minor\r\nmatch type, and there had been a time when he had worried Mike\r\nconsiderably, but Mike had been in the Wrykyn team for three seasons\r\nnow, and each season he had advanced tremendously in his batting. He had\r\nfilled out in three years. He had always had the style, and now he had\r\nthe strength as well, Saunder's bowling on a true wicket seemed simple\r\nto him. It was early in the Easter holidays, but already he was\r\nbeginning to find his form. Saunders, who looked on Mike as his own\r\nspecial invention, was delighted.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't be worried by being too anxious now that you're captain,\r\nMaster Mike,\" he said, \"you'll make a century every match next term.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I wasn't; it's a beastly responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nHenfrey, the Wrykyn cricket captain of the previous season, was not\r\nreturning next term, and Mike was to reign in his stead. He liked the\r\nprospect, but it certainly carried with it a rather awe-inspiring\r\nresponsibility. At night sometimes he would lie awake, appalled by the\r\nfear of losing his form, or making a hash of things by choosing the\r\nwrong men to play for the school and leaving the right men out. It is no\r\nlight thing to captain a public school at cricket.\r\n\r\nAs he was walking toward the house, Phyllis met him. \"Oh, I've been\r\nhunting for you, Mike; Father wants you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's in the study. He seems ...\" added Phyllis, throwing in the\r\ninformation by a way of a makeweight, \"in a beastly temper.\"\r\n\r\nMike's jaw fell slightly. \"I hope the dickens it's nothing to do with\r\nthat bally report,\" was his muttered exclamation.\r\n\r\nMike's dealings with his father were as a rule of a most pleasant\r\nnature. Mr. Jackson was an understanding sort of man, who treated his\r\nsons as companions. From time to time, however, breezes were apt to\r\nruffle the placid sea of good fellowship. Mike's end-of-term report was\r\nan unfailing wind raiser; indeed, on the arrival of Mr. Blake's\r\nsarcastic resume of Mike's shortcomings at the end of the previous term,\r\nthere had been something not unlike a typhoon. It was on this occasion\r\nthat Mr. Jackson had solemnly declared his intention of removing Mike\r\nfrom Wrykyn unless the critics became more flattering; and Mr. Jackson\r\nwas a man of his word.\r\n\r\nIt was with a certain amount of apprehension, therefore, that Jackson\r\nentered the study.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Mike,\" said his father, kicking the waste-paper basket; \"I\r\nwant to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\nMike, skilled in omens, scented a row in the offing. Only in moments of\r\nemotion was Mr. Jackson in the habit of booting the basket.\r\n\r\nThere followed an awkward silence, which Mike broke by remarking that he\r\nhad carted a half volley from Saunders over the on-side hedge\r\nthat morning.\r\n\r\n\"It was just a bit short and off the leg stump, so I stepped out--may I\r\nbag the paper knife for a jiffy? I'll just show--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind about cricket now,\" said Mr. Jackson; \"I want you to listen\r\nto this report.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is that my report, Father?\" said Mike, with a sort of sickly\r\ninterest, much as a dog about to be washed might evince in his tub.\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" replied Mr. Jackson in measured tones, \"your report; what is\r\nmore, it is without exception the worst report you have ever had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say!\" groaned the record-breaker.\r\n\r\n\"'His conduct,'\" quoted Mr. Jackson, \"'has been unsatisfactory in the\r\nextreme, both in and out of school.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't anything really. I only happened--\"\r\n\r\nRemembering suddenly that what he had happened to do was to drop a\r\ncannonball (the school weight) on the form-room floor, not once, but on\r\nseveral occasions, he paused.\r\n\r\n\"'French bad; conduct disgraceful--'\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody rags in French.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Mathematics bad. Inattentive and idle.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody does much work in Math.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Latin poor. Greek, very poor.'\"\r\n\r\n\"We were doing Thucydides, Book Two, last term--all speeches and\r\ndoubtful readings, and cruxes and things--beastly hard! Everybody\r\nsays so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are Mr. Appleby's remarks: 'The boy has genuine ability, which he\r\ndeclines to use in the smallest degree.'\"\r\n\r\nMike moaned a moan of righteous indignation.\r\n\r\n\"'An abnormal proficiency at games has apparently destroyed all desire\r\nin him to realize the more serious issues of life.' There is more to the\r\nsame effect.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Appleby was a master with very definite ideas as to what constituted\r\na public-school master's duties. As a man he was distinctly pro-Mike. He\r\nunderstood cricket, and some of Mike's strokes on the off gave him\r\nthrills of pure aesthetic joy; but as a master he always made it his\r\nhabit to regard the manners and customs of the boys in his form with an\r\nunbiased eye, and to an unbiased eye Mike in a form room was about as\r\nnear the extreme edge as a boy could be, and Mr. Appleby said as much in\r\na clear firm hand.\r\n\r\n\"You remember what I said to you about your report at Christmas, Mike?\"\r\nsaid Mr. Jackson, folding the lethal document and replacing it in\r\nits envelope.\r\n\r\nMike said nothing; there was a sinking feeling in his interior.\r\n\r\n\"I shall abide by what I said.\"\r\n\r\nMike's heart thumped.\r\n\r\n\"You will not go back to Wrykyn next term.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the world the sun was shining, birds were twittering;\r\nsomewhere in the world lambkins frisked and peasants sang blithely at\r\ntheir toil (flat, perhaps, but still blithely), but to Mike at that\r\nmoment the sky was black, and an icy wind blew over the face of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy had happened, and there was an end of it. He made no attempt\r\nto appeal against the sentence. He knew it would be useless, his father,\r\nwhen he made up his mind, having all the unbending tenacity of the\r\nnormally easygoing man.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson was sorry for Mike. He understood him, and for that reason\r\nhe said very little now.\r\n\r\n\"I am sending you to Sedleigh,\" was his next remark.\r\n\r\nSedleigh! Mike sat up with a jerk. He knew Sedleigh by name--one of\r\nthose schools with about a hundred boys which you never hear of except\r\nwhen they send up their gym team to Aldershot, or their Eight to Bisley.\r\nMike's outlook on life was that of a cricketer, pure and simple. What\r\nhad Sedleigh ever done? What were they ever likely to do? Whom did they\r\nplay? What Old Sedleighan had ever done anything at cricket? Perhaps\r\nthey didn't even _play_ cricket!\r\n\r\n\"But it's an awful hole,\" he said blankly.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson could read Mike's mind like a book. Mike's point of view was\r\nplain to him. He did not approve of it, but he knew that in Mike's place\r\nand at Mike's age he would have felt the same. He spoke dryly to hide\r\nhis sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a large school,\" he said, \"and I don't suppose it could play\r\nWrykyn at cricket, but it has one merit--boys work there. Young Barlitt\r\nwon a Balliol scholarship from Sedleigh last year.\" Barlitt was the\r\nvicar's son, a silent, spectacled youth who did not enter very largely\r\ninto Mike's world. They had met occasionally at tennis parties, but not\r\nmuch conversation had ensued. Barlitt's mind was massive, but his topics\r\nof conversation were not Mike's.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barlitt speaks very highly of Sedleigh,\" added Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\nMike said nothing, which was a good deal better than saying what he\r\nwould have liked to have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nSEDLEIGH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train, which had been stopping everywhere for the last half hour,\r\npulled up again, and Mike, seeing the name of the station, got up,\r\nopened the door, and hurled a bag out on to the platform in an emphatic\r\nand vindictive manner. Then he got out himself and looked about him.\r\n\r\n\"For the school, sir?\" inquired the solitary porter, bustling up, as if\r\nhe hoped by sheer energy to deceive the traveler into thinking that\r\nSedleigh station was staffed by a great army of porters.\r\n\r\nMike nodded. A somber nod. The nod Napoleon might have given if somebody\r\nhad met him in 1812, and said, \"So you're back from Moscow, eh?\" Mike\r\nwas feeling thoroughly jaundiced. The future seemed wholly gloomy. And,\r\nso far from attempting to make the best of things, he had set himself\r\ndeliberately to look on the dark side. He thought, for instance, that he\r\nhad never seen a more repulsive porter, or one more obviously\r\nincompetent than the man who had attached himself with a firm grasp to\r\nthe handle of the bag as he strode off in the direction of the luggage\r\nvan. He disliked his voice, his appearance, and the color of his hair.\r\nAlso the boots he wore. He hated the station, and the man who took\r\nhis ticket.\r\n\r\n\"Young gents at the school, sir,\" said the porter, perceiving from\r\nMike's _distrait_ air that the boy was a stranger to the place, \"goes up\r\nin the bus mostly. It's waiting here, sir. Hi, George!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll walk, thanks,\" said Mike frigidly.\r\n\r\n\"It's a goodish step, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir. I'll send up your luggage by the bus, sir. Which 'ouse\r\nwas it you was going to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Outwood's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, sir. It's straight on up this road to the school. You can't miss\r\nit, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse luck,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nHe walked off up the road, sorrier for himself than ever. It was such\r\nabsolutely rotten luck. About now, instead of being on his way to a\r\nplace where they probably ran a Halma team instead of a cricket eleven,\r\nand played hunt-the-slipper in winter, he would be on the point of\r\narriving at Wrykyn. And as captain of cricket, at that. Which was the\r\nbitter part of it. He had never been in command. For the last two\r\nseasons he had been the star man, going in first, and heading the\r\naverages easily at the end of the season; and the three captains under\r\nwhom he had played during his career as a Wrykynian, Burgess, Enderby,\r\nand Henfrey, had always been sportsmen to him. But it was not the same\r\nthing. He had meant to do such a lot for Wrykyn cricket this term. He\r\nhad had an entirely new system of coaching in his mind. Now it might\r\nnever be used. He had handed it on in a letter to Strachan, who would be\r\ncaptain in his place; but probably Strachan would have some scheme of\r\nhis own. There is nobody who could not edit a paper in the ideal way;\r\nand there is nobody who has not a theory of his own about cricket\r\ncoaching at school.\r\n\r\nWrykyn, too, would be weak this year, now that he was no longer there.\r\nStrachan was a good, free bat on his day, and, if he survived a few\r\novers, might make a century in an hour, but he was not to be depended\r\nupon. There was no doubt that Mike's sudden withdrawal meant that Wrykyn\r\nwould have a bad time that season. And it had been such a wretched\r\nathletic year for the school. The football fifteen had been hopeless,\r\nand had lost both the Ripton matches, the return by over sixty points.\r\nSheen's victory in the light weights at Aldershot had been their one\r\nsuccess. And now, on top of all this, the captain of cricket was removed\r\nduring the Easter holidays. Mike's heart bled for Wrykyn, and he found\r\nhimself loathing Sedleigh and all its works with a great loathing.\r\n\r\nThe only thing he could find in its favor was the fact that it was set\r\nin a very pretty country. Of a different type from the Wrykyn country,\r\nbut almost as good. For three miles Mike made his way through woods and\r\npast fields. Once he crossed a river. It was soon after this that he\r\ncaught sight, from the top of a hill, of a group of buildings that wore\r\nan unmistakably schoollike look.\r\n\r\nThis must be Sedleigh.\r\n\r\nTen minutes' walk brought him to the school gates, and a baker's boy\r\ndirected him to Mr. Outwood's.\r\n\r\nThere were three houses in a row, separated from the school buildings by\r\na cricket field. Outwood's was the middle one of these.\r\n\r\nMike went to the front door and knocked. At Wrykyn he had always charged\r\nin at the beginning of term at the boys' entrance, but this formal\r\nreporting of himself at Sedleigh suited his mood.\r\n\r\nHe inquired for Mr. Outwood, and was shown into a room lined with books.\r\nPresently the door opened, and the housemaster appeared.\r\n\r\nThere was something pleasant and homely about Mr. Outwood. In appearance\r\nhe reminded Mike of Smee in _Peter Pan_. He had the same eyebrows and\r\npince-nez and the same motherly look.\r\n\r\n\"Jackson?\" he said mildly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to see you, very glad indeed. Perhaps you would like a\r\ncup of tea after your journey. I think you might like a cup of tea. You\r\ncome from Crofton, in Shropshire, I understand, Jackson, near\r\nBrindleford? It is a part of the country which I have always wished to\r\nvisit. I dare say you have frequently seen the Cluniac Priory of St.\r\nAmbrose at Brindleford?\"\r\n\r\nMike, who would not have recognized a Cluniac Priory if you had handed\r\nhim one on a tray, said he had not.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! You have missed an opportunity which I should have been glad\r\nto have. I am preparing a book on Ruined Abbeys and Priories of England,\r\nand it has always been my wish to see the Cluniac Priory of St. Ambrose.\r\nA deeply interesting relic of the sixteenth century. Bishop Geoffrey,\r\n1133-40--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I go across to the boys' part, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Yes. Oh, yes. Quite so. And perhaps you would like a cup of tea\r\nafter your journey? No? Quite so. Quite so. You should make a point of\r\nvisiting the remains of the Cluniac Priory in the summer holidays,\r\nJackson. You will find the matron in her room. In many respects it is\r\nunique. The northern altar is in a state of really wonderful\r\npreservation. It consists of a solid block of masonry five feet long and\r\ntwo and a half wide, with chamfered plinth, standing quite free from the\r\napse wall. It will well repay a visit. Good-bye for the present,\r\nJackson, good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nMike wandered across to the other side of the house, his gloom visibly\r\ndeepened. All alone in a strange school, where they probably played\r\nhopscotch, with a housemaster who offered one cups of tea after one's\r\njourney and talked about chamfered plinths and apses. It was a\r\nlittle hard.\r\n\r\nHe strayed about, finding his bearings, and finally came to a room which\r\nhe took to be the equivalent of the senior day room at a Wrykyn house.\r\nEverywhere else he had found nothing but emptiness. Evidently he had\r\ncome by an earlier train than was usual. But this room was occupied.\r\n\r\nA very long, thin youth, with a solemn face and immaculate clothes, was\r\nleaning against the mantelpiece. As Mike entered, he fumbled in his top\r\nleft waistcoat pocket, produced an eyeglass attached to a cord, and\r\nfixed it in his right eye. With the help of this aid to vision he\r\ninspected Mike in silence for a while, then, having flicked an invisible\r\nspeck of dust from the left sleeve of his coat, he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a tired voice.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Take a seat,\" said the immaculate one. \"If you don't mind dirtying your\r\nbags, that's to say. Personally, I don't see any prospect of ever\r\nsitting down in this place. It looks to me as if they meant to use these\r\nchairs as mustard-and-cress beds. A Nursery Garden in the Home. That\r\nsort of idea. My name,\" he added pensively, \"is Smith. What's yours?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nPSMITH\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Jackson,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the Bully, the Pride of the School, or the Boy who is Led\r\nAstray and takes to Drink in Chapter Sixteen?\"\r\n\r\n\"The last, for choice,\" said Mike, \"but I've only just arrived, so I\r\ndon't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boy--what will he become? Are you new here, too, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Why, are you new?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I look as if I belonged here? I'm the latest import. Sit down on\r\nyonder settee, and I will tell you the painful story of my life. By the\r\nway, before I start, there's just one thing. If you ever have occasion\r\nto write to me, would you mind sticking a P at the beginning of my name?\r\nP-s-m-i-t-h. See? There are too many Smiths, and I don't care for\r\nSmythe. My father's content to worry along in the old-fashioned way, but\r\nI've decided to strike out a fresh line. I shall found a new dynasty.\r\nThe resolve came to me unexpectedly this morning. I jotted it down on\r\nthe back of an envelope. In conversation you may address me as Rupert\r\n(though I hope you won't), or simply Smith, the _P_ not being sounded.\r\nCompare the name Zbysco, in which the Z is given a similar\r\nmiss-in-balk. See?\"\r\n\r\nMike said he saw. Psmith thanked him with a certain stately old world\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\n\"Let us start at the beginning,\" he resumed. \"My infancy. When I was but\r\na babe, my eldest sister was bribed with a shilling an hour by my nurse\r\nto keep an eye on me, and see that I did not raise Cain. At the end of\r\nthe first day she struck for one-and-six, and got it. We now pass to my\r\nboyhood. At an early age, I was sent to Eton, everybody predicting a\r\nbright career for me. But,\" said Psmith solemnly, fixing an owl-like\r\ngaze on Mike through the eyeglass, \"it was not to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"No. I was superannuated last term.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Eton, yes. But what Eton loses, Sedleigh gains.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why Sedleigh, of all places?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the most painful part of my narrative. It seems that a certain\r\nscug in the next village to ours happened last year to collar a\r\nBalliol--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Barlitt!\" exclaimed Mike.\r\n\r\n\"That was the man. The son of the vicar. The vicar told the curate, who\r\ntold our curate, who told our vicar, who told my father, who sent me off\r\nhere to get a Balliol too. Do _you_ know Barlitt?\"\r\n\r\n\"His father's vicar of our village. It was because his son got a Balliol\r\nthat I was sent here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you come from Crofton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've lived at Lower Benford all my life. We are practically long-lost\r\nbrothers. Cheer a little, will you?\"\r\n\r\nMike felt as Robinson Crusoe felt when he met Friday. Here was a fellow\r\nhuman being in this desert place. He could almost have embraced Psmith.\r\nThe very sound of the name Lower Benford was heartening. His dislike for\r\nhis new school was not diminished, but now he felt that life there might\r\nat least be tolerable.\r\n\r\n\"Where were you before you came here?\" asked Psmith. \"You have heard my\r\npainful story. Now tell me yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrykyn. My father took me away because I got such a lot of bad\r\nreports.\"\r\n\r\n\"My reports from Eton were simply scurrilous. There's a libel action in\r\nevery sentence. How do you like this place, from what you've seen\r\nof it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am with you, Comrade Jackson. You won't mind my calling you Comrade,\r\nwill you? I've just become a socialist. It's a great scheme. You ought\r\nto be one. You work for the equal distribution of property, and start by\r\ncollaring all you can and sitting on it. We must stick together. We are\r\ncompanions in misfortune. Lost lambs. Sheep that have gone astray.\r\nDivided, we fall, together we may worry through. Have you seen Professor\r\nRadium yet? I should say Mr. Outwood. What do you think of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't seem a bad sort of chap. Bit off his nut. Jawed about apses\r\nand things.\"\r\n\r\n\"And thereby,\" said Psmith, \"hangs a tale. I've been making inquiries of\r\na stout sportsman in a sort of Salvation Army uniform, whom I met in the\r\ngrounds--he's the school sergeant or something, quite a solid man--and I\r\nhear that Comrade Outwood's an archaeological cove. Goes about the\r\ncountry beating up old ruins and fossils and things. There's an\r\nArchaeological Society in the school, run by him. It goes out on\r\nhalf-holidays, prowling about, and is allowed to break bounds and\r\ngenerally steep itself to the eyebrows in reckless devilry. And, mark\r\nyou, laddie, if you belong to the Archaeological Society you get off\r\ncricket. To get off cricket,\" said Psmith, dusting his right trouser\r\nleg, \"was the dream of my youth and the aspiration of my riper years. A\r\nnoble game, but a bit too thick for me. At Eton I used to have to field\r\nout at the nets till the soles of my boots wore through. I suppose you\r\nare a blood at the game? Play for the school against Loamshire, and\r\nso on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to play here, at any rate,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nHe had made up his mind on this point in the train. There is a certain\r\nfascination about making the very worst of a bad job. Achilles knew his\r\nbusiness when he sat in his tent. The determination not to play cricket\r\nfor Sedleigh as he could not play for Wrykyn gave Mike a sort of\r\npleasure. To stand by with folded arms and a somber frown, as it were,\r\nwas one way of treating the situation, and one not without its meed\r\nof comfort.\r\n\r\nPsmith approved the resolve.\r\n\r\n\"Stout fellow,\" he said. \"'Tis well. You and I, hand in hand, will\r\nsearch the countryside for ruined abbeys. We will snare the elusive\r\nfossil together. Above all, we will go out of bounds. We shall thus\r\nimprove our minds, and have a jolly good time as well. I shouldn't\r\nwonder if one mightn't borrow a gun from some friendly native, and do a\r\nbit of rabbit shooting here and there. From what I saw of Comrade\r\nOutwood during our brief interview, I shouldn't think he was one of the\r\nlynx-eyed contingent. With tact we ought to be able to slip away from\r\nthe merry throng of fossil chasers, and do a bit on our own account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good idea,\" said Mike. \"We will. A chap at Wrykyn, called Wyatt, used\r\nto break out at night and shoot at cats with an air pistol.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would take a lot to make me do that. I am all against anything that\r\ninterferes with my sleep. But rabbits in the daytime is a scheme. We'll\r\nnose about for a gun at the earliest opp. Meanwhile we'd better go up to\r\nComrade Outwood, and get our names shoved down for the Society.\"\r\n\r\n\"I vote we get some tea first somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's beat up a study. I suppose they have studies here. Let's go\r\nand look.\"\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs. On the first floor there was a passage with doors on\r\neither side. Psmith opened the first of these.\r\n\r\n\"This'll do us well,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was a biggish room, looking out over the school grounds. There were a\r\ncouple of deal tables, two empty bookcases, and a looking glass, hung\r\non a nail.\r\n\r\n\"Might have been made for us,\" said Psmith approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it belongs to some rotter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You aren't going to collar it!\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Psmith, looking at himself earnestly in the mirror, and\r\nstraightening his tie, \"is the exact program. We must stake out our\r\nclaims. This is practical socialism.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the real owner's bound to turn up some time or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"His misfortune, not ours. You can't expect two masterminds like us to\r\npig it in that room downstairs. There are moments when one wants to be\r\nalone. It is imperative that we have a place to retire to after a\r\nfatiguing day. And now, if you want to be really useful, come and help\r\nme fetch up my box from downstairs. It's got a gas ring and various\r\nthings in it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nSTAKING OUT A CLAIM\r\n\r\n\r\nPsmith, in the matter of decorating a study and preparing tea in it, was\r\nrather a critic than an executant. He was full of ideas, but he\r\npreferred to allow Mike to carry them out. It was he who suggested that\r\nthe wooden bar which ran across the window was unnecessary, but it was\r\nMike who wrenched it from its place. Similarly, it was Mike who\r\nabstracted the key from the door of the next study, though the idea\r\nwas Psmith's.\r\n\r\n\"Privacy,\" said Psmith, as he watched Mike light the gas ring, \"is what\r\nwe chiefly need in this age of publicity. If you leave a study door\r\nunlocked in these strenuous times, the first thing you know is, somebody\r\ncomes right in, sits down, and begins to talk about himself. I think\r\nwith a little care we ought to be able to make this room quite decently\r\ncomfortable. That putrid calendar must come down, though. Do you think\r\nyou could make a long arm, and haul it off the parent tintack? Thanks.\r\nWe make progress. We make progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall jolly well make it out of the window,\" said Mike, spooning up\r\ntea from a paperbag with a postcard, \"if a sort of young Hackenschmidt\r\nturns up and claims the study. What are you going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let us worry about it. I have a presentiment that he will be an\r\ninsignificant-looking little weed. How are you getting on with the\r\nevening meal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just ready. What would you give to be at Eton now? I'd give something\r\nto be at Wrykyn.\"\r\n\r\n\"These school reports,\" said Psmith sympathetically, \"are the very\r\ndickens. Many a bright young lad has been soured by them. Hello, what's\r\nthis, I wonder.\"\r\n\r\nA heavy body had plunged against the door, evidently without a suspicion\r\nthat there would be any resistance. A rattling of the handle followed,\r\nand a voice outside said, \"Dash the door!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hackenschmidt!\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"The weed,\" said Psmith. \"You couldn't make a long arm, could you, and\r\nturn the key? We had better give this merchant audience. Remind me later\r\nto go on with my remarks on school reports. I had several bright things\r\nto say on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nMike unlocked the door, and flung it open. Framed in the entrance was a\r\nsmallish, freckled boy, wearing a pork-pie hat and carrying a bag. On\r\nhis face was an expression of mingled wrath and astonishment.\r\n\r\nPsmith rose courteously from his chair, and moved forward with slow\r\nstateliness to do the honors.\r\n\r\n\"What the dickens,\" inquired the newcomer, \"are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were having a little tea,\" said Psmith, \"to restore our tissues\r\nafter our journey. Come in and join us. We keep open house, we Psmiths.\r\nLet me introduce you to Comrade Jackson. A stout fellow. Homely in\r\nappearance, perhaps, but one of us. I am Psmith. Your own name will\r\ndoubtless come up in the course of general chitchat over the teacups.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name's Spiller, and this is my study.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith leaned against the mantelpiece, put up his eyeglass, and\r\nharangued Spiller in a philosophical vein.\r\n\r\n\"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,\" said he, \"the saddest are these:\r\n'It might have been.' Too late! That is the bitter cry. If you had torn\r\nyourself from the bosom of the Spiller family by an earlier train, all\r\nmight have been well. But no. Your father held your hand and said\r\nhuskily, 'Edwin, don't leave us!' Your mother clung to you weeping, and\r\nsaid, 'Edwin, stay!' Your sisters--\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know what--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sisters froze on to your knees like little octopuses (or octopi),\r\nand screamed, 'Don't go, Edwin!' And so,\" said Psmith, deeply affected\r\nby his recital, \"you stayed on till the later train; and, on arrival,\r\nyou find strange faces in the familiar room, a people that know not\r\nSpiller.\" Psmith went to the table, and cheered himself with a sip of\r\ntea. Spiller's sad case had moved him greatly.\r\n\r\nThe victim of Fate seemed in no way consoled.\r\n\r\n\"It's beastly cheek, that's what I call it. Are you new chaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"The very latest thing,\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's beastly cheek.\"\r\n\r\nMike's outlook on life was of the solid, practical order. He went\r\nstraight to the root of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nSpiller evaded the question.\r\n\r\n\"It's beastly cheek,\" he repeated. \"You can't go about the place bagging\r\nstudies.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we do,\" said Psmith. \"In this life, Comrade Spiller, we must be\r\nprepared for every emergency. We must distinguish between the unusual\r\nand the impossible. It is unusual for people to go about the place\r\nbagging studies, so you have rashly ordered your life on the assumption\r\nthat it is impossible. Error! Ah, Spiller, Spiller, let this be a\r\nlesson to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, I tell you what it--\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in a car with a man once. I said to him: 'What would happen if\r\nyou trod on that pedal thing instead of that other pedal thing?' He\r\nsaid, 'I couldn't. One's the foot brake, and the other's the\r\naccelerator.' 'But suppose you did?' I said. 'I wouldn't,' he said. 'Now\r\nwe'll let her rip.' So he stamped on the accelerator. Only it turned out\r\nto be the foot brake after all, and we stopped dead, and skidded into a\r\nditch. The advice I give to every young man starting life is: 'Never\r\nconfuse the unusual and the impossible.' Take the present case. If you\r\nhad only realized the possibility of somebody someday collaring your\r\nstudy, you might have thought out dozens of sound schemes for dealing\r\nwith the matter. As it is, you are unprepared. The thing comes on you as\r\na surprise. The cry goes round: 'Spiller has been taken unawares. He\r\ncannot cope with the situation.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I! I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"What _are_ you going to do about it?\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"All I know is, I'm going to have it. It was Simpson's last term, and\r\nSimpson's left, and I'm next on the house list, so, of course, it's\r\nmy study.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what steps,\" said Psmith, \"are you going to take? Spiller, the man\r\nof Logic, we know. But what of Spiller, the Man of Action? How do you\r\nintend to set about it? Force is useless. I was saying to Comrade\r\nJackson before you came in, that I didn't mind betting you were an\r\ninsignificant-looking little weed. And you _are_ an\r\ninsignificant-looking little weed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see what Outwood says about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not an unsound scheme. By no means a scaly project. Comrade Jackson and\r\nmyself were about to interview him upon another point. We may as well\r\nall go together.\"\r\n\r\nThe trio made their way to the Presence, Spiller pink and determined,\r\nMike sullen, Psmith particularly debonair. He hummed lightly as he\r\nwalked, and now and then pointed out to Spiller objects of interest by\r\nthe wayside.\r\n\r\nMr. Outwood received them with the motherly warmth which was evidently\r\nthe leading characteristic of his normal manner.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Spiller,\" he said. \"And Smith, and Jackson. I am glad to see you\r\nhave already made friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spiller's, sir,\" said Psmith, laying a hand patronizingly on the\r\nstudy-claimer's shoulder--a proceeding violently resented by\r\nSpiller--\"is a character one cannot help but respect. His nature expands\r\nbefore one like some beautiful flower.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Outwood received this eulogy with rather a startled expression, and\r\ngazed at the object of the tribute in a surprised way.\r\n\r\n\"Er--quite so, Smith, quite so,\" he said at last. \"I like to see boys in\r\nmy house friendly toward one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no vice in Spiller,\" pursued Psmith earnestly. \"His heart is\r\nthe heart of a little child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" burst out this paragon of all the virtues, \"I--\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was not entirely with regard to Spiller that I wished to speak\r\nto you, sir, if you were not too busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Smith, not at all. Is there anything ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir--\" began Spiller\r\n\r\n\"I understand, sir,\" said Psmith, \"that there is an Archaeological\r\nSociety in the school.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Outwood's eyes sparkled behind their pince-nez. It was a\r\ndisappointment to him that so few boys seemed to wish to belong to his\r\nchosen band. Cricket and football, games that left him cold, appeared to\r\nbe the main interest in their lives. It was but rarely that he could\r\ninduce new boys to join. His colleague, Mr. Downing, who presided over\r\nthe School Fire Brigade, never had any difficulty in finding support.\r\nBoys came readily at his call. Mr. Outwood pondered wistfully on this at\r\ntimes, not knowing that the Fire Brigade owed its support to the fact\r\nthat it provided its lighthearted members with perfectly unparalleled\r\nopportunities for ragging, while his own band, though small, was, in the\r\nmain, earnest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Smith,\" he said, \"Yes. We have a small Archaeological Society.\r\nI--er--in a measure look after it. Perhaps you would care to become\r\na member?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir--\" said Spiller.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, Spiller. Do you want to join, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Intensely, sir. Archaeology fascinates me. A grand pursuit, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly, Smith. I am very pleased, very pleased indeed. I will put\r\ndown your name at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Jackson's, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jackson, too!\" Mr. Outwood beamed. \"I am delighted. Most delighted.\r\nThis is capital. This enthusiasm is most capital.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spiller, sir,\" said Psmith sadly, \"I have been unable to induce to\r\njoin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is one of our oldest members.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Psmith, tolerantly, \"that accounts for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir--\" said Spiller.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, Spiller. We shall have the first outing of the term on\r\nSaturday. We intend to inspect the Roman Camp at Embury Hill, two miles\r\nfrom the school.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be there, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir--\" said Spiller.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, Spiller,\" said Psmith. \"There is just one other matter, if\r\nyou could spare the time, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Smith. What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would there be any objection to Jackson and myself taking Simpson's old\r\nstudy?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means, Smith. A very good idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. It would give us a place where we could work quietly in the\r\nevenings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Quite so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much, sir. We will move our things in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much, sir,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" shouted Spiller, \"aren't I to have it? I'm next on the\r\nlist, sir. I come next after Simpson. Can't I have it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I have already promised it to Smith, Spiller. You should\r\nhave spoken before.\"\r\n\r\n\"But sir--\"\r\n\r\nPsmith eyed the speaker pityingly.\r\n\r\n\"This tendency to delay, Spiller,\" he said, \"is your besetting fault.\r\nCorrect it, Edwin. Fight against it.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to Mr. Outwood.\r\n\r\n\"We should, of course, sir, always be glad to see Spiller in our study.\r\nHe would always find a cheery welcome waiting there for him. There is no\r\nformality between ourselves and Spiller.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. An excellent arrangement, Smith. I like this spirit of\r\ncomradeship in my house. Then you will be with us on Saturday?\"\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this sort of thing, Spiller,\" said Psmith, as they closed the door,\r\n\"is very, very trying for a man of culture. Look us up in our study one\r\nof these afternoons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nGUERRILLA WARFARE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There are few pleasures,\" said Psmith, as he resumed his favorite\r\nposition against the mantelpiece and surveyed the commandeered study\r\nwith the pride of a householder, \"keener to the reflective mind than\r\nsitting under one's own rooftree. This place would have been wasted on\r\nSpiller; he would not have appreciated it properly.\"\r\n\r\nMike was finishing his tea. \"You're a jolly useful chap to have by you\r\nin a crisis, Smith,\" he said with approval. \"We ought to have known each\r\nother before.\"\r\n\r\n\"The loss was mine,\" said Psmith courteously. \"We will now, with your\r\npermission, face the future for a while. I suppose you realize that we\r\nare now to a certain extent up against it. Spiller's hot Spanish blood\r\nis not going to sit tight and do nothing under a blow like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can he do? Outwood's given us the study.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have done if somebody had bagged your study?\"\r\n\r\n\"Made it jolly hot for them!\"\r\n\r\n\"So will Comrade Spiller. I take it that he will collect a gang and make\r\nan offensive movement against us directly he can. To all appearances we\r\nare in a fairly tight place. It all depends on how big Comrade Spiller's\r\ngang will be. I don't like rows, but I'm prepared to take on a\r\nreasonable number of assailants in defense of the home.\"\r\n\r\nMike intimated that he was with him on the point. \"The difficulty is,\r\nthough,\" he said, \"about when we leave this room. I mean, we're all\r\nright while we stick here, but we can't stay all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I was about to point out when you put it with such\r\nadmirable clearness. Here we are in a stronghold; they can only get at\r\nus through the door, and we can lock that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And jam a chair against it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_And_, as you rightly remark, jam a chair against it. But what of the\r\nnightfall? What of the time when we retire to our dormitory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or dormitories. I say, if we're in separate rooms we shall be in the\r\ncart.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith eyed Mike with approval. \"He thinks of everything! You're the\r\nman, Comrade Jackson, to conduct an affair of this kind--such foresight!\r\nsuch resource! We must see to this at once; if they put us in different\r\nrooms we're done--we shall be destroyed singly in the watches of\r\nthe night.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better nip down to the matron right off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the matron--Comrade Outwood is the man. We are as sons to him;\r\nthere is nothing he can deny us. I'm afraid we are quite spoiling his\r\nafternoon by these interruptions, but we must rout him out once more.\"\r\n\r\nAs they got up, the door handle rattled again, and this time there\r\nfollowed a knocking.\r\n\r\n\"This must be an emissary of Comrade Spiller's,\" said Psmith. \"Let us\r\nparley with the man.\"\r\n\r\nMike unlocked the door. A light-haired youth with a cheerful, rather\r\nvacant face and a receding chin strolled into the room, and stood\r\ngiggling with his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n\"I just came up to have a look at you,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"If you move a little to the left,\" said Psmith, \"you will catch the\r\nlight-and-shade effects on Jackson's face better.\"\r\n\r\nThe newcomer giggled with renewed vigor. \"Are you the chap with the\r\neyeglass who jaws all the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I _do_ wear an eyeglass,\" said Psmith; \"as to the rest of the\r\ndescription--\"\r\n\r\n\"My name's Jellicoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine is Psmith--P-s-m-i-t-h--one of the Shropshire Psmiths. The object\r\non the skyline is Comrade Jackson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Spiller,\" giggled Jellicoe, \"is cursing you like anything\r\ndownstairs. You _are_ chaps! Do you mean to say you simply bagged his\r\nstudy? He's making no end of a row about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spiller's fiery nature is a byword,\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"What's he going to do?\" asked Mike, in his practical way.\r\n\r\n\"He's going to get the chaps to turn you out.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I suspected,\" sighed Psmith, as one mourning over the frailty of\r\nhuman nature. \"About how many horny-handed assistants should you say\r\nthat he would be likely to bring? Will you, for instance, join the\r\nglad throng?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? No fear! I think Spiller's an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing like a common thought for binding people together. _I_\r\nthink Spiller's an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many _will_ there be, then?\" asked Mike.\r\n\r\n\"He might get about half a dozen, not more, because most of the chaps\r\ndon't see why they should sweat themselves just because Spiller's study\r\nhas been bagged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sturdy common sense,\" said Psmith approvingly, \"seems to be the chief\r\nvirtue of the Sedleigh character.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be able to tackle a crowd like that,\" said Mike. \"The only\r\nthing is we must get into the same dormitory.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is where Comrade Jellicoe's knowledge of the local geography will\r\ncome in useful. Do you happen to know of any snug little room, with,\r\nsay, about four beds in it? How many dormitories are there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five--there's one with three beds in it, only it belongs to three\r\nchaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe in the equal distribution of property. We will go to Comrade\r\nOutwood and stake out another claim.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Outwood received them even more beamingly than before. \"Yes, Smith?\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"We must apologize for disturbing you, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Smith, not at all! I like the boys in my house to come to\r\nme when they wish for my advice or help.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were wondering, sir, if you would have any objection to Jackson,\r\nJellicoe and myself sharing the dormitory with the three beds in it. A\r\nvery warm friendship ...\" explained Psmith, patting the gurgling\r\nJellicoe kindly on the shoulder, \"has sprung up between Jackson,\r\nJellicoe and myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You make friends easily, Smith. I like to see it--I like to see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we can have the room, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--certainly! Tell the matron as you go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Psmith, as they returned to the study, \"we may say that\r\nwe are in a fairly winning position. A vote of thanks to Comrade\r\nJellicoe for his valuable assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ a chap!\" said Jellicoe.\r\n\r\nThe handle began to revolve again.\r\n\r\n\"That door,\" said Psmith, \"is getting a perfect incubus! It cuts into\r\none's leisure cruelly.\"\r\n\r\nThis time it was a small boy. \"They told me to come up and tell you to\r\ncome down,\" he said.\r\n\r\nPsmith looked at him searchingly through his eyeglass.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"The senior day room chaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spiller?\"\r\n\r\n\"Spiller and Robinson and Stone, and some other chaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"They want us to speak to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They told me to come up and tell you to come down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and give Comrade Spiller our compliments and say that we can't come\r\ndown, but shall be delighted to see him up here. Things,\" he said, as\r\nthe messenger departed, \"are beginning to move. Better leave the door\r\nopen, I think; it will save trouble. Ah, come in, Comrade Spiller, what\r\ncan we do for you?\"\r\n\r\nSpiller advanced into the study; the others waited outside, crowding in\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Spiller, \"are you going to clear out of here or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"After Mr. Outwood's kindly thought in giving us the room? You suggest a\r\nblack and ungrateful action, Comrade Spiller.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get it hot, if you don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll risk it,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nJellicoe giggled in the background; the drama in the atmosphere appealed\r\nto him. His was a simple and appreciative mind.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, you chaps,\" cried Spiller suddenly.\r\n\r\nThere was an inward rush on the enemy's part, but Mike had been\r\nwatching. He grabbed Spiller by the shoulders and ran him back against\r\nthe advancing crowd. For a moment the doorway was blocked, then the\r\nweight and impetus of Mike and Spiller prevailed, the enemy gave back,\r\nand Mike, stepping into the room again, slammed the door and locked it.\r\n\r\n\"A neat piece of work,\" said Psmith approvingly, adjusting his tie at\r\nthe looking glass. \"The preliminaries may now be considered over, the\r\nfirst shot has been fired. The dogs of war are now loose.\"\r\n\r\nA heavy body crashed against the door.\r\n\r\n\"They'll have it down,\" said Jellicoe.\r\n\r\n\"We must act, Comrade Jackson! Might I trouble you just to turn that key\r\nquietly, and the handle, and then to stand by for the next attack.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a scrambling of feet in the passage outside, and then a\r\nrepetition of the onslaught on the door. This time, however, the door,\r\ninstead of resisting, swung open, and the human battering ram staggered\r\nthrough into the study. Mike, turning after relocking the door, was just\r\nin time to see Psmith, with a display of energy of which one would not\r\nhave believed him capable, grip the invader scientifically by an arm\r\nand a leg.\r\n\r\nMike jumped to help, but it was needless; the captive was already on the\r\nwindowsill. As Mike arrived, Psmith dropped him onto the\r\nflowerbed below.\r\n\r\nPsmith closed the window gently and turned to Jellicoe. \"Who was our\r\nguest?\" he asked, dusting the knees of his trousers where they had\r\npressed against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Robinson. I say, you _are_ a chap!\"\r\n\r\n\"Robinson, was it? Well, we are always glad to see Comrade Robinson,\r\nalways. I wonder if anybody else is thinking of calling?\"\r\n\r\nApparently frontal attack had been abandoned. Whisperings could be heard\r\nin the corridor.\r\n\r\nSomebody hammered on the door.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" called Psmith patiently.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better come out, you know; you'll only get it hotter if you\r\ndon't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave us, Spiller; we would be alone.\"\r\n\r\nA bell rang in the distance.\r\n\r\n\"Tea,\" said Jellicoe; \"we shall have to go now.\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't do anything till after tea, I shouldn't think,\" said Mike.\r\n\"There's no harm in going out.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage was empty when they opened the door; the call to food was\r\nevidently a thing not to be treated lightly by the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the dining room the beleaguered garrison were the object of general\r\nattention. Everybody turned to look at them as they came in. It was\r\nplain that the study episode had been a topic of conversation. Spiller's\r\nface was crimson, and Robinson's coat sleeve still bore traces of\r\ngarden mold.\r\n\r\nMike felt rather conscious of the eyes, but Psmith was in his element.\r\nHis demeanor throughout the meal was that of some whimsical monarch\r\ncondescending for a freak to revel with his humble subjects.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the meal Psmith scribbled a note and passed it to\r\nMike. It read: \"Directly this is over, nip upstairs as quickly as\r\nyou can.\"\r\n\r\nMike followed the advice; they were first out of the room. When they had\r\nbeen in the study a few moments, Jellicoe knocked at the door. \"Lucky\r\nyou two cut away so quick,\" he said. \"They were going to try and get you\r\ninto the senior day room and scrag you there.\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Psmith, leaning against the mantelpiece, \"is exciting, but\r\nit can't go on. We have got for our sins to be in this place for a whole\r\nterm, and if we are going to do the Hunted Fawn business all the time,\r\nlife in the true sense of the word will become an impossibility. My\r\nnerves are so delicately attuned that the strain would simply reduce\r\nthem to hash. We are not prepared to carry on a long campaign--the thing\r\nmust be settled at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go down to the senior day room, and have it out?\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"No, we will play the fixture on our own ground. I think we may take it\r\nas tolerably certain that Comrade Spiller and his hired ruffians will\r\ntry to corner us in the dormitory tonight. Well, of course, we could\r\nfake up some sort of barricade for the door, but then we should have all\r\nthe trouble over again tomorrow and the day after that. Personally I\r\ndon't propose to be chivied about indefinitely like this, so I propose\r\nthat we let them come into the dormitory, and see what happens. Is this\r\nmeeting with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that's sound,\" said Mike. \"We needn't drag Jellicoe into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact--if you don't mind ...\" began that man of peace.\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" said Psmith; \"this is not Comrade Jellicoe's scene at\r\nall; he has got to spend the term in the senior day room, whereas we\r\nhave our little wooden _châlet_ to retire to in times of stress. Comrade\r\nJellicoe must stand out of the game altogether. We shall be glad of his\r\nmoral support, but otherwise, _ne pas_. And now, as there won't be\r\nanything doing till bedtime, I think I'll collar this table and write\r\nhome and tell my people that all is well with their Rupert.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nUNPLEASANTNESS IN THE SMALL HOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nJellicoe, that human encyclopedia, consulted on the probable movements\r\nof the enemy, deposed that Spiller, retiring at ten, would make for\r\nDormitory One in the same passage, where Robinson also had a bed. The\r\nrest of the opposing forces were distributed among other and more\r\ndistant rooms. It was probable, therefore, that Dormitory One would be\r\nthe rendezvous. As to the time when an attack might be expected, it was\r\nunlikely that it would occur before half past eleven. Mr. Outwood went\r\nthe round of the dormitories at eleven.\r\n\r\n\"And touching,\" said Psmith, \"the matter of noise, must this business be\r\nconducted in a subdued and _sotto voce_ manner, or may we let ourselves\r\ngo a bit here and there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't think old Outwood's likely to hear you--he sleeps miles\r\naway on the other side of the house. He never hears anything. We often\r\nrag half the night and nothing happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"This appears to be a thoroughly nice, well-conducted establishment.\r\nWhat would my mother say if she could see her Rupert in the midst of\r\nthese reckless youths!\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better,\" said Mike; \"we don't want anybody butting in and\r\nstopping the show before it's half started.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comrade Jackson's berserk blood is up--I can hear it sizzling. I quite\r\nagree these things are all very disturbing and painful, but it's as well\r\nto do them thoroughly when one's once in for them. Is there nobody else\r\nwho might interfere with our gambols?\"\r\n\r\n\"Barnes might,\" said Jellicoe, \"only he won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is Barnes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Head of the house--a rotter. He's in a funk of Stone and Robinson; they\r\nrag him; he'll simply sit tight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I think,\" said Psmith placidly, \"we may look forward to a very\r\npleasant evening. Shall we be moving?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Outwood paid his visit at eleven, as predicted by Jellicoe, beaming\r\nvaguely into the darkness over a torch, and disappeared again,\r\nclosing the door.\r\n\r\n\"How about that door?\" said Mike. \"Shall we leave it open for them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, but far otherwise. If it's shut we shall hear them at it when\r\nthey come. Subject to your approval, Comrade Jackson, I have evolved the\r\nfollowing plan of action. I always ask myself on these occasions, 'What\r\nwould Napoleon have done?' I think Napoleon would have sat in a chair by\r\nhis washhand stand, which is close to the door; he would have posted you\r\nby your washhand stand, and he would have instructed Comrade Jellicoe,\r\ndirectly he heard the door handle turned, to give his celebrated\r\nimitation of a dormitory breathing heavily in its sleep. He\r\nwould then--\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what,\" said Mike, \"How about tying a string at the top of\r\nthe steps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Napoleon would have done that, too. Hats off to Comrade Jackson,\r\nthe man with the big brain!\"\r\n\r\nThe floor of the dormitory was below the level of the door. There were\r\nthree steps leading down to it. Psmith switched on his torch and they\r\nexamined the ground. The leg of a wardrobe and the leg of Jellicoe's bed\r\nmade it possible for the string to be fastened in a satisfactory manner\r\nacross the lower step. Psmith surveyed the result with approval.\r\n\r\n\"Dashed neat!\" he said. \"Practically the sunken road which dished the\r\nCuirassiers at Waterloo. I seem to see Comrade Spiller coming one of the\r\nfinest purlers in the world's history.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they've got a torch--\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't have. If they have, stand by and grab it at once; then\r\nthey'll charge forward and all will be well. If they have no light, fire\r\ninto the brown with a jug of water. Lest we forget, I'll collar Comrade\r\nJellicoe's jug now and keep it handy. A couple of sheets would also not\r\nbe amiss--we will enmesh the enemy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"These humane preparations being concluded,\" said Psmith, \"we will\r\nretire to our posts and wait. Comrade Jellicoe, don't forget to breathe\r\nlike an asthmatic sheep when you hear the door opened; they may wait at\r\nthe top of the steps, listening.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ a lad!\" said Jellicoe.\r\n\r\nWaiting in the dark for something to happen is always a trying\r\nexperience, especially if, as on this occasion, silence is essential.\r\nMike was tired after his journey, and he had begun to doze when he was\r\njerked back to wakefulness by the stealthy turning of the door handle;\r\nthe faintest rustle from Psmith's direction followed, and a slight\r\ngiggle, succeeded by a series of deep breaths, showed that Jellicoe,\r\ntoo, had heard the noise.\r\n\r\nThere was a creaking sound.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch-dark in the dormitory, but Mike could follow the invaders'\r\nmovements as clearly as if it had been broad daylight. They had opened\r\nthe door and were listening. Jellicoe's breathing grew more asthmatic;\r\nhe was flinging himself into his part with the wholeheartedness of the\r\ntrue artist.\r\n\r\nThe creak was followed by a sound of whispering, then another creak. The\r\nenemy had advanced to the top step.... Another creak.... The vanguard\r\nhad reached the second step.... In another moment--\r\n\r\nCRASH!\r\n\r\nAnd at that point the proceedings may be said to have formally opened.\r\n\r\nA struggling mass bumped against Mike's shins as he rose from his chair;\r\nhe emptied his jug onto this mass, and a yell of anguish showed that the\r\ncontents had got to the right address.\r\n\r\nThen a hand grabbed his ankle and he went down, a million sparks dancing\r\nbefore his eyes as a fist, flying out at a venture, caught him on\r\nthe nose.\r\n\r\nMike had not been well disposed toward the invaders before, but now he\r\nran amok, hitting out right and left at random. His right missed, but\r\nhis left went home hard on some portion of somebody's anatomy. A kick\r\nfreed his ankle and he staggered to his feet. At the same moment a\r\nsudden increase in the general volume of noise spoke eloquently of good\r\nwork that was being put in by Psmith.\r\n\r\nEven at that crisis, Mike could not help feeling that if a row of this\r\ncaliber did not draw Mr. Outwood from his bed, he must be an unusual\r\nkind of housemaster.\r\n\r\nHe plunged forward again with outstretched arms, and stumbled and fell\r\nover one of the on-the-floor section of the opposing force. They seized\r\neach other earnestly and rolled across the room till Mike, contriving to\r\nsecure his adversary's head, bumped it on the floor with such abandon\r\nthat, with a muffled yell, the other let go, and for the second time he\r\nrose. As he did so he was conscious of a curious thudding sound that\r\nmade itself heard through the other assorted noises of the battle.\r\n\r\nAll this time the fight had gone on in the blackest darkness, but now a\r\nlight shone on the proceedings. Interested occupants of other\r\ndormitories, roused from their slumbers, had come to observe the sport.\r\nThey had switched on the light and were crowding in the doorway.\r\n\r\nBy the light of this Mike got a swift view of the theater of war. The\r\nenemy appeared to number five. The warrior whose head Mike had bumped on\r\nthe floor was Robinson, who was sitting up feeling his skull in a\r\ngingerly fashion. To Mike's right, almost touching him, was Stone. In\r\nthe direction of the door, Psmith, wielding in his right hand the cord\r\nof a dressing gown, was engaging the remaining three with a\r\npatient smile.\r\n\r\nThey were clad in pajamas, and appeared to be feeling the dressing-gown\r\ncord acutely.\r\n\r\nThe sudden light dazed both sides momentarily. The defense was the first\r\nto recover, Mike, with a swing, upsetting Stone, and Psmith, having\r\nseized and emptied Jellicoe's jug over Spiller, getting to work again\r\nwith the cord in a manner that roused the utmost enthusiasm of the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nAgility seemed to be the leading feature of Psmith's tactics. He was\r\neverywhere--on Mike's bed, on his own, on Jellicoe's (drawing a\r\npassionate complaint from that noncombatant, on whose face he\r\ninadvertently trod), on the floor--he ranged the room, sowing\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were disheartened; they had started with the idea that this\r\nwas to be a surprise attack, and it was disconcerting to find the\r\ngarrison armed at all points. Gradually they edged to the door, and a\r\nfinal rush sent them through.\r\n\r\n\"Hold the door for a second,\" cried Psmith, and vanished. Mike was alone\r\nin the doorway.\r\n\r\nIt was a situation which exactly suited his frame of mind; he stood\r\nalone in direct opposition to the community into which Fate had\r\npitchforked him so abruptly. He liked the feeling; for the first time\r\nsince his father had given him his views upon school reports that\r\nmorning in the Easter holidays, he felt satisfied with life. He hoped,\r\noutnumbered as he was, that the enemy would come on again and not give\r\nthe thing up in disgust; he wanted more.\r\n\r\nOn an occasion like this there is rarely anything approaching concerted\r\naction on the part of the aggressors. When the attack came, it was not a\r\ncombined attack; Stone, who was nearest to the door, made a sudden dash\r\nforward, and Mike hit him under the chin.\r\n\r\nStone drew back, and there was another interval for rest and reflection.\r\n\r\nIt was interrupted by the reappearance of Psmith, who strolled back\r\nalong the passage swinging his dressing-gown cord as if it were some\r\nclouded cane.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting, Comrade Jackson,\" he said politely. \"Duty\r\ncalled me elsewhere. With the kindly aid of a guide who knows the lie of\r\nthe land, I have been making a short tour of the dormitories. I have\r\npoured divers jugfuls of water over Comrade Spiller's bed, Comrade\r\nRobinson's bed, Comrade Stone's--Spiller, Spiller, these are harsh\r\nwords; where you pick them up I can't think--not from me. Well, well, I\r\nsuppose there must be an end to the pleasantest of functions. Good\r\nnight, good night.\"\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind Mike and himself. For ten minutes shufflings and\r\nwhisperings went on in the corridor, but nobody touched the handle.\r\n\r\nThen there was a sound of retreating footsteps, and silence reigned.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning there was a notice on the house board. It ran:\r\n\r\n  INDOOR GAMES\r\n\r\n  _Dormitory raiders are informed that in future neither Mr. Psmith\r\n  nor Mr. Jackson will be at home to visitors. This nuisance must now\r\n  cease._\r\n\r\n  R. PSMITH.\r\n  M. JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nADAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same morning Mike met Adair for the first time.\r\n\r\nHe was going across to school with Psmith and Jellicoe, when a group of\r\nthree came out of the gate of the house next door.\r\n\r\n\"That's Adair,\" said Jellicoe, \"in the middle.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice had assumed a tone almost of awe.\r\n\r\n\"Who's Adair?\" asked Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Captain of cricket, and lots of other things.\"\r\n\r\nMike could only see the celebrity's back. He had broad shoulders and\r\nwiry, light hair, almost white. He walked well, as if he were used to\r\nrunning. Altogether a fit-looking sort of man. Even Mike's jaundiced\r\neye saw that.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Adair deserved more than a casual glance. He was\r\nthat rare type, the natural leader. Many boys and men, if accident, or\r\nthe passage of time, places them in a position where they are expected\r\nto lead, can handle the job without disaster; but that is a very\r\ndifferent thing from being a born leader. Adair was of the sort that\r\ncomes to the top by sheer force of character and determination. He was\r\nnot naturally clever at work, but he had gone at it with a dogged\r\nresolution which had carried him up the school, and landed him high in\r\nthe Sixth. As a cricketer he was almost entirely self-taught. Nature had\r\ngiven him a good eye, and left the thing at that. Adair's doggedness had\r\ntriumphed over her failure to do her work thoroughly. At the cost of\r\nmore trouble than most people give to their life work he had made\r\nhimself into a bowler. He read the authorities, and watched first-class\r\nplayers, and thought the thing out on his own account, and he divided\r\nthe art of bowling into three sections. First, and most\r\nimportant--pitch. Second on the list--break. Third--pace. He set himself\r\nto acquire pitch. He acquired it. Bowling at his own pace and without\r\nany attempt at break, he could now drop the ball on an envelope seven\r\ntimes out of ten.\r\n\r\nBreak was a more uncertain quantity. Sometimes he could get it at the\r\nexpense of pitch, sometimes at the expense of pace. Some days he could\r\nget all three, and then he was an uncommonly bad man to face on anything\r\nbut a plumb wicket.\r\n\r\nRunning he had acquired in a similar manner. He had nothing approaching\r\nstyle, but he had twice won the mile and half mile at the Sports off\r\nelegant runners, who knew all about stride and the correct timing of the\r\nsprints and all the rest of it.\r\n\r\nBriefly, he was a worker. He had heart.\r\n\r\nA boy of Adair's type is always a force in a school. In a big public\r\nschool or six or seven hundred, his influence is felt less; but in a\r\nsmall school like Sedleigh he is like a tidal wave, sweeping all before\r\nhim. There were two hundred boys at Sedleigh, and there was not one of\r\nthem in all probability who had not, directly or indirectly, been\r\ninfluenced by Adair. As a small boy his sphere was not large, but the\r\neffects of his work began to be apparent even then. It is human nature\r\nto want to get something which somebody else obviously values very much;\r\nand when it was observed by members of his form that Adair was going to\r\ngreat trouble and inconvenience to secure a place in the form eleven or\r\nfifteen, they naturally began to think, too, that it was worth being in\r\nthose teams. The consequence was that his form always played hard. This\r\nmade other forms play hard. And the net result was that, when Adair\r\nsucceeded to the captaincy of Rugger and cricket in the same year,\r\nSedleigh, as Mr. Downing, Adair's housemaster and the nearest approach\r\nto a cricket master that Sedleigh possessed, had a fondness for saying,\r\nwas a keen school. As a whole, it both worked and played with energy.\r\n\r\nAll it wanted now was opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis Adair was determined to give it. He had that passionate fondness\r\nfor his school which every boy is popularly supposed to have, but which\r\nreally is implanted in about one in every thousand. The average\r\npublic-school boy _likes_ his school. He hopes it will lick Bedford at\r\nRugger and Malvern at cricket, but he rather bets it won't. He is sorry\r\nto leave, and he likes going back at the end of the holidays, but as for\r\nany passionate, deep-seated love of the place, he would think it rather\r\nbad form than otherwise. If anybody came up to him, slapped him on the\r\nback, and cried, \"Come along, Jenkins, my boy! Play up for the old\r\nschool, Jenkins! The dear old school! The old place you love so!\" he\r\nwould feel seriously ill.\r\n\r\nAdair was the exception.\r\n\r\nTo Adair, Sedleigh was almost a religion. Both his parents were dead;\r\nhis guardian, with whom he spent the holidays, was a man with neuralgia\r\nat one end of him and gout at the other; and the only really pleasant\r\ntimes Adair had had, as far back as he could remember, he owed to\r\nSedleigh. The place had grown on him, absorbed him. Where Mike,\r\nviolently transplanted from Wrykyn, saw only a wretched little hole not\r\nto be mentioned in the same breath with Wrykyn, Adair, dreaming of the\r\nfuture, saw a colossal establishment, a public school among public\r\nschools, a lump of human radium, shooting out Blues and Balliol Scholars\r\nyear after year without ceasing.\r\n\r\nIt would not be so till long after he was gone and forgotten, but he did\r\nnot mind that. His devotion to Sedleigh was purely unselfish. He did not\r\nwant fame. All he worked for was that the school should grow and grow,\r\nkeener and better at games and more prosperous year by year, till it\r\nshould take its rank among _the_ schools, and to be an Old Sedleighan\r\nshould be a badge passing its owner everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"He's captain of cricket and Rugger,\" said Jellicoe impressively. \"He's\r\nin the shooting eight. He's won the mile and half mile two years\r\nrunning. He would have boxed at Aldershot last term, only he sprained\r\nhis wrist. And he plays fives jolly well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sort of little tin god,\" said Mike, taking a violent dislike to Adair\r\nfrom that moment.\r\n\r\nMike's actual acquaintance with this all-round man dated from the dinner\r\nhour that day. Mike was walking to the house with Psmith. Psmith was a\r\nlittle ruffled on account of a slight passage-of-arms he had had with\r\nhis form master during morning school.\r\n\r\n\"'There's a P before the Smith,' I said to him. 'Ah, P. Smith, I see,'\r\nreplied the goat. 'Not Peasmith,' I replied, exercising wonderful\r\nself-restraint, 'just Psmith.' It took me ten minutes to drive the thing\r\ninto the man's head; and when I _had_ driven it in, he sent me out of\r\nthe room for looking at him through my eyeglass. Comrade Jackson, I fear\r\nme we have fallen among bad men. I suspect that we are going to be much\r\npersecuted by scoundrels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Both you chaps play cricket, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nThey turned. It was Adair. Seeing him face to face, Mike was aware of a\r\npair of very bright blue eyes and a square jaw. In any other place and\r\nmood he would have liked Adair at sight. His prejudice, however, against\r\nall things Sedleighan was too much for him. \"I don't,\" he said shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you _ever_ played?\"\r\n\r\n\"My little sister and I sometimes play with a soft ball at home.\"\r\n\r\nAdair looked sharply at him. A temper was evidently one of his numerous\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, perhaps you wouldn't mind turning out this\r\nafternoon and seeing what you can do with a hard ball--if you can manage\r\nwithout your little sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think the form at this place would be about on a level with\r\nhers. But I don't happen to be playing cricket, as I think I told you.\"\r\n\r\nAdair's jaw grew squarer than ever. Mike was wearing a gloomy scowl.\r\n\r\nPsmith joined suavely in the dialogue.\r\n\r\n\"My dear old comrades,\" he said, \"Don't let us brawl over this matter.\r\nThis is a time for the honeyed word, the kindly eye, and the pleasant\r\nsmile. Let me explain to Comrade Adair. Speaking for Comrade Jackson and\r\nmyself, we should both be delighted to join in the mimic warfare of our\r\nNational Game, as you suggest, only the fact is, we happen to be the\r\nYoung Archaeologists. We gave in our names last night. When you are\r\nbeing carried back to the pavilion after your century against\r\nLoamshire--do you play Loamshire?--we shall be grubbing in the hard\r\nground for ruined abbeys. The old choice between Pleasure and Duty,\r\nComrade Adair. A Boy's Crossroads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you won't play?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Archaeology,\" said Psmith, with a deprecatory wave of the hand, \"will\r\nbrook no divided allegiance from her devotees.\"\r\n\r\nAdair turned, and walked on.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he gone, when another voice hailed them with precisely the\r\nsame question.\r\n\r\n\"Both you fellows are going to play cricket, eh?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a master. A short, wiry little man with a sharp nose and a\r\ngeneral resemblance, both in manner and appearance, to an excitable\r\nbullfinch.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Adair speaking to you. I suppose you will both play. I like every\r\nnew boy to begin at once. The more new blood we have, the better. We\r\nwant keenness here. We are, above all, a keen school. I want every boy\r\nto be keen.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are, sir,\" said Psmith, with fervor.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent.\"\r\n\r\n\"On archaeology.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing--for it was no less a celebrity--started, as one who\r\nperceives a loathly caterpillar in his salad.\r\n\r\n\"Archaeology!\"\r\n\r\n\"We gave in our names to Mr. Outwood last night, sir. Archaeology is a\r\npassion with us, sir. When we heard that there was a society here, we\r\nwent singing about the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I call it an unnatural pursuit for boys,\" said Mr. Downing vehemently.\r\n\"I don't like it. I tell you I don't like it. It is not for me to\r\ninterfere with one of my colleagues on the staff, but I tell you frankly\r\nthat in my opinion it is an abominable waste of time for a boy. It gets\r\nhim into idle, loafing habits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never loaf, sir,\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"I was not alluding to you in particular. I was referring to the\r\nprinciple of the thing. A boy ought to be playing cricket with other\r\nboys, not wandering at large about the country, probably smoking and\r\ngoing into low public houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very wild lot, sir, I fear, the Archaeological Society here,\" sighed\r\nPsmith, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"If you choose to waste your time, I suppose I can't hinder you. But in\r\nmy opinion it is foolery, nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nHe stumped off.\r\n\r\n\"Now _he's_ cross,\" said Psmith, looking after him. \"I'm afraid we're\r\ngetting ourselves disliked here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good job, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, Comrade Outwood loves us. Let's go on and see what sort of\r\na lunch that large-hearted fossil fancier is going to give us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nMIKE FINDS OCCUPATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was more than one moment during the first fortnight of term when\r\nMike found himself regretting the attitude he had imposed upon himself\r\nwith regard to Sedleighan cricket. He began to realize the eternal truth\r\nof the proverb about half a loaf and no bread. In the first flush of his\r\nresentment against his new surroundings he had refused to play cricket.\r\nAnd now he positively ached for a game. Any sort of a game. An innings\r\nfor a Kindergarten _v_. the Second Eleven of a Home of Rest for\r\nCentenarians would have soothed him. There were times, when the sun\r\nshone, and he caught sight of white flannels on a green ground, and\r\nheard the \"plonk\" of bat striking ball, when he felt like rushing to\r\nAdair and shouting, \"I _will_ be good. I was in the Wrykyn team three\r\nyears, and had an average of over fifty the last two seasons. Lead me to\r\nthe nearest net, and let me feel a bat in my hands again.\"\r\n\r\nBut every time he shrank from such a climb down. It couldn't be done.\r\n\r\nWhat made it worse was that he saw, after watching behind the nets once\r\nor twice, that Sedleigh cricket was not the childish burlesque of the\r\ngame which he had been rash enough to assume that it must be. Numbers do\r\nnot make good cricket. They only make the presence of good cricketers\r\nmore likely, by the law of averages.\r\n\r\nMike soon saw that cricket was by no means an unknown art at Sedleigh.\r\nAdair, to begin with, was a very good bowler indeed. He was not a\r\nBurgess, but Burgess was the only Wrykyn bowler whom, in his three\r\nyears' experience of the school, Mike would have placed above him. He\r\nwas a long way better than Neville-Smith, and Wyatt, and Milton, and the\r\nothers who had taken wickets for Wrykyn.\r\n\r\nThe batting was not so good, but there were some quite capable men.\r\nBarnes, the head of Outwood's, he who preferred not to interfere with\r\nStone and Robinson, was a mild, rather timid-looking youth--not unlike\r\nwhat Mr. Outwood must have been as a boy--but he knew how to keep balls\r\nout of his wicket. He was a good bat of the old plodding type.\r\n\r\nStone and Robinson themselves, that swashbuckling pair, who now treated\r\nMike and Psmith with cold but consistent politeness, were both fair\r\nbatsmen, and Stone was a good slow bowler.\r\n\r\nThere were other exponents of the game, mostly in Downing's house.\r\n\r\nAltogether, quite worthy colleagues even for a man who had been a star\r\nat Wrykyn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne solitary overture Mike made during that first fortnight. He did not\r\nrepeat the experiment.\r\n\r\nIt was on a Thursday afternoon, after school. The day was warm, but\r\nfreshened by an almost imperceptible breeze. The air was full of the\r\nscent of the cut grass which lay in little heaps behind the nets. This\r\nis the real cricket scent, which calls to one like the very voice of\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\nMike, as he sat there watching, could stand it no longer.\r\n\r\nHe went up to Adair.\r\n\r\n\"May I have an innings at this net?\" he asked. He was embarrassed and\r\nnervous, and was trying not to show it. The natural result was that his\r\nmanner was offensively abrupt.\r\n\r\nAdair was taking off his pads after his innings. He looked up. \"This\r\nnet,\" it may be observed, was the first eleven net.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he said.\r\n\r\nMike repeated his request. More abruptly this time, from increased\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"This is the first eleven net,\" said Adair coldly. \"Go in after Lodge\r\nover there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over there\" was the end net, where frenzied novices were bowling on a\r\ncorrugated pitch to a red-haired youth with enormous feet, who looked as\r\nif he were taking his first lesson at the game.\r\n\r\nMike walked away without a word.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Archaeological Society expeditions, even though they carried with\r\nthem the privilege of listening to Psmith's views of life, proved but a\r\npoor substitute for cricket. Psmith, who had no counterattraction\r\nshouting to him that he ought to be elsewhere, seemed to enjoy them\r\nhugely, but Mike almost cried sometimes from boredom. It was not always\r\npossible to slip away from the throng, for Mr. Outwood evidently looked\r\nupon them as among the very faithful, and kept them by his side.\r\n\r\nMike on these occasions was silent and jumpy, his brow \"sicklied o'er\r\nwith the pale cast of care.\" But Psmith followed his leader with the\r\npleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son is showing him\r\nround the garden. Psmith's attitude toward archaeological research\r\nstruck a new note in the history of that neglected science. He was\r\namiable, but patronizing. He patronized fossils, and he patronized\r\nruins. If he had been confronted with the Great Pyramid, he would have\r\npatronized that.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be consumed by a thirst for knowledge.\r\n\r\nThat this was not altogether a genuine thirst was proved in the third\r\nexpedition. Mr. Outwood and his band were pecking away at the site of an\r\nold Roman camp. Psmith approached Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Having inspired confidence,\" he said, \"by the docility of our demeanor,\r\nlet us slip away, and brood apart for awhile. Roman camps, to be\r\nabsolutely accurate, give me the pip. And I never want to see another\r\nputrid fossil in my life. Let us find some shady nook where a man may\r\nlie on his back for a bit.\"\r\n\r\nMike, over whom the proceedings connected with the Roman camp had long\r\nsince begun to shed a blue depression, offered no opposition, and they\r\nstrolled away down the hill.\r\n\r\nLooking back, they saw that the archaeologists were still hard at it.\r\nTheir departure had passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\"A fatiguing pursuit, this grubbing for mementos of the past,\" said\r\nPsmith. \"And, above all, dashed bad for the knees of the trousers. Mine\r\nare like some furrowed field. It's a great grief to a man of refinement,\r\nI can tell you, Comrade Jackson. Ah, this looks a likely spot.\"\r\n\r\nThey had passed through a gate into the field beyond. At the farther end\r\nthere was a brook, shaded by trees and running with a pleasant sound\r\nover pebbles.\r\n\r\n\"Thus far,\" said Psmith, hitching up the knees of his trousers, and\r\nsitting down, \"and no farther. We will rest here awhile, and listen to\r\nthe music of the brook. In fact, unless you have anything important to\r\nsay, I rather think I'll go to sleep. In this busy life of ours these\r\nnaps by the wayside are invaluable. Call me in about an hour.\" And\r\nPsmith, heaving the comfortable sigh of the worker who by toil has\r\nearned rest, lay down, with his head against a mossy tree stump, and\r\nclosed his eyes.\r\n\r\nMike sat on for a few minutes, listening to the water and making\r\ncenturies in his mind, and then, finding this a little dull, he got up,\r\njumped the brook, and began to explore the wood on the other side.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone many yards when a dog emerged suddenly from the\r\nundergrowth, and began to bark vigorously at him.\r\n\r\nMike liked dogs, and, on acquaintance, they always liked him. But when\r\nyou meet a dog in someone else's wood, it is as well not to stop in\r\norder that you may get to understand each other. Mike began to thread\r\nhis way back through the trees.\r\n\r\nHe was too late.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! What the dickens are you doing here?\" shouted a voice behind him.\r\n\r\nIn the same situation a few years before, Mike would have carried on,\r\nand trusted to speed to save him. But now there seemed a lack of dignity\r\nin the action. He came back to where the man was standing.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry if I'm trespassing,\" he said. \"I was just having a look\r\nround.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dickens you--Why, you're Jackson!\"\r\n\r\nMike looked at him. He was a short, broad young man with a fair\r\nmoustache. Mike knew that he had seen him before somewhere, but he could\r\nnot place him.\r\n\r\n\"I played against you, for the Free Foresters last summer. In passing\r\nyou seem to be a bit of a free forester yourself, dancing in among my\r\nnesting pheasants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm frightfully sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right. Where do you spring from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course--I remember you now. You're Prendergast. You made fifty-eight\r\nnot out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. I was afraid the only thing you would remember about me was\r\nthat you took a century mostly off my bowling.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have had me second ball, only cover dropped it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't rake up forgotten tragedies. How is it you're not at Wrykyn? What\r\nare you doing down here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've left Wrykyn.\"\r\n\r\nPrendergast suddenly changed the conversation. When a fellow tells you\r\nthat he has left school unexpectedly, it is not always tactful to\r\ninquire the reason. He began to talk about himself.\r\n\r\n\"I hang out down here. I do a little farming and a good deal of\r\nputtering about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get any cricket?\" asked Mike, turning to the subject next his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Only village. Very keen, but no great shakes. By the way, how are you\r\noff for cricket now? Have you ever got a spare afternoon?\"\r\n\r\nMike's heart leaped.\r\n\r\n\"Any Wednesday or Saturday. Look here, I'll tell you how it is.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he told how matters stood with him.\r\n\r\n\"So, you see,\" he concluded, \"I'm supposed to be hunting for ruins and\r\nthings\"--Mike's ideas on the subject of archaeology were vague--\"but I\r\ncould always slip away. We all start out together, but I could nip back,\r\nget onto my bike--I've got it down here--and meet you anywhere you\r\nliked. By Jove, I'm simply dying for a game. I can hardly keep my hands\r\noff a bat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you all you want. What you'd better do is to ride straight to\r\nLower Borlock--that's the name of the place--and I'll meet you on the\r\nground. Anyone will tell you where Lower Borlock is. It's just off the\r\nLondon road. There's a signpost where you turn off. Can you come next\r\nSaturday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather. I suppose you can fix me up with a bat and pads? I don't want\r\nto bring mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll lend you everything. I say, you know, we can't give you a Wrykyn\r\nwicket. The Lower Borlock pitch isn't a shirt front.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll play on a rockery, if you want me to,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You're going to what?\" asked Psmith, sleepily, on being awakened and\r\ntold the news.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to play cricket, for a village near here. I say, don't tell a\r\nsoul, will you? I don't want it to get about, or I may get lugged in to\r\nplay for the school.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lips are sealed. I think I'll come and watch you. Cricket I dislike,\r\nbut watching cricket is one of the finest of Britain's manly sports.\r\nI'll borrow Jellicoe's bicycle.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat Saturday, Lower Borlock smote the men of Chidford hip and thigh.\r\nTheir victory was due to a hurricane innings of seventy-five by a\r\nnewcomer to the team, M. Jackson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nCricket is the great safety valve. If you like the game, and are in a\r\nposition to play it at least twice a week, life can never be entirely\r\ngray. As time went on, and his average for Lower Borlock reached the\r\nfifties and stayed there, Mike began, though he would not have admitted\r\nit, to enjoy himself. It was not Wrykyn, but it was a very decent\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\nThe only really considerable element making for discomfort now was Mr.\r\nDowning. By bad luck it was in his form that Mike had been placed on\r\narrival; and Mr. Downing, never an easy form master to get on with,\r\nproved more than usually difficult in his dealings with Mike.\r\n\r\nThey had taken a dislike to each other at their first meeting; and it\r\ngrew with further acquaintance. To Mike, Mr. Downing was all that a\r\nmaster ought not to be, fussy, pompous, and openly influenced in his\r\nofficial dealings with his form by his own private likes and dislikes.\r\nTo Mr. Downing, Mike was simply an unamiable loafer, who did nothing for\r\nthe school and apparently had none of the healthy instincts which should\r\nbe implanted in the healthy boy. Mr. Downing was rather strong on the\r\nhealthy boy.\r\n\r\nThe two lived in a state of simmering hostility, punctuated at intervals\r\nby crises, which usually resulted in Lower Borlock having to play some\r\nunskilled laborer in place of their star batsman, employed doing\r\n\"overtime.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most acute of these crises, and the most important, in that\r\nit was the direct cause of Mike's appearance in Sedleigh cricket, had to\r\ndo with the third weekly meeting of the School Fire Brigade.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that this well-supported institution was under Mr.\r\nDowning's special care. It was, indeed, his pet hobby and the apple\r\nof his eye.\r\n\r\nJust as you had to join the Archaeological Society to secure the esteem\r\nof Mr. Outwood, so to become a member of the Fire Brigade was a safe\r\npassport to the regard of Mr. Downing. To show a keenness for cricket\r\nwas good, but to join the Fire Brigade was best of all.\r\n\r\nThe Brigade was carefully organized. At its head was Mr. Downing, a sort\r\nof high priest; under him was a captain, and under the captain a\r\nvice-captain. These two officials were those sportive allies, Stone and\r\nRobinson, of Outwood's house, who, having perceived at a very early date\r\nthe gorgeous opportunities for ragging which the Brigade offered to its\r\nmembers, had joined young and worked their way up.\r\n\r\nUnder them were the rank and file, about thirty in all, of whom perhaps\r\nseven were earnest workers, who looked on the Brigade in the right, or\r\nDowning, spirit. The rest were entirely frivolous.\r\n\r\nThe weekly meetings were always full of life and excitement.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is as well to introduce Sammy to the reader.\r\n\r\nSammy, short for Sampson, was a young bull terrier belonging to Mr.\r\nDowning. If it is possible for a man to have two apples of his eye,\r\nSammy was the other. He was a large, lighthearted dog with a white coat,\r\nan engaging expression, the tongue of an anteater, and a manner which\r\nwas a happy blend of hurricane and circular saw. He had long legs, a\r\ntenor voice, and was apparently made of India rubber.\r\n\r\nSammy was a great favorite in the school, and a particular friend of\r\nMike's, the Wrykynian being always a firm ally of every dog he met after\r\ntwo minutes' acquaintance.\r\n\r\nIn passing, Jellicoe owned a clockwork rat, much in request during\r\nFrench lessons.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to the painful details.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the Fire Brigade were held after school in Mr. Downing's\r\nform room. The proceedings always began in the same way, by the reading\r\nof the minutes of the last meeting. After that the entertainment varied\r\naccording to whether the members happened to be fertile or not in ideas\r\nfor the disturbing of the peace.\r\n\r\nToday they were in very fair form.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mr. Downing had closed the minute book, Wilson, of the School\r\nHouse, held up his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, couldn't we have a uniform for the Brigade?\"\r\n\r\n\"A uniform?\" Mr. Downing pondered.\r\n\r\n\"Red, with green stripes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nRed, with a thin green stripe, was the Sedleigh color.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I put it to the vote, sir?\" asked Stone.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, Stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those in favor of the motion move to the left, those against it to the\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nA scuffling of feet, a slamming of desk lids and an upset blackboard,\r\nand the meeting had divided.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing rapped irritably on his desk.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down!\" he said. \"Sit down! I won't have this noise and disturbance.\r\nStone, sit down--Wilson, get back to your place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, the motion is carried by twenty-five votes to six.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, may I go and get measured this evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"Si-_lence!_ The idea of a uniform is, of course, out of the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be _quiet!_ Entirely out of the question. We cannot plunge into\r\nneedless expense. Stone, listen to me. I cannot have this noise and\r\ndisturbance! Another time when a point arises it must be settled by a\r\nshow of hands. Well, Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, may we have helmets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very useful as a protection against falling timbers, sir,\" said\r\nRobinson.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think my people would be pleased, sir, if they knew I was going\r\nout to fires without a helmet,\" said Stone.\r\n\r\nThe whole strength of the company: \"Please, sir, may we have helmets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those in favor ...\" began Stone.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing banged on his desk. \"Silence! Silence!! Silence!!! Helmets\r\nare, of course, perfectly preposterous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, the danger!\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, the falling timbers!\"\r\n\r\nThe Fire Brigade had been in action once and once only in the memory of\r\nman, and that time it was a haystack which had burned itself out just as\r\nthe rescuers had succeeded in fastening the hose to the hydrant.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, please, sir, couldn't we have an honor cap? It wouldn't be\r\nexpensive, and it would be just as good as a helmet for all the timbers\r\nthat are likely to fall on our heads.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing smiled a wry smile.\r\n\r\n\"Our Wilson is facetious,\" he remarked frostily.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, no, sir! I wasn't facetious! Or couldn't we have tasseled caps\r\nlike the first fifteen have? They--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilson, leave the room!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, _please_, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"This moment, Wilson. And,\" as he reached the door, \"do me one hundred\r\nlines.\"\r\n\r\nA pained \"OO-oo-oo, sir-r-r,\" was cut off by the closing door.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing proceeded to improve the occasion. \"I deplore this growing\r\nspirit of flippancy,\" he said. \"I tell you I deplore it! It is not\r\nright! If this Fire Brigade is to be of solid use, there must be less of\r\nthis flippancy. We must have keenness. I want you boys above all to be\r\nkeen. I...? What is that noise?\"\r\n\r\nFrom the other side of the door proceeded a sound like water gurgling\r\nfrom a bottle, mingled with cries half suppressed, as if somebody were\r\nbeing prevented from uttering them by a hand laid over his mouth. The\r\nsufferer appeared to have a high voice.\r\n\r\nThere was a tap at the door and Mike walked in. He was not alone. Those\r\nnear enough to see, saw that he was accompanied by Jellicoe's clockwork\r\nrat, which moved rapidly over the floor in the direction of the\r\nopposite wall.\r\n\r\n\"May I fetch a book from my desk, sir?\" asked Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Very well--be quick, Jackson; we are busy.\"\r\n\r\nBeing interrupted in one of his addresses to the Brigade irritated Mr.\r\nDowning.\r\n\r\nThe muffled cries grew more distinct.\r\n\r\n\"What ... is ... that ... noise?\" shrilled Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"Noise, sir?\" asked Mike, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's something outside the window, sir,\" said Stone helpfully.\r\n\r\n\"A bird, I think, sir,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be absurd!\" snapped Mr. Downing. \"It's outside the door. Wilson!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" said a voice \"off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you making that whining noise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whining noise, sir? No, sir, I'm not making a whining noise.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _sort_ of noise, sir?\" inquired Mike, as many Wrykynians had asked\r\nbefore him. It was a question invented by Wrykyn for use in just such a\r\ncase as this.\r\n\r\n\"I do not propose,\" said Mr. Downing acidly, \"to imitate the noise; you\r\ncan all hear it perfectly plainly. It is a curious whining noise.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are mowing the cricket field, sir,\" said the invisible Wilson.\r\n\"Perhaps that's it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be one of the desks squeaking, sir,\" put in Stone. \"They do\r\nsometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or somebody's shoes, sir,\" added Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"Silence! Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" bellowed the unseen one.\r\n\r\n\"Don't shout at me from the corridor like that. Come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the muffled whining changed suddenly to a series of tenor\r\nshrieks, and the India-rubber form of Sammy bounded into the room like\r\nan excited kangaroo.\r\n\r\nWilling hands had by this time deflected the clockwork rat from the wall\r\nto which it had been steering, and pointed it up the alleyway between\r\nthe two rows of desks. Mr. Downing, rising from his place, was just in\r\ntime to see Sammy with a last leap spring on his prey and begin\r\nworrying it.\r\n\r\nChaos reigned.\r\n\r\n\"A rat!\" shouted Robinson.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-three members of the Brigade who were not earnest instantly\r\ndealt with the situation, each in the manner that seemed proper to him.\r\nSome leaped onto forms, others flung books, all shouted. It was a\r\nstirring, bustling scene.\r\n\r\nSammy had by this time disposed of the clockwork rat, and was now\r\nstanding, like Marius, among the ruins barking triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe banging on Mr. Downing's desk resembled thunder. It rose above all\r\nthe other noises till in time they gave up the competition and\r\ndied away.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing shot out orders, threats, and penalties with the rapidity of\r\na Bren gun.\r\n\r\n\"Stone, sit down! Donovan, if you do not sit down you will be severely\r\npunished. Henderson, one hundred lines for gross disorder! Windham, the\r\nsame! Go to your seat, Vincent. What are you doing, Broughton-Knight? I\r\nwill not have this disgraceful noise and disorder! The meeting is at an\r\nend; go quietly from the room, all of you. Jackson and Wilson, remain.\r\n_Quietly_, I said, Durand! Don't shuffle your feet in that\r\nabominable way.\"\r\n\r\nCrash!\r\n\r\n\"Wolferstan, I distinctly saw you upset that blackboard with a movement\r\nof your hand--one hundred lines. Go quietly from the room, everybody.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting dispersed.\r\n\r\n\"Jackson and Wilson, come here. What's the meaning of this disgraceful\r\nconduct? Put that dog out of the room, Jackson.\"\r\n\r\nMike removed the yelling Sammy and shut the door on him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, I was playing with a clockwork rat--\"\r\n\r\n\"What business have you to be playing with clockwork rats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I remembered,\" said Mike, \"that I had left my Horace in my desk,\r\nso I came in--\"\r\n\r\n\"And by a fluke, sir,\" said Wilson, as one who tells of strange things,\r\n\"the rat happened to be pointing in the same direction, so he came\r\nin, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I met Sammy on the gravel outside and he followed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tried to collar him, but when you told me to come in, sir, I had to\r\nlet him go, and he came in after the rat.\"\r\n\r\nIt was plain to Mr. Downing that the burden of sin was shared equally by\r\nboth culprits. Wilson had supplied the rat, Mike the dog; but Mr.\r\nDowning liked Wilson and disliked Mike. Wilson was in the Fire Brigade,\r\nfrivolous at times, it was true, but nevertheless a member. Also he kept\r\nwicket for the school. Mike was a member of the Archaeological Society,\r\nand had refused to play cricket.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing allowed these facts to influence him in passing sentence.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred lines, Wilson,\" he said. \"You may go.\"\r\n\r\nWilson departed with the air of a man who has had a great deal of fun,\r\nand paid very little for it.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing turned to Mike. \"You will stay in on Saturday afternoon,\r\nJackson; it will interfere with your Archaeological studies, I fear, but\r\nit may teach you that we have no room at Sedleigh for boys who spend\r\ntheir time loafing about and making themselves a nuisance. We are a keen\r\nschool; this is no place for boys who do nothing but waste their time.\r\nThat will do, Jackson.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Downing walked out of the room. In affairs of this kind a master\r\nhas a habit of getting the last word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nACHILLES LEAVES HIS TENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThey say misfortunes never come singly. As Mike sat brooding over his\r\nwrongs in his study, after the Sammy incident, Jellicoe came into the\r\nroom, and, without preamble, asked for the loan of a pound.\r\n\r\nWhen one has been in the habit of confining one's lendings and\r\nborrowings to sixpences and shillings, a request for a pound comes as\r\nsomething of a blow.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth for?\" asked Mike.\r\n\r\n\"I say, do you mind if I don't tell you? I don't want to tell anybody.\r\nThe fact is, I'm in a beastly hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" said Mike. \"As a matter of fact, I do happen to have a\r\nquid. You can freeze on to it, if you like. But it's about all I have\r\ngot, so don't be shy about paying it back.\"\r\n\r\nJellicoe was profuse in his thanks, and disappeared in a cloud of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nMike felt that Fate was treating him badly. Being kept in on Saturday\r\nmeant that he would be unable to turn out for Little Borlock against\r\nClaythorpe, the return match. In the previous game he had scored\r\nninety-eight, and there was a lob bowler in the Claythorpe ranks whom he\r\nwas particularly anxious to meet again. Having to yield a sovereign to\r\nJellicoe--why on earth did the man want all that?--meant that, unless a\r\ncarefully worded letter to his brother Bob at Oxford had the desired\r\neffect, he would be practically penniless for weeks.\r\n\r\nIn a gloomy frame of mind he sat down to write to Bob, who was playing\r\nregularly for the Varsity this season, and only the previous week had\r\nmade a century against Sussex, so might be expected to be in a\r\nsufficiently softened mood to advance the needful. (Which, it may be\r\nstated at once, he did, by return of post.)\r\n\r\nMike was struggling with the opening sentences of this letter--he was\r\nnever a very ready writer--when Stone and Robinson burst into the room.\r\n\r\nMike put down his pen, and got up. He was in warlike mood, and welcomed\r\nthe intrusion. If Stone and Robinson wanted battle, they should have it.\r\n\r\nBut the motives of the expedition were obviously friendly. Stone beamed.\r\nRobinson was laughing.\r\n\r\n\"You're a sportsman,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"What did he give you?\" asked Stone.\r\n\r\nThey sat down, Robinson on the table, Stone in Psmith's deck chair.\r\nMike's heart warmed to them. The little disturbance in the dormitory was\r\na thing of the past, done with, forgotten, contemporary with Julius\r\nCaesar. He felt that he, Stone and Robinson must learn to know and\r\nappreciate one another.\r\n\r\nThere was, as a matter of fact, nothing much wrong with Stone and\r\nRobinson. They were just ordinary raggers of the type found at every\r\npublic school, small and large. They were absolutely free from brain.\r\nThey had a certain amount of muscle, and a vast store of animal spirits.\r\nThey looked on school life purely as a vehicle for ragging. The Stones\r\nand Robinsons are the swashbucklers of the school world. They go about,\r\nloud and boisterous, with a wholehearted and cheerful indifference to\r\nother people's feelings, treading on the toes of their neighbor and\r\nshoving him off the pavement, and always with an eye wide open for any\r\nadventure. As to the kind of adventure, they are not particular so long\r\nas it promises excitement. Sometimes they go through their whole school\r\ncareer without accident. More often they run up against a snag in the\r\nshape of some serious-minded and muscular person, who objects to having\r\nhis toes trodden on and being shoved off the pavement, and then they\r\nusually sober down, to the mutual advantage of themselves and the rest\r\nof the community.\r\n\r\nOne's opinion of this type of youth varies according to one's point of\r\nview. Small boys whom they had occasion to kick, either from pure high\r\nspirits or as a punishment for some slip from the narrow path which the\r\nideal small boy should tread, regarded Stone and Robinson as bullies of\r\nthe genuine \"Eric\" and \"St. Winifred's\" brand. Masters were rather\r\nafraid of them. Adair had a smouldering dislike for them. They were\r\nuseful at cricket, but apt not to take Sedleigh as seriously as he could\r\nhave wished.\r\n\r\nAs for Mike, he now found them pleasant company, and began to get out\r\nthe tea things.\r\n\r\n\"Those Fire Brigade meetings,\" said Stone, \"are a rag. You can do what\r\nyou like, and you never get more than a hundred lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you!\" said Mike. \"I got Saturday afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Wilson in too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He got a hundred lines.\"\r\n\r\nStone and Robinson were quite concerned.\r\n\r\n\"What a beastly swindle!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's because you don't play cricket. Old Downing lets you do what you\r\nlike if you join the Fire Brigade and play cricket.\"\r\n\r\n\"'We are, above all, a keen school,'\" quoted Stone. \"Don't you ever\r\nplay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have played a bit,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Well, why don't you have a shot? We aren't such flyers here. If you\r\nknow one end of a bat from the other, you could get into some sort of a\r\nteam. Were you at school anywhere before you came here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was at Wrykyn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why on earth did you leave?\" asked Stone. \"Were you sacked?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. My father took me away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrykyn?\" said Robinson. \"Are you any relation of the Jacksons\r\nthere--J.W. and the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, didn't you play at all there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mike, \"I did. I was in the team three years, and I should\r\nhave been captain this year, if I'd stopped on.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a profound and gratifying sensation. Stone gaped, and Robinson\r\nnearly dropped his teacup.\r\n\r\nStone broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"But I mean to say--look here? What I mean is, why aren't you playing?\r\nWhy don't you play now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. I play for a village near here. Place called Lower Borlock. A man\r\nwho played against Wrykyn for the Free Foresters captains them. He asked\r\nme if I'd like some games for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why not for the school?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I? It's much better fun for the village. You don't get\r\nordered about by Adair, for a start.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adair sticks on side,\" said Stone.\r\n\r\n\"Enough for six,\" agreed Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove,\" said Stone, \"I've got an idea. My word, what a rag!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong now?\" inquired Mike politely.\r\n\r\n\"Why, look here. Tomorrow's Mid-Term Service Day. It's nowhere near the\r\nmiddle of the term, but they always have it in the fourth week. There's\r\nchapel at half past nine till half past ten. Then the rest of the day's\r\na whole holiday. There are always house matches. We're playing\r\nDowning's. Why don't you play and let's smash them?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, yes,\" said Robinson. \"Why don't you? They're always sticking\r\non side because they've won the house cup three years running. I say, do\r\nyou bat or bowl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bat. Why?\"\r\n\r\nRobinson rocked on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Why, old Downing fancies himself as a bowler. You _must_ play, and\r\nknock the cover off him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Masters don't play in house matches, surely?\"\r\n\r\n\"This isn't a real house match. Only a friendly. Downing always turns\r\nout on Mid-Term Service Day. I say, do play.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think of the rag.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the team's full,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"The list isn't up yet. We'll nip across to Barnes's study, and make him\r\nalter it.\"\r\n\r\nThey dashed out of the room. From down the passage Mike heard yells of\r\n\"_Barnes_!\" the closing of a door, and a murmur of excited conversation.\r\nThen footsteps returning down the passage.\r\n\r\nBarnes appeared, on his face the look of one who has seen visions.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" he said, \"is it true? Or is Stone rotting? About Wrykyn, I\r\nmean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was in the team.\"\r\n\r\nBarnes was an enthusiastic cricketer. He studied his _Wisden_, and he\r\nhad an immense respect for Wrykyn cricket.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the M. Jackson, then, who had an average of fifty-one point\r\nnaught three last year?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nBarnes's manner became like that of a curate talking to a bishop.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" he said, \"then--er--will you play against Downing's tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather,\" said Mike. \"Thanks awfully. Have some tea?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nTHE MATCH WITH DOWNING'S\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the curious instinct which prompts most people to rub a thing in\r\nthat makes the lot of the average convert an unhappy one. Only the very\r\nself-controlled can refrain from improving the occasion and scoring off\r\nthe convert. Most leap at the opportunity.\r\n\r\nIt was so in Mike's case. Mike was not a genuine convert, but to Mr.\r\nDowning he had the outward aspect of one. When you have been impressing\r\nupon a noncricketing boy for nearly a month that (_a_) the school is\r\nabove all a keen school, (_b_) that all members of it should play\r\ncricket, and (_c_) that by not playing cricket he is ruining his chances\r\nin this world and imperiling them in the next; and when, quite\r\nunexpectedly, you come upon this boy dressed in cricket flannels,\r\nwearing cricket boots and carrying a cricket bag, it seems only natural\r\nto assume that you have converted him, that the seeds of your eloquence\r\nhave fallen on fruitful soil and sprouted.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing assumed it.\r\n\r\nHe was walking to the field with Adair and another member of his team\r\nwhen he came upon Mike.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he cried. \"Our Jackson clad in suit of mail and armed for the\r\nfray!\"\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Downing's No. 2 manner--the playful.\r\n\r\n\"This is indeed Saul among the prophets. Why this sudden enthusiasm for\r\na game which I understood that you despised? Are our opponents\r\nso reduced?\"\r\n\r\nPsmith, who was with Mike, took charge of the affair with a languid\r\ngrace which had maddened hundreds in its time, and which never failed to\r\nruffle Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"We are, above all, sir,\" he said, \"a keen house. Drones are not\r\nwelcomed by us. We are essentially versatile. Jackson, the archaeologist\r\nof yesterday, becomes the cricketer of today. It is the right spirit,\r\nsir,\" said Psmith earnestly. \"I like to see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Smith? You are not playing yourself, I notice. Your enthusiasm\r\nhas bounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"In our house, sir, competition is fierce, and the Selection Committee\r\nunfortunately passed me over.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were a number of pitches dotted about over the field, for there\r\nwas always a touch of the London Park about it on Mid-Term Service Day.\r\nAdair, as captain of cricket, had naturally selected the best for his\r\nown match. It was a good wicket, Mike saw. As a matter of fact the\r\nwickets at Sedleigh were nearly always good. Adair had infected the\r\ngroundsman with some of his own keenness, with the result that that\r\nonce-leisurely official now found himself sometimes, with a kind of mild\r\nsurprise, working really hard. At the beginning of the previous season\r\nSedleigh had played a scratch team from a neighboring town on a wicket\r\nwhich, except for the creases, was absolutely undistinguishable from the\r\nsurrounding turf, and behind the pavilion after the match Adair had\r\nspoken certain home truths to the groundsman. The latter's reformation\r\nhad dated from that moment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarnes, timidly jubilant, came up to Mike with the news that he had won\r\nthe toss, and the request that Mike would go in first with him.\r\n\r\nIn stories of the \"Not Really a Duffer\" type, where the nervous new boy,\r\nwho has been found crying in the changing room over the photograph of\r\nhis sister, contrives to get an innings in a game, nobody suspects that\r\nhe is really a prodigy till he hits the Bully's first ball out of the\r\nground for six.\r\n\r\nWith Mike it was different. There was no pitying smile on Adair's face\r\nas he started his run preparatory to sending down the first ball. Mike,\r\non the cricket field, could not have looked anything but a cricketer if\r\nhe had turned out in a tweed suit and hobnail boots. Cricketer was\r\nwritten all over him--in his walk, in the way he took guard, in his\r\nstand at the wicket. Adair started to bowl with the feeling that this\r\nwas somebody who had more than a little knowledge of how to deal with\r\ngood bowling and punish bad.\r\n\r\nMike started cautiously. He was more than usually anxious to make runs\r\ntoday, and he meant to take no risks till he could afford to do so. He\r\nhad seen Adair bowl at the nets, and he knew that he was good.\r\n\r\nThe first over was a maiden, six dangerous balls beautifully played. The\r\nfieldsmen changed over.\r\n\r\nThe general interest had now settled on the match between Outwood's and\r\nDowning's. The facts in Mike's case had gone around the field, and, as\r\nseveral of the other games had not yet begun, quite a large crowd had\r\ncollected near the pavilion to watch. Mike's masterly treatment of the\r\nopening over had impressed the spectators, and there was a popular\r\ndesire to see how he would deal with Mr. Downing's slows. It was\r\ngenerally anticipated that he would do something special with them.\r\n\r\nOff the first ball of the master's over a leg-bye was run.\r\n\r\nMike took guard.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was a bowler with a style of his own. He took two short\r\nsteps, two long steps, gave a jump, took three more short steps, and\r\nended with a combination of step and jump, during which the ball emerged\r\nfrom behind his back and started on its slow career to the wicket. The\r\nwhole business had some of the dignity of the old-fashioned minuet,\r\nsubtly blended with the careless vigor of a cakewalk. The ball, when\r\ndelivered, was billed to break from leg, but the program was subject to\r\nalterations.\r\n\r\nIf the spectators had expected Mike to begin any firework effects with\r\nthe first ball, they were disappointed. He played the over through with\r\na grace worthy of his brother Joe. The last ball he turned to leg for\r\na single.\r\n\r\nHis treatment of Adair's next over was freer. He had got a sight of the\r\nball now. Halfway through the over a beautiful square cut forced a\r\npassage through the crowd by the pavilion, and dashed up against the\r\nrails. He drove the sixth ball past cover for three.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was now reluctantly dispersing to its own games, but it\r\nstopped as Mr. Downing started his minuet-cakewalk, in the hope that it\r\nmight see something more sensational.\r\n\r\nThis time the hope was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe ball was well up, slow, and off the wicket on the on-side. Perhaps\r\nif it had been allowed to pitch, it might have broken in and become\r\nquite dangerous. Mike went out at it, and hit it a couple of feet from\r\nthe ground. The ball dropped with a thud and a spurting of dust in the\r\nroad that ran along one side of the cricket field.\r\n\r\nIt was returned on the installment system by helpers from other games,\r\nand the bowler began his maneuvers again. A half volley this time. Mike\r\nslammed it back, and mid on, whose heart was obviously not in the thing,\r\nfailed to stop it.\r\n\r\n\"Get to them, Jenkins,\" said Mr. Downing irritably, as the ball came\r\nback from the boundary. \"Get to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, please, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk in the field, Jenkins.\"\r\n\r\nHaving had a full pitch hit for six and a half volley for four, there\r\nwas a strong probability that Mr. Downing would pitch his next\r\nball short.\r\n\r\nThe expected happened. The third ball was a slow long hop, and hit the\r\nroad at about the same spot where the first had landed. A howl of\r\nuntuneful applause rose from the watchers in the pavilion, and Mike,\r\nwith the feeling that this sort of bowling was too good to be true,\r\nwaited in position for number four.\r\n\r\nThere are moments when a sort of panic seizes a bowler. This happened\r\nnow with Mr. Downing. He suddenly abandoned science and ran amok. His\r\nrun lost its stateliness and increased its vigor. He charged up to the\r\nwicket as a wounded buffalo sometimes charges a gun. His whole idea now\r\nwas to bowl fast.\r\n\r\nWhen a slow bowler starts to bowl fast, it is usually as well to be\r\nbatting, if you can manage it.\r\n\r\nBy the time the over was finished, Mike's score had been increased by\r\nsixteen, and the total of his side, in addition, by three wides.\r\n\r\nAnd a shrill small voice, from the neighborhood of the pavilion, uttered\r\nwith painful distinctness the words, \"Take him off!\"\r\n\r\nThat was how the most sensational day's cricket began that Sedleigh had\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nA description of the details of the morning's play would be monotonous.\r\nIt is enough to say that they ran on much the same lines as the third\r\nand fourth overs of the match. Mr. Downing bowled one more over, off\r\nwhich Mike helped himself to sixteen runs, and then retired moodily to\r\ncover point, where, in Adair's fifth over, he missed Barnes--the first\r\noccasion since the game began on which that mild batsman had attempted\r\nto score more than a single. Scared by this escape, Outwood's captain\r\nshrank back into his shell, sat on the splice like a limpet, and,\r\noffering no more chances, was not out at lunchtime with a score of\r\neleven. Mike had then made a hundred and three.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Mike was taking off his pads in the pavilion, Adair came up.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you say you didn't play cricket?\" he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\nWhen one has been bowling the whole morning, and bowling well, without\r\nthe slightest success, one is inclined to be abrupt.\r\n\r\nMike finished unfastening an obstinate strap. Then he looked up.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say anything of the kind. I said I wasn't going to play here.\r\nThere's a difference. As a matter of fact, I was in the Wrykyn team\r\nbefore I came here. Three years.\"\r\n\r\nAdair was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Will you play for us against the Old Sedleighans tomorrow?\" he said at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nMike tossed his pads into his bag and got up.\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\n\"Above it, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit. Not up to it. I shall want a lot of coaching at that end net\r\nof yours before I'm fit to play for Sedleigh.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another pause.\r\n\r\n\"Then you won't play?\" asked Adair.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not keeping you, am I?\" said Mike, politely.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable what a number of members of Outwood's house appeared\r\nto cherish a personal grudge against Mr. Downing. It had been that\r\nmaster's somewhat injudicious practice for many years to treat his own\r\nhouse as a sort of Chosen People. Of all masters, the most unpopular is\r\nhe who by the silent tribunal of a school is convicted of favoritism.\r\nAnd the dislike deepens if it is a house which he favors and not merely\r\nindividuals. On occasions when boys in his own house and boys from other\r\nhouses were accomplices and partners in wrongdoing, Mr. Downing\r\ndistributed his thunderbolts unequally, and the school noticed it. The\r\nresult was that not only he himself, but also--which was rather\r\nunfair--his house, too, had acquired a good deal of unpopularity.\r\n\r\nThe general consensus of opinion in Outwood's during the luncheon\r\ninterval was that having got Downing's up a tree, they would be fools\r\nnot to make the most of the situation.\r\n\r\nBarnes's remark that he supposed, unless anything happened and wickets\r\nbegan to fall a bit faster, they had better think of declaring somewhere\r\nabout half past three or four, was met with a storm of opposition.\r\n\r\n\"Declare!\" said Robinson. \"Great Scot, what on earth are you talking\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Declare!\" Stone's voice was almost a wail of indignation. \"I never saw\r\nsuch a chump.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll be rather sick if we don't, won't they?\" suggested Barnes.\r\n\r\n\"Sick! I should think they would,\" said Stone. \"That's just the gay\r\nidea. Can't you see that by a miracle we've got a chance of getting a\r\njolly good bit of our own back against those Downing's ticks? What we've\r\ngot to do is to jolly well keep them in the field all day if we can, and\r\nbe jolly glad it's so beastly hot. If they lose about a dozen pounds\r\neach through sweating about in the sun after Jackson's drives, perhaps\r\nthey'll stick on less side about things in general in future. Besides, I\r\nwant an innings against that bilge of old Downing's, if I can get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"If you declare, I swear I won't field. Nor will Robinson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I won't then,\" said Barnes unhappily. \"Only you know they're\r\nrather sick already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry about that,\" said Stone with a wide grin. \"They'll be a\r\nlot sicker before we've finished.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that that particular Mid-Term Service-Day match\r\nmade history. Big scores had often been put up on Mid-Term Service Day.\r\nGames had frequently been one-sided. But it had never happened before in\r\nthe annals of the school that one side, going in first early in the\r\nmorning, had neither completed its innings nor declared it closed when\r\nstumps were drawn at 6.30. In no previous Sedleigh match, after a full\r\nday's play, had the pathetic words \"Did not bat\" been written against\r\nthe whole of one of the contending teams.\r\n\r\nThese are the things which mark epochs.\r\n\r\nPlay was resumed at 2.15. For a quarter of an hour Mike was\r\ncomparatively quiet. Adair, fortified by food and rest, was bowling\r\nreally well, and his first half dozen overs had to be watched carefully.\r\nBut the wicket was too good to give him a chance, and Mike, playing\r\nhimself in again, proceeded to get to business once more. Bowlers came\r\nand went. Adair pounded away at one end with brief intervals between the\r\nattacks. Mr. Downing took a couple more overs, in one of which a horse,\r\npassing in the road, nearly had its useful life cut suddenly short.\r\nChange bowlers of various actions and paces, each weirder and more\r\nfutile than the last, tried their luck. But still the first-wicket stand\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThe bowling of a house team is all head and no body. The first pair\r\nprobably have some idea of length and break. The first-change pair are\r\npoor. And the rest, the small change, are simply the sort of things one\r\nsees in dreams after a heavy supper, or when one is out without\r\none's gun.\r\n\r\nTime, mercifully, generally breaks up a big stand at cricket before the\r\nfield has suffered too much, and that is what happened now. At four\r\no'clock, when the score stood at two hundred and twenty for no wicket,\r\nBarnes, greatly daring, smote lustily at a rather wide half volley and\r\nwas caught at short slip for thirty-three. He retired blushfully to the\r\npavilion, amidst applause, and Stone came out.\r\n\r\nAs Mike had then made a hundred and eighty-seven, it was assumed by the\r\nfield, that directly he had topped his second century, the closure would\r\nbe applied and their ordeal finished. There was almost a sigh of relief\r\nwhen frantic cheering from the crowd told that the feat had been\r\naccomplished. The fieldsmen clapped in quite an indulgent sort of way,\r\nas who should say, \"Capital, capital. And now let's start _our_\r\ninnings.\" Some even began to edge toward the pavilion.\r\n\r\nBut the next ball was bowled, and the next over, and the next after\r\nthat, and still Barnes made no sign. (The conscience stricken captain of\r\nOutwood's was, as a matter of fact, being practically held down by\r\nRobinson and other ruffians by force.)\r\n\r\nA gray dismay settled on the field.\r\n\r\nThe bowling had now become almost unbelievably bad. Lobs were being\r\ntried, and Stone, nearly weeping with pure joy, was playing an innings\r\nof the \"How-to-brighten-cricket\" type. He had an unorthodox style, but\r\nan excellent eye, and the road at this period of the game became\r\nabsolutely unsafe for pedestrians and traffic.\r\n\r\nMike's pace had become slower, as was only natural, but his score, too,\r\nwas mounting steadily.\r\n\r\n\"This is foolery,\" snapped Mr. Downing, as the three hundred and fifty\r\nwent up on the board. \"Barnes!\" he called.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. A committee of three was at that moment engaged in\r\nsitting on Barnes's head in the first eleven changing room, in order to\r\ncorrect a more than usually feverish attack of conscience.\r\n\r\n\"Barnes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" said Stone, some species of telepathy telling him what\r\nwas detaining his captain. \"I think Barnes must have left the field. He\r\nhas probably gone over to the house to fetch something.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is absurd. You must declare your innings closed. The game has\r\nbecome a farce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Declare! Sir, we can't unless Barnes does. He might be awfully annoyed\r\nif we did anything like that without consulting him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's very touchy, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is perfect foolery.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Jenkins is just going to bowl, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing walked moodily to his place.\r\n\r\nIn a neat wooden frame in the senior day room at Outwood's, just above\r\nthe mantlepiece, there was on view, a week later, a slip of paper.\r\n\r\nThe writing on it was as follows:\r\n\r\n  OUTWOOD'S _v_. DOWNING'S\r\n\r\n  _Outwood's. First innings_.\r\n\r\n  J.P. Barnes, _c_. Hammond, _b_. Hassall      33\r\n  M. Jackson, not out                         277\r\n  W.J. Stone, not out                         124\r\n    Extras                                     37\r\n        Total (for one wicket)                471\r\n\r\n  Downing's did not bat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nTHE SINGULAR BEHAVIOR OF JELLICOE\r\n\r\n\r\nOutwood's rollicked considerably that night. Mike, if he had cared to\r\ntake the part, could have been the Petted Hero. But a cordial invitation\r\nfrom the senior day room to be the guest of the evening at about the\r\nbiggest rag of the century had been refused on the plea of fatigue. One\r\ndoes not make two hundred and seventy-seven runs on a hot day without\r\nfeeling the effects, even if one has scored mainly by the medium of\r\nboundaries; and Mike, as he lay back in Psmith's deck chair, felt that\r\nall he wanted was to go to bed and stay there for a week. His hands and\r\narms burned as if they were red-hot, and his eyes were so tired that he\r\ncould not keep them open.\r\n\r\nPsmith, leaning against the mantlepiece, discoursed in a desultory way\r\non the day's happenings--the score off Mr. Downing, the undeniable\r\nannoyance of that battered bowler, and the probability of his venting\r\nhis annoyance on Mike next day.\r\n\r\n\"In theory,\" said he, \"the manly what-d'you-call-it of cricket and all\r\nthat sort of thing ought to make him fall on your neck tomorrow and weep\r\nover you as a foeman worthy of his steel. But I am prepared to bet a\r\nreasonable sum that he will give no jujitsu exhibition of this kind. In\r\nfact, from what I have seen of our bright little friend, I should say\r\nthat, in a small way, he will do his best to make it distinctly hot for\r\nyou, here and there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" murmured Mike, shifting his aching limbs in the chair.\r\n\r\n\"In an ordinary way, I suppose, a man can put up with having his bowling\r\nhit a little. But your performance was cruelty to animals. Twenty-eight\r\noff one over, not to mention three wides, would have made Job foam at\r\nthe mouth. You will probably get sacked. On the other hand, it's worth\r\nit. You have lit a candle this day which can never be blown out. You\r\nhave shown the lads of the village how Comrade Downing's bowling ought\r\nto be treated. I don't suppose he'll ever take another wicket.\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't deserve to.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith smoothed his hair at the glass and turned round again.\r\n\r\n\"The only blot on this day of mirth and goodwill is,\" he said, \"the\r\nsingular conduct of our friend Jellicoe. When all the place was ringing\r\nwith song and merriment, Comrade Jellicoe crept to my side, and,\r\nslipping his little hand in mine, touched me for three quid.\"\r\n\r\nThis interested Mike, tired as he was.\r\n\r\n\"What! Three quid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Three crisp, crackling quid. He wanted four.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the man must be living at the rate of I don't know what. It was\r\nonly yesterday that he borrowed a quid from _me_!\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be saving money fast. There appear to be the makings of a\r\nfinancier about Comrade Jellicoe. Well, I hope, when he's collected\r\nenough for his needs, he'll pay me back a bit. I'm pretty well\r\ncleaned out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I got some from my brother at Oxford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he's saving up to get married. We may be helping toward\r\nfurnishing the home. There was a Siamese prince fellow at my dame's at\r\nEton who had four wives when he arrived, and gathered in a fifth during\r\nhis first summer holidays. It was done on the correspondence system. His\r\nPrime Minister fixed it up at the other end, and sent him the glad news\r\non a picture post card. I think an eye ought to be kept on Comrade\r\nJellicoe.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMike tumbled into bed that night like a log, but he could not sleep. He\r\nached all over. Psmith chatted for a time on human affairs in general,\r\nand then dropped gently off. Jellicoe, who appeared to be wrapped in\r\ngloom, contributed nothing to the conversation.\r\n\r\nAfter Psmith had gone to sleep, Mike lay for some time running over in\r\nhis mind, as the best substitute for sleep, the various points of his\r\ninnings that day. He felt very hot and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nJust as he was wondering whether it would not be a good idea to get up\r\nand have a cold bath, a voice spoke from the darkness at his side.\r\n\r\n\"Are you asleep, Jackson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me--Jellicoe. I can't get to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor can I. I'm stiff all over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come over and sit on your bed.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a creaking, and then a weight descended in the neighborhood of\r\nMike's toes.\r\n\r\nJellicoe was apparently not in conversational mood. He uttered no word\r\nfor quite three minutes. At the end of which time he gave a sound midway\r\nbetween a snort and a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Jackson!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you--oh, nothing.\"\r\n\r\nSilence again.\r\n\r\n\"Jackson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, what would your people say if you got sacked?\"\r\n\r\n\"All sorts of things. Especially my father. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. So would mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody's would, I expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe bed creaked, as Jellicoe digested these great thoughts. Then he\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a jolly beastly thing to get sacked.\"\r\n\r\nMike was too tired to give his mind to the subject. He was not really\r\nlistening. Jellicoe droned on in a depressed sort of way.\r\n\r\n\"You'd get home in the middle of the afternoon, I suppose, and you'd\r\ndrive up to the house, and the servant would open the door, and you'd go\r\nin. They might all be out, and then you'd have to hang about, and wait;\r\nand presently you'd hear them come in, and you'd go out into the\r\npassage, and they'd say 'Hello!'\"\r\n\r\nJellicoe, in order to give verisimilitude, as it were, to an otherwise\r\nbald and unconvincing narrative, flung so much agitated surprise into\r\nthe last word that it woke Mike from a troubled doze into which he\r\nhad fallen.\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\" he said. \"What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'd say, 'Hello!' And then they'd say, 'What are you doing\r\nhere?' And you'd say--\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth are you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"About what would happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happen when?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you got home. After being sacked, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's been sacked?\" Mike's mind was still under a cloud.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody. But if you were, I meant. And then I suppose there'd be an\r\nawful row and general sickness, and all that. And then you'd be sent\r\ninto a bank, or to Australia, or something.\"\r\n\r\nMike dozed off again.\r\n\r\n\"My father would be frightfully sick. My mater would be sick. My sister\r\nwould be jolly sick, too. Have you got any sisters, Jackson? I\r\nsay, Jackson!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello! What's the matter? Who's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me--Jellicoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked you if you'd got any sisters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any _what?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Sisters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose sisters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours. I asked if you'd got any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sisters.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about them?\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation was becoming too intricate for Jellicoe. He changed the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Jackson!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, you don't know anyone who could lend me a pound, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Mike, sitting up in bed and staring through the darkness\r\nin the direction whence the numismatist's voice was proceeding.\r\n\"Do _what?_\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, look out. You'll wake Psmith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you say you wanted someone to lend you a quid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jellicoe eagerly. \"Do you know anyone?\"\r\n\r\nMike's head throbbed. This thing was too much. The human brain could not\r\nbe expected to cope with it. Here was a youth who had borrowed a pound\r\nfrom one friend the day before, and three pounds from another friend\r\nthat very afternoon, already looking about him for further loans. Was it\r\na hobby, or was he saving up to buy an airplane?\r\n\r\n\"What on earth do you want a pound for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to tell anybody. But it's jolly serious. I shall get\r\nsacked if I don't get it.\"\r\n\r\nMike pondered.\r\n\r\nThose who have followed Mike's career as set forth by the present\r\nhistorian will have realized by this time that he was a good long way\r\nfrom being perfect. As the Blue-Eyed Hero he would have been a rank\r\nfailure. Except on the cricket field, where he was a natural genius, he\r\nwas just ordinary. He resembled ninety percent of other members of\r\nEnglish public schools. He had some virtues and a good many defects. He\r\nwas as obstinate as a mule, though people whom he liked could do as they\r\npleased with him. He was good-natured as a general thing, but on\r\noccasion his temper could be of the worst, and had, in his childhood,\r\nbeen the subject of much adverse comment among his aunts. He was rigidly\r\ntruthful, where the issue concerned only himself. Where it was a case of\r\nsaving a friend, he was prepared to act in a manner reminiscent of an\r\nAmerican expert witness.\r\n\r\nHe had, in addition, one good quality without any defect to balance it.\r\nHe was always ready to help people. And when he set himself to do this,\r\nhe was never put off by discomfort or risk. He went at the thing with a\r\nsingleness of purpose that asked no questions.\r\n\r\nBob's postal order which had arrived that evening, was reposing in the\r\nbreast pocket of his coat.\r\n\r\nIt was a wrench, but, if the situation was so serious with Jellicoe, it\r\nhad to be done.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later the night was being made hideous by Jellicoe's almost\r\ntearful protestations of gratitude, and the postal order had moved from\r\none side of the dormitory to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nJELLICOE GOES ON THE SICK LIST\r\n\r\n\r\nMike woke next morning with a confused memory of having listened to a\r\ngreat deal of incoherent conversation from Jellicoe, and a painfully\r\nvivid recollection of handing over the bulk of his worldly wealth to\r\nhim. The thought depressed him, though it seemed to please Jellicoe, for\r\nthe latter caroled in a gay undertone as he dressed, till Psmith, who\r\nhad a sensitive ear, asked as a favor that these farmyard imitations\r\nmight cease until he was out of the room.\r\n\r\nThere were other things to make Mike low-spirited that morning. To begin\r\nwith, he was in detention, which in itself is enough to spoil a day. It\r\nwas a particularly fine day, which made the matter worse. In addition to\r\nthis, he had never felt stiffer in his life. It seemed to him that the\r\ncreaking of his joints as he walked must be audible to everyone within a\r\nradius of several yards. Finally, there was the interview with Mr.\r\nDowning to come. That would probably be unpleasant. As Psmith had said,\r\nMr. Downing was the sort of master who would be likely to make trouble.\r\nThe great match had not been an ordinary match. Mr. Downing was a\r\ncurious man in many ways, but he did not make a fuss on ordinary\r\noccasions when his bowling proved expensive. Yesterday's performance,\r\nhowever, stood in a class by itself. It stood forth without disguise as\r\na deliberate rag. One side does not keep another in the field the whole\r\nday in a one-day match except as a grisly kind of practical joke. And\r\nMr. Downing and his house realized this. The house's way of signifying\r\nits comprehension of the fact was to be cold and distant as far as the\r\nseniors were concerned, and abusive and pugnacious as regards the\r\njuniors. Young blood had been shed overnight, and more flowed during the\r\neleven-o'-clock interval that morning to avenge the insult.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing's methods of retaliation would have to be, of necessity,\r\nmore elusive; but Mike did not doubt that in some way or other his form\r\nmaster would endeavor to get a bit of his own back.\r\n\r\nAs events turned out, he was perfectly right. When a master has got his\r\nknife into a boy, especially a master who allows himself to be\r\ninfluenced by his likes and dislikes, he is inclined to single him out\r\nin times of stress, and savage him as if he were the official\r\nrepresentative of the evildoers. Just as, at sea, the skipper when he\r\nhas trouble with the crew, works it off on the boy.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was in a sarcastic mood when he met Mike. That is to say, he\r\nbegan in a sarcastic strain. But this sort of thing is difficult to keep\r\nup. By the time he had reached his peroration, the rapier had given\r\nplace to the bludgeon. For sarcasm to be effective, the user of it must\r\nbe met halfway. His hearer must appear to be conscious of the sarcasm\r\nand moved by it. Mike, when masters waxed sarcastic toward him, always\r\nassumed an air of stolid stupidity, which was as a suit of mail\r\nagainst satire.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Downing came down from the heights with a run, and began to\r\nexpress himself with a simple strength which it did his form good to\r\nlisten to. Veterans who had been in the form for terms said afterward\r\nthat there had been nothing to touch it, in their experience of the\r\norator, since the glorious day when Dunster, that prince of raggers, who\r\nhad left at Christmas to go to a crammer's, had introduced three lively\r\ngrass snakes into the room during a Latin lesson.\r\n\r\n\"You are surrounded,\" concluded Mr. Downing, snapping his pencil in two\r\nin his emotion, \"by an impenetrable mass of conceit and vanity and\r\nselfishness. It does not occur to you to admit your capabilities as a\r\ncricketer in an open, straightforward way and place them at the disposal\r\nof the school. No, that would not be dramatic enough for you. It would\r\nbe too commonplace altogether. Far too commonplace!\" Mr. Downing laughed\r\nbitterly. \"No, you must conceal your capabilities. You must act a lie.\r\nYou must--who is that shuffling his feet? I will not have it, I _will_\r\nhave silence--you must hang back in order to make a more effective\r\nentrance, like some wretched actor who--I will _not_ have this\r\nshuffling. I have spoken of this before. Macpherson, are you shuffling\r\nyour feet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, no, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Parsons?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's the noise of the draft under the door, sir.\"\r\n\r\nInstant departure of Parsons for the outer regions. And, in the\r\nexcitement of this side issue, the speaker lost his inspiration, and\r\nabruptly concluded his remarks by putting Mike on to translate in\r\nCicero. Which Mike, who happened to have prepared the first half-page,\r\ndid with much success.\r\n\r\nThe Old Boys' match was timed to begin shortly after eleven o'clock.\r\nDuring the interval most of the school walked across the field to look\r\nat the pitch. One or two of the Old Boys had already changed and were\r\npracticing in front of the pavilion.\r\n\r\nIt was through one of these batsmen that an accident occurred which had\r\na good deal of influence on Mike's affairs.\r\n\r\nMike had strolled out by himself. Halfway across the field Jellicoe\r\njoined him. Jellicoe was cheerful, and rather embarrassingly grateful.\r\nHe was just in the middle of his harangue when the accident happened.\r\n\r\nTo their left, as they crossed the field, a long youth, with the faint\r\nbeginnings of a moustache and a blazer that lit up the surrounding\r\nlandscape like a glowing beacon, was lashing out recklessly at a\r\nfriend's bowling. Already he had gone within an ace of slaying a small\r\nboy. As Mike and Jellicoe proceeded on their way, there was a shout\r\nof \"Heads!\"\r\n\r\nThe almost universal habit of batsmen of shouting \"Heads!\" at whatever\r\nheight from the ground the ball may be, is not a little confusing. The\r\naverage person, on hearing the shout, puts his hands over his skull,\r\ncrouches down and trusts to luck. This is an excellent plan if the ball\r\nis falling, but is not much protection against a skimming drive along\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nWhen \"Heads!\" was called on the present occasion, Mike and Jellicoe\r\ninstantly assumed the crouching attitude.\r\n\r\nJellicoe was the first to abandon it. He uttered a yell and sprang into\r\nthe air. After which he sat down and began to nurse his ankle.\r\n\r\nThe bright-blazered youth walked up.\r\n\r\n\"Awfully sorry, you know. Hurt?\"\r\n\r\nJellicoe was pressing the injured spot tenderly with his fingertips,\r\nuttering sharp howls whenever, zeal outrunning discretion, he prodded\r\nhimself too energetically.\r\n\r\n\"Silly ass, Dunster,\" he groaned, \"slamming about like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awfully sorry. But I did yell.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's swelling up rather,\" said Mike. \"You'd better get over to the\r\nhouse and have it looked at. Can you walk?\"\r\n\r\nJellicoe tried, but sat down again with a loud \"Ow!\" At that moment the\r\nbell rang.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to be going in,\" said Mike, \"or I'd have helped you over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you a hand,\" said Dunster.\r\n\r\nHe helped the sufferer to his feet and they staggered off together,\r\nJellicoe hopping, Dunster advancing with a sort of polka step. Mike\r\nwatched them start and then turned to go in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nMIKE RECEIVES A COMMISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is only one thing to be said in favor of detention on a fine\r\nsummer's afternoon, and that is that it is very pleasant to come out of.\r\nThe sun never seems so bright or the turf so green as during the first\r\nfive minutes after one has come out of the detention room. One feels as\r\nif one were entering a new and very delightful world. There is also a\r\ntouch of the Rip van Winkle feeling. Everything seems to have gone on\r\nand left one behind. Mike, as he walked to the cricket field, felt very\r\nmuch behind the times.\r\n\r\nArriving on the field he found the Old Boys batting. He stopped and\r\nwatched an over of Adair's. The fifth ball bowled a man. Mike made his\r\nway toward the pavilion.\r\n\r\nBefore he got there he heard his name called, and turning, found Psmith\r\nseated under a tree with the bright-blazered Dunster.\r\n\r\n\"Return of the exile,\" said Psmith. \"A joyful occasion tinged with\r\nmelancholy. Have a cherry?--take one or two. These little acts of\r\nunremembered kindness are what one needs after a couple of hours in\r\nextra pupil room. Restore your tissues, Comrade Jackson, and when you\r\nhave finished those, apply again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your name Jackson?\" inquired Dunster, \"because Jellicoe wants to see\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, poor Jellicoe!\" said Psmith. \"He is now prone on his bed in the\r\ndormitory--there a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Jellicoe, the darling of the\r\ncrew, faithful below he did his duty, but Comrade Dunster has broached\r\nhim to. I have just been hearing the melancholy details.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Smith and I,\" said Dunster, \"were at prep school together. I'd no\r\nidea I should find him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a wonderfully stirring sight when we met,\" said Psmith; \"not\r\nunlike the meeting of Ulysses and the hound Argos, of whom you have\r\ndoubtless read in the course of your dabblings in the classics. I was\r\nUlysses; Dunster gave a lifelike representation of the faithful dawg.\"\r\n\r\n\"You still jaw as much as ever, I notice,\" said the animal delineator,\r\nfondling the beginnings of his moustache.\r\n\r\n\"More,\" sighed Psmith, \"more. Is anything irritating you?\" he added,\r\neyeing the other's maneuvers with interest.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be a funny ass, man,\" said Dunster, pained; \"heaps of\r\npeople tell me I ought to have it waxed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What it really wants is top-dressing with guano. Hello! another man\r\nout. Adair's bowling better today than he did yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard about yesterday,\" said Dunster. \"It must have been a rag!\r\nCouldn't we work off some other rag on somebody before I go? I shall be\r\nstopping here till Monday in the village. Well hit, sir--Adair's bowling\r\nis perfectly simple if you go out to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comrade Dunster went out to it first ball,\" said Psmith to Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! chuck it, man; the sun was in my eyes. I hear Adair's got a match\r\non with the M.C.C. at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he?\" said Psmith; \"I hadn't heard. Archaeology claims so much of my\r\ntime that I have little leisure for listening to cricket chitchat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it Jellicoe wanted?\" asked Mike; \"was it anything important?\"\r\n\r\n\"He seemed to think so--he kept telling me to tell you to go and see\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear Comrade Jellicoe is a bit of a weak-minded blitherer--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of a rag we worked off on Jellicoe once?\" asked\r\nDunster. \"The man has absolutely no sense of humor--can't see when he's\r\nbeing rotted. Well, it was like this--hello! We're all out--I shall have\r\nto be going out to field again, I suppose, dash it! I'll tell you when I\r\nsee you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall count the minutes,\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\nMike stretched himself; the sun was very soothing after his two hours in\r\nthe detention room; he felt disinclined for exertion.\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose it's anything special about Jellicoe, do you?\" he said.\r\n\"I mean, it'll keep till teatime; it's no catch having to sweat across\r\nto the house now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't dream of moving,\" said Psmith. \"I have several rather profound\r\nobservations on life to make and I can't make them without an audience.\r\nSoliloquy is a knack. Hamlet had got it, but probably only after years\r\nof patient practice. Personally, I need someone to listen when I talk. I\r\nlike to feel that I am doing good. You stay where you are--don't\r\ninterrupt too much.\"\r\n\r\nMike tilted his hat over his eyes and abandoned Jellicoe.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the lock-up bell rang that he remembered him. He went\r\nover to the house and made his way to the dormitory, where he found the\r\ninjured one in a parlous state, not so much physical as mental. The\r\ndoctor had seen his ankle and reported that it would be on the active\r\nlist in a couple of days. It was Jellicoe's mind that needed\r\nattention now.\r\n\r\nMike found him in a condition bordering on collapse. \"I say, you might\r\nhave come before!\" said Jellicoe.\r\n\r\n\"What's up? I didn't know there was such a hurry about it--what did you\r\nwant?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no good now,\" said Jellicoe gloomily; \"it's too late, I shall get\r\nsacked.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth are you talking about? What's the row?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's about that money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had to pay it to a man today, or he said he'd write to the Head--then\r\nof course I should get sacked. I was going to take the money to him this\r\nafternoon, only I got crocked, so I couldn't move. I wanted to get hold\r\nof you to ask you to take it for me--it's too late now!\"\r\n\r\nMike's face fell. \"Oh, hang it!\" he said, \"I'm awfully sorry. I'd no\r\nidea it was anything like that--what a fool I was! Dunster did say he\r\nthought it was something important, only like an ass I thought it would\r\ndo if I came over at lockup.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Jellicoe miserably; \"it can't be helped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it can,\" said Mike. \"I know what I'll do--it's all right. I'll get\r\nout of the house after lights-out.\"\r\n\r\nJellicoe sat up. \"You can't! You'd get sacked if you were caught.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who would catch me? There was a chap at Wrykyn I knew who used to break\r\nout every night nearly and go and pot at cats with an air pistol; it's\r\nas easy as anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe toad-under-the-harrow expression began to fade from Jellicoe's face.\r\n\"I say, do you think you could, really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I can! It'll be rather a rag.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, it's frightfully decent of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What absolute rot!\"\r\n\r\n\"But look here, are you certain--\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be all right. Where do you want me to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a place about a mile or two from here, called Lower Borlock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lower Borlock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather! I've been playing cricket for them all the term.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, have you? Do you know a man called Barley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Barley? Rather--he runs the White Boar.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's the chap I owe the money to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Barley!\"\r\n\r\nMike knew the landlord of the White Boar well; he was the wag of the\r\nvillage team. Every village team, for some mysterious reason, has its\r\ncomic man. In the Lower Borlock eleven Mr. Barley filled the post. He\r\nwas a large, stout man, with a red and cheerful face, who looked exactly\r\nlike the jovial innkeeper of melodrama. He was the last man Mike would\r\nhave expected to do the \"money by Monday-week or I write to the\r\nheadmaster\" business.\r\n\r\nBut he reflected that he had only seen him in his leisure moments, when\r\nhe might naturally be expected to unbend and be full of the milk of\r\nhuman kindness. Probably in business hours he was quite different. After\r\nall, pleasure is one thing and business another.\r\n\r\nBesides, five pounds is a large sum of money, and if Jellicoe owed it,\r\nthere was nothing strange in Mr. Barley's doing everything he could to\r\nrecover it.\r\n\r\nHe wondered a little what Jellicoe could have been doing to run up a\r\nbill as big as that, but it did not occur to him to ask, which was\r\nunfortunate, as it might have saved him a good deal of inconvenience. It\r\nseemed to him that it was none of his business to inquire into\r\nJellicoe's private affairs. He took the envelope containing the money\r\nwithout question.\r\n\r\n\"I shall bike there, I think,\" he said, \"if I can get into the shed.\"\r\n\r\nThe school's bicycles were stored in a shed by the pavilion.\r\n\r\n\"You can manage that,\" said Jellicoe; \"it's locked up at night, but I\r\nhad a key made to fit it last summer, because I used to get out in the\r\nearly morning sometimes before it was opened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got it on you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Smith's got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get it from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell Smith why you want it, will you? I don't want anybody to\r\nknow--if a thing once starts getting about it's all over the place in\r\nno time.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I won't tell him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, thanks most awfully! I don't know what I should have done, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, chuck it!\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n... AND FULFILLS IT\r\n\r\n\r\nMike started on his ride to Lower Borlock with mixed feelings. It is\r\npleasant to be out on a fine night in summer, but the pleasure is to a\r\ncertain extent modified when one feels that to be detected will mean\r\nexpulsion.\r\n\r\nMike did not want to be expelled, for many reasons. Now that he had\r\ngrown used to the place he was enjoying himself at Sedleigh to a certain\r\nextent. He still harbored a feeling of resentment against the school in\r\ngeneral and Adair in particular, but it was pleasant in Outwood's now\r\nthat he had got to know some of the members of the house, and he liked\r\nplaying cricket for Lower Borlock; also, he was fairly certain that his\r\nfather would not let him go to Cambridge if he were expelled from\r\nSedleigh. Mr. Jackson was easygoing with his family, but occasionally\r\nhis foot came down like a steam hammer, as witness the Wrykyn\r\nschool-report affair.\r\n\r\nSo Mike pedaled along rapidly, being wishful to get the job done without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nPsmith had yielded up the key, but his inquiries as to why it was needed\r\nhad been embarrassing. Mike's statement that he wanted to get up early\r\nand have a ride had been received by Psmith, with whom early rising was\r\nnot a hobby, with honest amazement and a flood of advice and warning on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\"One of the Georges,\" said Psmith, \"I forget which, once said that a\r\ncertain number of hours' sleep a day--I cannot recall for the moment how\r\nmany--made a man something, which for the time being has slipped my\r\nmemory. However, there you are. I've given you the main idea of the\r\nthing; and a German doctor says that early rising causes insanity.\r\nStill, if you're bent on it....\" After which he had handed over the key.\r\n\r\nMike wished he could have taken Psmith into his confidence. Probably he\r\nwould have volunteered to come, too; Mike would have been glad of a\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nIt did not take him long to reach Lower Borlock. The White Boar stood at\r\nthe far end of the village, by the cricket field. He rode past the\r\nchurch--standing out black and mysterious against the light sky--and the\r\nrows of silent cottages, until he came to the inn.\r\n\r\nThe place was shut, of course, and all the lights were out--it was\r\nsometime past eleven.\r\n\r\nThe advantage an inn has over a private house, from the point of view of\r\nthe person who wants to get into it when it has been locked up, is that\r\na nocturnal visit is not so unexpected in the case of the former.\r\nPreparations have been made to meet such an emergency. Where with a\r\nprivate house you would probably have to wander around heaving rocks and\r\nend by climbing up a waterspout, when you want to get into an inn you\r\nsimply ring the night bell, which, communicating with the boots' room,\r\nhas that hard-worked menial up and doing in no time.\r\n\r\nAfter Mike had waited for a few minutes there was a rattling of chains\r\nand a shooting of bolts and the door opened.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" said the boots, appearing in his shirt sleeves. \"Why, 'ello!\r\nMr. Jackson, sir!\"\r\n\r\nMike was well known to all dwellers in Lower Borlock, his scores being\r\nthe chief topic of conversation when the day's labors were over.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see Mr. Barley, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's bin' in bed this half hour back, Mr. Jackson.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must see him. Can you get him down?\"\r\n\r\nThe boots looked doubtful. \"Roust the guv'nor outer bed?\" he said.\r\n\r\nMike quite admitted the gravity of the task. The landlord of the White\r\nBoar was one of those men who need a beauty sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would--it's a thing that can't wait. I've got some money to\r\ngive to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if it's _that_ ...\" said the boots.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later mine host appeared in person, looking more than\r\nusually portly in a check dressing gown and red bedroom slippers.\r\n\r\n\"You can pop off, Jack.\"\r\n\r\nExit boots to his slumbers once more.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Jackson, what's it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jellicoe asked me to come and bring you the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"The money? What money?\"\r\n\r\n\"What he owes you; the five pounds, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"The five--\" Mr. Barley stared openmouthed at Mike for a moment; then he\r\nbroke into a roar of laughter which shook the sporting prints on the\r\nwall and drew barks from dogs in some distant part of the house. He\r\nstaggered about laughing and coughing till Mike began to expect a fit of\r\nsome kind. Then he collapsed into a chair, which creaked under him, and\r\nwiped his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear!\" he said, \"Oh dear! The five pounds!\"\r\n\r\nMike was not always abreast of the rustic idea of humor, and now he felt\r\nparticularly fogged. For the life of him he could not see what there was\r\nto amuse anyone so much in the fact that a person who owed five pounds\r\nwas ready to pay it back. It was an occasion for rejoicing, perhaps, but\r\nrather for a solemn, thankful, eyes-raised-to-heaven kind of rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Five pounds!\"\r\n\r\n\"You might tell us the joke.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barley opened the letter, read it, and had another attack; when this\r\nwas finished he handed the letter to Mike, who was waiting patiently by,\r\nhoping for light, and requested him to read it.\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear!\" chuckled Mr. Barley, \"five pounds! They may teach you\r\nyoung gentlemen to talk Latin and Greek and what-not at your school, but\r\nit 'ud do a lot more good if they'd teach you how many beans make five;\r\nit 'ud do a lot more good if they'd teach you to come in when it rained;\r\nit 'ud do ...\"\r\n\r\nMike was reading the letter.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mr. Barley,\" it ran.\r\n\r\n\"I send the £5, which I could not get before. I hope it is in time,\r\nbecause I don't want you to write to the headmaster. I am sorry Jane and\r\nJohn ate your wife's hat and the chicken and broke the vase.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some more to the same effect; it was signed \"T.G. Jellicoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth's it all about?\" said Mike, finishing this curious\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nMr. Barley slapped his leg. \"Why, Mr. Jellicoe keeps two dogs here; I\r\nkeep 'em for him till the young gentlemen go home for their holidays.\r\nAberdeen terriers, they are, and as sharp as mustard. Mischief! I\r\nbelieve you, but, love us! they don't do no harm! Bite up an old shoe\r\nsometimes and such sort of things. The other day, last Wednesday it\r\nwere, about 'ar parse five, Jane--she's the worst of the two, always up\r\nto it, she is--she got hold of my old hat and had it in bits before you\r\ncould say knife. John upset a china vase in one of the bedrooms chasing\r\na mouse, and they got on the coffee-room table and ate half a cold\r\nchicken what had been left there. So I says to myself, 'I'll have a game\r\nwith Mr. Jellicoe over this,' and I sits down and writes off saying the\r\nlittle dogs have eaten a valuable hat and a chicken and what not, and\r\nthe damage'll be five pounds, and will he kindly remit same by Saturday\r\nnight at the latest or I write to his headmaster. Love us!\" Mr. Barley\r\nslapped his thigh, \"he took it all in, every word--and here's the five\r\npounds in cash in this envelope here! I haven't had such a laugh since\r\nwe got old Tom Raxley out of bed at twelve of a winter's night by\r\ntelling him his house was afire.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to appreciate a joke of the practical order if one\r\nhas been made even merely part victim of it. Mike, as he reflected that\r\nhe had been dragged out of his house in the middle of the night, in\r\ncontravention of all school rules and discipline, simply in order to\r\nsatisfy Mr. Barley's sense of humor, was more inclined to be abusive\r\nthan mirthful. Running risks is all very well when they are necessary,\r\nor if one chooses to run them for one's own amusement, but to be placed\r\nin a dangerous position, a position imperiling one's chance of going to\r\nthe 'Varsity, is another matter altogether.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to abuse the Barley type of man. Barley's enjoyment\r\nof the whole thing was so honest and childlike. Probably it had given\r\nhim the happiest quarter of an hour he had known for years, since, in\r\nfact, the affair of old Tom Raxley. It would have been cruel to damp\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nSo Mike laughed perfunctorily, took back the envelope with the five\r\npounds, accepted a ginger beer and a plateful of biscuits, and rode off\r\non his return journey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMention has been made above of the difference which exists between\r\ngetting into an inn after lockup and into a private house. Mike was to\r\nfind this out for himself.\r\n\r\nHis first act on arriving at Sedleigh was to replace his bicycle in the\r\nshed. This he accomplished with success. It was pitch-dark in the shed,\r\nand as he wheeled his machine in, his foot touched something on the\r\nfloor. Without waiting to discover what this might be, he leaned his\r\nbicycle against the wall, went out, and locked the door, after which he\r\nran across to Outwood's.\r\n\r\nFortune had favored his undertaking by decreeing that a stout drainpipe\r\nshould pass up the wall within a few inches of his and Psmith's study.\r\nOn the first day of term, it may be remembered he had wrenched away the\r\nwooden bar which bisected the window frame, thus rendering exit and\r\nentrance almost as simple as they had been for Wyatt during Mike's first\r\nterm at Wrykyn.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to scale this water pipe.\r\n\r\nHe had got about halfway up when a voice from somewhere below cried,\r\n\"Who's that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nPURSUIT\r\n\r\n\r\nThese things are Life's Little Difficulties. One can never tell\r\nprecisely how one will act in a sudden emergency. The right thing for\r\nMike to have done at this crisis was to have ignored the voice, carried\r\non up the water pipe, and through the study window, and gone to bed. It\r\nwas extremely unlikely that anybody could have recognized him at night\r\nagainst the dark background of the house. The position then would have\r\nbeen that somebody in Mr. Outwood's house had been seen breaking in\r\nafter lights-out; but it would have been very difficult for the\r\nauthorities to have narrowed the search down any further than that.\r\nThere were thirty-four boys in Outwood's, of whom about fourteen were\r\nmuch the same size and build as Mike.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness, however, of the call caused Mike to lose his head. He\r\nmade the strategic error of sliding rapidly down the pipe, and running.\r\n\r\nThere were two gates to Mr. Outwood's front garden. The drive ran in a\r\nsemicircle, of which the house was the center. It was from the\r\nright-hand gate, nearest to Mr. Downing's house, that the voice had\r\ncome, and, as Mike came to the ground, he saw a stout figure galloping\r\ntoward him from that direction. He bolted like a rabbit for the other\r\ngate. As he did so, his pursuer again gave tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Oo-oo-oo yer!\" was the exact remark.\r\n\r\nWhereby Mike recognized him as the school sergeant. \"Oo-oo-oo yer!\" was\r\nthat militant gentleman's habitual way of beginning a conversation.\r\n\r\nWith this knowledge, Mike felt easier in his mind. Sergeant Collard was\r\na man of many fine qualities (notably a talent for what he was wont to\r\ncall \"spott'n,\" a mysterious gift which he exercised on the rifle\r\nrange), but he could not run. There had been a time in his hot youth\r\nwhen he had sprinted like an untamed mustang in pursuit of volatile\r\nPathans in Indian hill wars, but Time, increasing his girth, had taken\r\nfrom him the taste for such exercise. When he moved now it was at a\r\nstately walk. The fact that he ran tonight showed how the excitement of\r\nthe chase had entered into his blood.\r\n\r\n\"Oo-oo-oo yer!\" he shouted again, as Mike, passing through the gate,\r\nturned into the road that led to the school. Mike's attentive ear noted\r\nthat the bright speech was a shade more puffily delivered this time. He\r\nbegan to feel that this was not such bad fun after all. He would have\r\nliked to be in bed, but, if that was out of the question, this was\r\ncertainly the next-best thing.\r\n\r\nHe ran on, taking things easily, with the sergeant panting in his wake,\r\ntill he reached the entrance to the school grounds. He dashed in and\r\ntook cover behind a tree.\r\n\r\nPresently the sergeant turned the corner, going badly and evidently\r\ncured of a good deal of the fever of the chase. Mike heard him toil on\r\nfor a few yards and then stop. A sound of panting was borne to him.\r\n\r\nThen the sound of footsteps returning, this time at a walk. They passed\r\nthe gate and went on down the road.\r\n\r\nThe pursuer had given the thing up.\r\n\r\nMike waited for several minutes behind his tree. His program now was\r\nsimple. He would give Sergeant Collard about half an hour, in case the\r\nlatter took it into his head to \"guard home\" by waiting at the gate.\r\nThen he would trot softly back, shoot up the water pipe once more, and\r\nso to bed. It had just struck a quarter to something--twelve, he\r\nsupposed--on the school clock. He would wait till a quarter past.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there was nothing to be gained from lurking behind a tree. He\r\nleft his cover, and started to stroll in the direction of the pavilion.\r\nHaving arrived there, he sat on the steps, looking out onto the\r\ncricket field.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts were miles away, at Wrykyn, when he was recalled to\r\nSedleigh by the sound of somebody running. Focusing his gaze, he saw a\r\ndim figure moving rapidly across the cricket field straight for him.\r\n\r\nHis first impression, that he had been seen and followed, disappeared as\r\nthe runner, instead of making for the pavilion, turned aside, and\r\nstopped at the door of the bicycle shed. Like Mike, he was evidently\r\npossessed of a key, for Mike heard it grate in the lock. At this point\r\nhe left the pavilion and hailed his fellow rambler by night in a\r\ncautious undertone.\r\n\r\nThe other appeared startled.\r\n\r\n\"Who the dickens is that?\" he asked. \"Is that you, Jackson?\"\r\n\r\nMike recognized Adair's voice. The last person he would have expected to\r\nmeet at midnight obviously on the point of going for a bicycle ride.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing out here. Jackson?\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you, if it comes to that?\"\r\n\r\nAdair was adjusting his front light.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going for the doctor. One of the chaps in our house is bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just been for a stroll.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't you better be getting back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you think you're doing something tremendously brave and\r\ndashing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't you better be going to the doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to know what I think--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't. So long.\"\r\n\r\nMike turned away, whistling between his teeth. After a moment's pause,\r\nAdair rode off. Mike saw his light pass across the field and through the\r\ngate. The school clock struck the quarter.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Mike that Sergeant Collard, even if he had started to wait\r\nfor him at the house, would not keep up the vigil for more than half an\r\nhour. He would be safe now in trying for home again.\r\n\r\nHe walked in that direction.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that Mr. Downing, aroused from his first sleep by the\r\nnews, conveyed to him by Adair, that MacPhee, one of the junior members\r\nof Adair's dormitory, was groaning and exhibiting other symptoms of\r\nacute illness, was disturbed in his mind. Most housemasters feel uneasy\r\nin the event of illness in their houses, and Mr. Downing was apt to get\r\njumpy beyond the ordinary on such occasions. All that was wrong with\r\nMacPhee, as a matter of fact, was a very fair stomachache, the direct\r\nand legitimate result of eating six buns, half a coconut, three\r\ndoughnuts, two ices, an apple, and a pound of cherries, and washing the\r\nlot down with tea. But Mr. Downing saw in his attack the beginnings of\r\nsome deadly scourge which would sweep through and decimate the house. He\r\nhad dispatched Adair for the doctor, and, after spending a few minutes\r\nprowling restlessly about his room, was now standing at his front gate,\r\nwaiting for Adair's return.\r\n\r\nIt came about, therefore, that Mike, sprinting lightly in the direction\r\nof home and safety, had his already shaken nerves further maltreated by\r\nbeing hailed, at a range of about two yards, with a cry of \"Is that you,\r\nAdair?\" The next moment Mr. Downing emerged from his gate.\r\n\r\nMike stood not upon the order of his going. He was off like an arrow--a\r\nflying figure of Guilt. Mr. Downing, after the first surprise, seemed to\r\ngrasp the situation. Ejaculating at intervals the words, \"Who is that?\r\nStop! Who is that? Stop!\" he dashed after the much-enduring Wrykynian at\r\nan extremely creditable rate of speed. Mr. Downing was by way of being a\r\nsprinter. He had won handicap events at College sports at Oxford, and,\r\nif Mike had not got such a good start, the race might have been over in\r\nthe first fifty yards. As it was, that victim of Fate, going well, kept\r\nahead. At the entrance to the school grounds he led by a dozen yards.\r\nThe procession passed into the field, Mike heading as before for\r\nthe pavilion.\r\n\r\nAs they raced across the soft turf, an idea occurred to Mike, which he\r\nwas accustomed in after years to attribute to genius, the one flash of\r\nit which had ever illumined his life.\r\n\r\nIt was this.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Downing's first acts, on starting the Fire Brigade at\r\nSedleigh, had been to institute an alarm bell. It had been rubbed into\r\nthe school officially--in speeches from the dais--by the headmaster, and\r\nunofficially--in earnest private conversations--by Mr. Downing, that at\r\nthe sound of this bell, at whatever hour of day or night, every member\r\nof the school must leave his house in the quickest possible way, and\r\nmake for the open. The bell might mean that the school was on fire, or\r\nit might mean that one of the houses was on fire. In any case, the\r\nschool had its orders--to get out into the open at once.\r\n\r\nNor must it be supposed that the school was without practice at this\r\nfeat. Every now and then a notice would be found posted up on the board\r\nto the effect that there would be fire drill during the dinner hour that\r\nday. Sometimes the performance was bright and interesting, as on the\r\noccasion when Mr. Downing, marshaling the brigade at his front gate, had\r\nsaid, \"My house is supposed to be on fire. Now let's do a record!\" which\r\nthe Brigade, headed by Stone and Robinson, obligingly did. They fastened\r\nthe hose to the hydrant, smashed a window on the ground floor (Mr.\r\nDowning having retired for a moment to talk with the headmaster), and\r\npoured a stream of water into the room. When Mr. Downing was at liberty\r\nto turn his attention to the matter, he found that the room selected was\r\nhis private study, most of the light furniture of which was floating in\r\na miniature lake. That episode had rather discouraged his passion for\r\nrealism, and fire drill since then had taken the form, for the most\r\npart, of \"practicing escaping.\" This was done by means of canvas chutes,\r\nkept in the dormitories. At the sound of the bell the prefect of the\r\ndormitory would heave one end of the chute out of the window, the other\r\nend being fastened to the sill. He would then go down it himself, using\r\nhis elbows as a brake. Then the second man would follow his example, and\r\nthese two, standing below, would hold the end of the chute so that the\r\nrest of the dormitory could fly rapidly down it without injury, except\r\nto their digestions.\r\n\r\nAfter the first novelty of the thing had worn off, the school had taken\r\na rooted dislike to fire drill. It was a matter for self-congratulation\r\namong them that Mr. Downing had never been able to induce the headmaster\r\nto allow the alarm bell to be sounded for fire drill at night. The\r\nheadmaster, a man who had his views on the amount of sleep necessary for\r\nthe growing boy, had drawn the line at night operations. \"Sufficient\r\nunto the day\" had been the gist of his reply. If the alarm bell were to\r\nring at night when there was no fire, the school might mistake a genuine\r\nalarm of fire for a bogus one, and refuse to hurry themselves.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Downing had had to be content with day drill.\r\n\r\nThe alarm bell hung in the archway, leading into the school grounds. The\r\nend of the rope, when not in use, was fastened to a hook halfway up\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nMike, as he raced over the cricket field, made up his mind in a flash\r\nthat his only chance of getting out of this tangle was to shake his\r\npursuer off for a space of time long enough to enable him to get to the\r\nrope and tug it. Then the school would come out. He would mix with them,\r\nand in the subsequent confusion get back to bed unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe task was easier than it would have seemed at the beginning of the\r\nchase. Mr. Downing, owing to the two facts that he was not in the\r\nstrictest training, and that it is only a Bannister who can run for any\r\nlength of time at top speed shouting \"Who is that? Stop! Who is that?\r\nStop!\" was beginning to feel distressed. There were bellows to mend in\r\nthe Downing camp. Mike perceived this, and forced the pace. He rounded\r\nthe pavilion ten yards to the good. Then, heading for the gate, he put\r\nall he knew into one last sprint. Mr. Downing was not equal to the\r\neffort. He worked gamely for a few strides, then fell behind. When Mike\r\nreached the gate, a good forty yards separated them.\r\n\r\nAs far as Mike could judge--he was not in a condition to make nice\r\ncalculations--he had about four seconds in which to get busy with that\r\nbell rope.\r\n\r\nProbably nobody has ever crammed more energetic work into four seconds\r\nthan he did then.\r\n\r\nThe night was as still as only an English summer night can be, and the\r\nfirst clang of the clapper sounded like a million iron girders falling\r\nfrom a height onto a sheet of tin. He tugged away furiously, with an eye\r\non the now rapidly advancing and loudly shouting figure of the\r\nhousemaster.\r\n\r\nAnd from the darkened house beyond there came a gradually swelling hum,\r\nas if a vast hive of bees had been disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe school was awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nTHE DECORATION OF SAMMY\r\n\r\n\r\nPsmith leaned against the mantelpiece in the senior day room at\r\nOutwood's--since Mike's innings against Downing's the Lost Lambs had\r\nbeen received as brothers by the center of disorder, so that even\r\nSpiller was compelled to look on the hatchet as buried--and gave his\r\nviews on the events of the preceding night, or, rather, of that morning,\r\nfor it was nearer one than twelve when peace had once more fallen on\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that happens in this loony bin,\" said Psmith, \"has power to\r\nsurprise me now. There was a time when I might have thought it a little\r\nunusual to have to leave the house through a canvas chute at one o'clock\r\nin the morning, but I suppose it's quite the regular thing here. Old\r\nschool tradition, etc. Men leave the school, and find that they've got\r\nso accustomed to jumping out of windows that they look on it as a sort\r\nof affectation to go out by the door. I suppose none of you merchants\r\ncan give me any idea when the next knockabout entertainment of this kind\r\nis likely to take place?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder who rang that bell!\" said Stone. \"Jolly sporting idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it was Downing himself. If it was, I hope he's satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nJellicoe, who was appearing in society supported by a stick, looked\r\nmeaningly at Mike, and giggled, receiving in answer a stony stare. Mike\r\nhad informed Jellicoe of the details of his interview with Mr. Barley at\r\nthe White Boar, and Jellicoe, after a momentary splutter of wrath\r\nagainst the practical joker, was now in a particular lighthearted mood.\r\nHe hobbled about, giggling at nothing and at peace with all the world.\r\n\r\n\"It was a stirring scene,\" said Psmith. \"The agility with which Comrade\r\nJellicoe boosted himself down the chute was a triumph of mind over\r\nmatter. He seemed to forget his ankle. It was the nearest thing to a\r\nBoneless Acrobatic Wonder that I have ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in a beastly funk, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\nStone gurgled.\r\n\r\n\"So was I,\" he said, \"for a bit. Then, when I saw that it was all a rag,\r\nI began to look about for ways of doing the thing really well. I emptied\r\nabout six jugs of water on a gang of kids under my window.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rushed into Downing's, and ragged some of the beds,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"It was an invigorating time,\" said Psmith. \"A sort of pageant. I was\r\nparticularly struck with the way some of the bright lads caught hold of\r\nthe idea. There was no skimping. Some of the kids, to my certain\r\nknowledge, went down the chute a dozen times. There's nothing like doing\r\na thing thoroughly. I saw them come down, rush upstairs, and be saved\r\nagain, time after time. The thing became chronic with them. I should say\r\nComrade Downing ought to be satisfied with the high state of efficiency\r\nto which he has brought us. At any rate I hope--\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door, and Sharpe, a\r\nmember of the senior day room, burst excitedly in. He seemed amused.\r\n\r\n\"I say, have you chaps seen Sammy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seen who?\" said Stone. \"Sammy? Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll know in a second. He's just outside. Here, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy!\r\nSam! Sam!\"\r\n\r\nA bark and a patter of feet outside.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Sammy. Good dog.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence. Then a great yell of laughter burst forth.\r\nEven Psmith's massive calm was shattered. As for Jellicoe, he sobbed\r\nin a corner.\r\n\r\nSammy's beautiful white coat was almost entirely concealed by a thick\r\ncovering of bright-red paint. His head, with the exception of the ears,\r\nwas untouched, and his serious, friendly eyes seemed to emphasise the\r\nweirdness of his appearance. He stood in the doorway, barking and\r\nwagging his tail, plainly puzzled at his reception. He was a popular\r\ndog, and was always well received when he visited any of the houses, but\r\nhe had never before met with enthusiasm like this.\r\n\r\n\"Good old Sammy!\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth's been happening to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did it?\"\r\n\r\nSharpe, the introducer, had no views on the matter.\r\n\r\n\"I found him outside Downing's, with a crowd round him. Everybody seems\r\nto have seen him. I wonder who on earth has gone and mucked him up\r\nlike that!\"\r\n\r\nMike was the first to show any sympathy for the maltreated animal.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Sammy,\" he said, kneeling on the floor beside the victim, and\r\nscratching him under the ear. \"What a beastly shame! It'll take hours to\r\nwash all that off him, and he'll hate it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Psmith, regarding Sammy dispassionately through\r\nhis eyeglass, \"that it's not a case for mere washing. They'll either\r\nhave to skin him bodily, or leave the thing to time. Time, the Great\r\nHealer. In a year or two he'll fade to a delicate pink. I don't see why\r\nyou shouldn't have a pink bull terrier. It would lend a touch of\r\ndistinction to the place. Crowds would come in excursion trains to see\r\nhim. By charging a small fee you might make him self-supporting. I think\r\nI'll suggest it to Comrade Downing.\"\r\n\r\n\"There'll be a row about this,\" said Stone.\r\n\r\n\"Rows are rather sport when you're not mixed up in them,\" said Robinson,\r\nphilosophically. \"There'll be another if we don't start off for chapel\r\nsoon. It's a quarter to.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general move. Mike was the last to leave the room. As he was\r\ngoing, Jellicoe stopped him. Jellicoe was staying in that Sunday, owing\r\nto his ankle.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Jellicoe, \"I just wanted to thank you again about that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but it really was awfully decent of you. You might have got into a\r\nfrightful row. Were you nearly caught?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jolly nearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _was_ you who rang the bell, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was. But for goodness' sake don't go gassing about it, or\r\nsomebody will get to hear who oughtn't to, and I shall be sacked.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. But, I say, you _are_ a chap!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean about Sammy, you know. It's a jolly good score off old Downing.\r\nHe'll be frightfully sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sammy!\" cried Mike. \"My good man, you don't think I did that, do you?\r\nWhat absolute rot! I never touched the poor brute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right,\" said Jellicoe. \"But I wasn't going to tell anyone, of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ a chap!\" giggled Jellicoe.\r\n\r\nMike walked to chapel rather thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nMR. DOWNING ON THE SCENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was just one moment, the moment in which, on going down to the\r\njunior day room of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance, he was\r\nboisterously greeted by a vermilion bull terrier, when Mr. Downing was\r\nseized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses. Glaring down at\r\nthe crimson animal that was pawing at his knees, he clutched at his\r\nreason for one second as a drowning man clutches at a life belt.\r\n\r\nThen the happy laughter of the young onlookers reassured him.\r\n\r\n\"Who--\" he shouted, \"WHO has done this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, we don't know,\" shrilled the chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, he came in like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, we were sitting here when he suddenly ran in, all red.\"\r\n\r\nA voice from the crowd: \"Look at old Sammy!\"\r\n\r\nThe situation was impossible. There was nothing to be done. He could not\r\nfind out by verbal inquiry who had painted the dog. The possibility of\r\nSammy being painted red during the night had never occurred to Mr.\r\nDowning, and now that the thing had happened he had no scheme of action.\r\nAs Psmith would have said, he had confused the unusual with the\r\nimpossible, and the result was that he was taken by surprise.\r\n\r\nWhile he was pondering on this, the situation was rendered still more\r\ndifficult by Sammy, who, taking advantage of the door being open,\r\nescaped and rushed into the road, thus publishing his condition to all\r\nand sundry. You can hush up a painted dog while it confines itself to\r\nyour own premises, but once it has mixed with the great public, this\r\nbecomes out of the question. Sammy's state advanced from a private\r\ntrouble into a row. Mr. Downing's next move was in the same direction\r\nthat Sammy had taken, only, instead of running about the road, he went\r\nstraight to the headmaster.\r\n\r\nThe Head, who had had to leave his house in the small hours in his\r\npajamas and a dressing gown, was not in the best of tempers. He had a\r\ncold in the head, and also a rooted conviction that Mr. Downing, in\r\nspite of his strict orders, had rung the bell himself on the previous\r\nnight in order to test the efficiency of the school in saving themselves\r\nin the event of fire. He received the housemaster frostily, but thawed\r\nas the latter related the events which had led up to the ringing of\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" he said, deeply interested. \"One of the boys at the school,\r\nyou think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am certain of it,\" said Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"Was he wearing a school cap?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was bareheaded. A boy who breaks out of his house at night would\r\nhardly run the risk of wearing a distinguishing cap.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I suppose not. A big boy, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very big.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not see his face?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was dark and he never looked back--he was in front of me all the\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is another matter ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"This boy, whoever he was, had done something before he rang the\r\nbell--he had painted my dog Sampson red.\"\r\n\r\nThe headmaster's eyes protruded from their sockets. \"He--he--_what_, Mr.\r\nDowning?\"\r\n\r\n\"He painted my dog red--bright red.\" Mr. Downing was too angry to see\r\nanything humorous in the incident. Since the previous night he had been\r\nwounded in his tenderest feelings, his Fire Brigade system had been most\r\nshamefully abused by being turned into a mere instrument in the hands of\r\na malefactor for escaping justice, and his dog had been held up to\r\nridicule to all the world. He did not want to smile; he wanted revenge.\r\n\r\nThe headmaster, on the other hand, did want to smile. It was not his\r\ndog, he could look on the affair with an unbiased eye, and to him there\r\nwas something ludicrous in a white dog suddenly appearing as a red dog.\r\n\r\n\"It is a scandalous thing!\" said Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so! Quite so!\" said the headmaster hastily. \"I shall punish the\r\nboy who did it most severely. I will speak to the school in the Hall\r\nafter chapel.\"\r\n\r\nWhich he did, but without result. A cordial invitation to the criminal\r\nto come forward and be executed was received in wooden silence by the\r\nschool, with the exception of Johnson III, of Outwood's, who, suddenly\r\nreminded of Sammy's appearance by the headmaster's words, broke into a\r\nwild screech of laughter, and was instantly awarded two hundred lines.\r\n\r\nThe school filed out of the Hall to their various lunches, and Mr.\r\nDowning was left with the conviction that, if he wanted the criminal\r\ndiscovered, he would have to discover him for himself.\r\n\r\nThe great thing in affairs of this kind is to get a good start, and\r\nFate, feeling perhaps that it had been a little hard upon Mr. Downing,\r\ngave him a most magnificent start. Instead of having to hunt for a\r\nneedle in a haystack, he found himself in a moment in the position of\r\nbeing set to find it in a mere truss of straw.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Outwood who helped him. Sergeant Collard had waylaid the\r\narchaeological expert on his way to chapel, and informed him that at\r\nclose on twelve the night before he had observed a youth, unidentified,\r\nattempting to get into his house _via_ the water pipe. Mr. Outwood,\r\nwhose thoughts were occupied with apses and plinths, not to mention\r\ncromlechs, at the time, thanked the sergeant with absent minded\r\npoliteness and passed on. Later he remembered the fact apropos of some\r\nreflections on the subject of burglars in medieval England, and passed\r\nit on to Mr. Downing as they walked back to lunch.\r\n\r\n\"Then the boy was in your house!\" exclaimed Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"Not actually in, as far as I understand. I gather from the sergeant\r\nthat he interrupted him before--\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean he must have been one of the boys in your house.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what was he doing out at that hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had broken out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, I think. Oh yes, quite impossible! I went around the\r\ndormitories as usual at eleven o'clock last night, and all the boys were\r\nasleep--all of them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was not listening. He was in a state of suppressed\r\nexcitement and exultation, which made it hard for him to attend to his\r\ncolleague's slow utterances. He had a clue! Now that the search had\r\nnarrowed itself down to Outwood's house, the rest was comparatively\r\neasy. Perhaps Sergeant Collard had actually recognized the boy. On\r\nreflection he dismissed this as unlikely, for the sergeant would\r\nscarcely have kept a thing like that to himself; but he might very well\r\nhave seen more of him than he, Downing, had seen. It was only with an\r\neffort that he could keep himself from rushing to the sergeant then and\r\nthere, and leaving the house lunch to look after itself. He resolved to\r\ngo the moment that meal was at an end.\r\n\r\nSunday lunch at a public-school house is probably one of the longest\r\nfunctions in existence. It drags its slow length along like a languid\r\nsnake, but it finishes in time. In due course Mr. Downing, after sitting\r\nstill and eyeing with acute dislike everybody who asked for a second\r\nhelping, found himself at liberty.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the claims of digestion, he rushed forth on the trail.\r\n\r\nSergeant Collard lived with his wife and a family of unknown dimensions\r\nin the lodge at the school front gate. Dinner was just over when Mr.\r\nDowning arrived, as a blind man could have told.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant received his visitor with dignity, ejecting the family, who\r\nwere torpid after roast beef and resented having to move, in order to\r\nensure privacy.\r\n\r\nHaving requested his host to smoke, which the latter was about to do\r\nunasked, Mr. Downing stated his case.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Outwood,\" he said, \"tells me that last night, Sergeant, you saw a\r\nboy endeavoring to enter his house.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant blew a cloud of smoke. \"Oo-oo-oo, yer,\" he said; \"I did,\r\nsir--spotted 'im, I did. Feeflee good at spottin', I am, sir. Dook of\r\nConnaught, he used to say, ''Ere comes Sergeant Collard,' 'e used to\r\nsay, ''e's feeflee good at spottin'.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do? Oo-oo-oo! I shouts 'Oo-oo-oo yer, yer young monkey, what yer doin'\r\nthere?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"But 'e was off in a flash, and I doubles after 'im prompt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you didn't catch him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" admitted the sergeant reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\"Did you catch sight of his face, Sergeant?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, 'e was doublin' away in the opposite direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you notice anything at all about his appearance?\"\r\n\r\n\"'E was a long young chap, sir, with a pair of legs on him--feeflee fast\r\n'e run, sir. Oo-oo-oo, feeflee!\"\r\n\r\n\"You noticed nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"'E wasn't wearing no cap of any sort, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bare'eaded, sir,\" added the sergeant, rubbing the point in.\r\n\r\n\"It was undoubtedly the same boy, undoubtedly! I wish you could have\r\ncaught a glimpse of his face, Sergeant.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not be able to recognize him again if you saw him, you\r\nthink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oo-oo-oo! Wouldn't go as far as to say that, sir, 'cos yer see, I'm\r\nfeeflee good at spottin', but it was a dark night.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing rose to go.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"the search is now considerably narrowed down,\r\nconsiderably! It is certain that the boy was one of the boys in Mr.\r\nOutwood's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young monkeys!\" interjected the sergeant helpfully\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, Sergeant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon to you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do not move, Sergeant.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant had not shown the slightest inclination of doing anything\r\nof the kind.\r\n\r\n\"I will find my way out. Very hot today, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Feeflee warm, sir; weather's goin' to break' workin' up for thunder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not. The school plays the M.C.C. on Wednesday, and it would be a\r\npity if rain were to spoil our first fixture with them. Good afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Downing went out into the baking sunlight, while Sergeant\r\nCollard, having requested Mrs. Collard to take the children out for a\r\nwalk at once, and furthermore to give young Ernie a clip side of the\r\n'ead, if he persisted in making so much noise, put a handkerchief over\r\nhis face, rested his feet on the table, and slept the sleep of the just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nTHE SLEUTH-HOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Doctor Watsons of this world, as opposed to the Sherlock\r\nHolmeses, success in the province of detective work must be, to a very\r\nlarge extent, the result of luck. Sherlock Holmes can extract a clue\r\nfrom a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash. But Doctor Watson has got\r\nto have it taken out for him, and dusted, and exhibited clearly, with a\r\nlabel attached.\r\n\r\nThe average man is a Doctor Watson. We are wont to scoff in a\r\npatronizing manner at that humbler follower of the great investigator,\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, we should have been just as dull ourselves. We\r\nshould not even have risen to the modest level of a Scotland Yard\r\nbungler. We should simply have hung around, saying: \"My dear Holmes,\r\nhow...?\" and all the rest of it, just as the downtrodden medico did.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that the ordinary person has any need to see what he can\r\ndo in the way of detection. He gets along very comfortably in the\r\nhumdrum round of life without having to measure footprints and smile\r\nquiet, tight-lipped smiles. But if ever the emergency does arise, he\r\nthinks naturally of Sherlock Holmes, and his methods.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing had read all the Holmes stories with great attention, and\r\nhad thought many times what an incompetent ass Doctor Watson was; but,\r\nnow that he had started to handle his own first case, he was compelled\r\nto admit that there was a good deal to be said in extenuation of\r\nWatson's inability to unravel tangles. It certainly was uncommonly hard,\r\nhe thought, as he paced the cricket field after leaving Sergeant\r\nCollard, to detect anybody, unless you knew who had really done the\r\ncrime. As he brooded over the case in hand, his sympathy for Doctor\r\nWatson increased with every minute, and he began to feel a certain\r\nresentment against Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was all very well for Sir\r\nArthur to be so shrewd and infallible about tracing a mystery to its\r\nsource, but he knew perfectly well who had done the thing before\r\nhe started!\r\n\r\nNow that he began really to look into this matter of the alarm bell and\r\nthe painting of Sammy, the conviction was creeping over him that the\r\nproblem was more difficult than a casual observer might imagine. He had\r\ngot as far as finding that his quarry of the previous night was a boy in\r\nMr. Outwood's house, but how was he to get any further? That was the\r\nthing. There was, of course, only a limited number of boys in Mr.\r\nOutwood's house as tall as the one he had pursued; but even if there had\r\nbeen only one other, it would have complicated matters. If you go to a\r\nboy and say, \"Either you or Jones were out of your house last night at\r\ntwelve o'clock,\" the boy does not reply, \"Sir, I cannot tell a lie--I\r\nwas out of my house last night at twelve o'clock.\" He simply assumes the\r\nanimated expression of a stuffed fish, and leaves the next move to you.\r\nIt is practically stalemate.\r\n\r\nAll these things passed through Mr. Downing's mind as he walked up and\r\ndown the cricket field that afternoon.\r\n\r\nWhat he wanted was a clue. But it is so hard for the novice to tell what\r\nis a clue and what isn't. Probably, if he only knew, there were clues\r\nlying all over the place, shouting to him to pick them up.\r\n\r\nWhat with the oppressive heat of the day and the fatigue of hard\r\nthinking, Mr. Downing was working up for a brainstorm when Fate once\r\nmore intervened, this time in the shape of Riglett, a junior member of\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\nRiglett slunk up in the shamefaced way peculiar to some boys, even when\r\nthey have done nothing wrong, and, having \"capped\" Mr. Downing with the\r\nair of one who had been caught in the act of doing something\r\nparticularly shady, requested that he might be allowed to fetch his\r\nbicycle from the shed.\r\n\r\n\"Your bicycle?\" snapped Mr. Downing. Much thinking had made him\r\nirritable. \"What do you want with your bicycle?\"\r\n\r\nRiglett shuffled, stood first on his left foot, then on his right,\r\nblushed, and finally remarked, as if it were not so much a sound reason\r\nas a sort of feeble excuse for the low and blackguardly fact that he\r\nwanted his bicycle, that he had got leave for tea that afternoon.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Downing remembered. Riglett had an aunt resident about three\r\nmiles from the school, whom he was accustomed to visit occasionally on\r\nSunday afternoons during the term.\r\n\r\nHe felt for his bunch of keys, and made his way to the shed, Riglett\r\nshambling behind at an interval of two yards.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing unlocked the door, and there on the floor was the Clue!\r\n\r\nA clue that even Doctor Watson could not have overlooked.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing saw it, but did not immediately recognize it for what it\r\nwas. What he saw at first was not a clue, but just a mess. He had a tidy\r\nsoul and abhorred messes. And this was a particularly messy mess. The\r\ngreater part of the flooring in the neighborhood of the door was a sea\r\nof red paint. The tin from which it had flowed was lying on its side in\r\nthe middle of the shed. The air was full of the pungent scent.\r\n\r\n\"Pah!\" said Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, beneath the disguise of the mess, he saw the clue. A\r\nfootmark! No less. A crimson footmark on the gray concrete!\r\n\r\nRiglett, who had been waiting patiently two yards away, now coughed\r\nplaintively. The sound recalled Mr. Downing to mundane matters.\r\n\r\n\"Get your bicycle, Riglett,\" he said, \"and be careful where you tread.\r\nSomebody has upset a pot of paint on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nRiglett, walking delicately through dry places, extracted his bicycle\r\nfrom the rack, and presently departed to gladden the heart of his aunt,\r\nleaving Mr. Downing, his brain fizzing with the enthusiasm of the\r\ndetective, to lock the door and resume his perambulation of the\r\ncricket field.\r\n\r\nGive Doctor Watson a fair start, and he is a demon at the game. Mr.\r\nDowning's brain was now working with a rapidity and clearness which a\r\nprofessional sleuth might have envied.\r\n\r\nPaint. Red paint. Obviously the same paint with which Sammy had been\r\ndecorated. A footmark. Whose footmark? Plainly that of the criminal who\r\nhad done the deed of decoration.\r\n\r\nYoicks!\r\n\r\nThere were two things, however, to be considered. Your careful detective\r\nmust consider everything. In the first place, the paint might have been\r\nupset by the groundsman. It was the groundsman's paint. He had been\r\ngiving a fresh coating to the woodwork in front of the pavilion scoring\r\nbox at the conclusion of yesterday's match. (A labor of love which was\r\nthe direct outcome of the enthusiasm for work which Adair had instilled\r\ninto him.) In that case the footmark might be his.\r\n\r\n_Note one_: Interview the groundsman on this point.\r\n\r\nIn the second place Adair might have upset the tin and trodden in its\r\ncontents when he went to get his bicycle in order to fetch the doctor\r\nfor the suffering MacPhee. This was the more probable of the two\r\ncontingencies, for it would have been dark in the shed when Adair\r\nwent into it.\r\n\r\n_Note two_: Interview Adair as to whether he found, on returning to the\r\nhouse, that there was paint on his shoes.\r\n\r\nThings were moving.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe resolved to take Adair first. He could get the groundsman's address\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nPassing by the trees under whose shade Mike and Psmith and Dunster had\r\nwatched the match on the previous day, he came upon the Head of his\r\nhouse in a deck chair reading a book. A summer Sunday afternoon is the\r\ntime for reading in deck chairs.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Adair,\" he said. \"No, don't get up. I merely wished to ask you if\r\nyou found any paint on your shoes when you returned to the house\r\nlast night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paint, sir?\" Adair was plainly puzzled. His book had been interesting,\r\nand had driven the Sammy incident out of his head.\r\n\r\n\"I see somebody has spilled some paint on the floor of the bicycle shed.\r\nYou did not do that, I suppose, when you went to fetch your bicycle?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is spilled all over the floor. I wondered whether you had happened\r\nto tread in it. But you say you found no paint on your shoes\r\nthis morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, my bicycle is always quite near the door of the shed. I didn't\r\ngo into the shed at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. Quite so. Thank you, Adair. Oh, by the way, Adair, where does\r\nMarkby live?\"\r\n\r\n\"I forget the name of his cottage, sir, but I could show you in a\r\nsecond. It's one of those cottages just past the school gates, on the\r\nright as you turn out into the road. There are three in a row. His is\r\nthe first you come to. There's a barn just before you get to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I shall be able to find them. I should like to speak to\r\nMarkby for a moment on a small matter.\"\r\n\r\nA sharp walk took him to the cottages Adair had mentioned. He rapped at\r\nthe door of the first, and the groundsman came out in his shirt sleeves,\r\nblinking as if he had just waked up, as was indeed the case.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Markby!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You remember that you were painting the scoring box in the pavilion\r\nlast night after the match?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. It wanted a lick of paint bad. The young gentlemen will\r\nscramble about and get through the window. Makes it look shabby, sir. So\r\nI thought I'd better give it a coating so as to look shipshape when the\r\nMarylebone come down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so. An excellent idea. Tell me, Markby, what did you do with the\r\npot of paint when you had finished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it in the bicycle shed, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the floor?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the floor, sir? No. On the shelf at the far end, with the can of\r\nwhitening what I use for marking out the wickets, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, yes. Quite so. Just as I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want it, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, Markby, no, thank you. The fact is, somebody who had no\r\nbusiness to do so has moved the pot of paint from the shelf to the\r\nfloor, with the result that it has been kicked over and spilled. You had\r\nbetter get some more tomorrow. Thank you, Markby. That is all I\r\nwished to know.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing walked back to the school thoroughly excited. He was hot on\r\nthe scent now. The only other possible theories had been tested and\r\nsuccessfully exploded. The thing had become simple to a degree. All he\r\nhad to do was to go to Mr. Outwood's house--the idea of searching a\r\nfellow master's house did not appear to him at all a delicate task;\r\nsomehow one grew unconsciously to feel that Mr. Outwood did not really\r\nexist as a man capable of resenting liberties--find the paint-splashed\r\nshoe, ascertain its owner, and denounce him to the headmaster. There\r\ncould be no doubt that a paint-splashed shoe must be in Mr. Outwood's\r\nhouse somewhere. A boy cannot tread in a pool of paint without showing\r\nsome signs of having done so. It was Sunday, too, so that the shoe would\r\nnot yet have been cleaned. Yoicks! Also tally-ho! This really was\r\nbeginning to be something like business.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the heat, the sleuth-hound hurried across to Outwood's as\r\nfast as he could walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nA CHECK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only two members of the house not out in the grounds when he arrived\r\nwere Mike and Psmith. They were standing on the gravel drive in front of\r\nthe boys' entrance. Mike had a deck chair in one hand and a book in the\r\nother. Psmith--for even the greatest minds will sometimes unbend--was\r\nwrestling with a Yo-Yo. That is to say, he was trying without success to\r\nkeep the spool spinning. He smoothed a crease out of his waistcoat and\r\ntried again. He had just succeeded in getting the thing to spin when Mr.\r\nDowning arrived. The sound of his footsteps disturbed Psmith and brought\r\nthe effort to nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Enough of this spoolery,\" said he, flinging the spool through the open\r\nwindow of the senior day room. \"I was an ass ever to try it. The\r\nphilosophical mind needs complete repose in its hours of\r\nleisure. Hello!\"\r\n\r\nHe stared after the sleuth-hound, who had just entered the house.\r\n\r\n\"What the dickens,\" said Mike, \"does he mean by barging in as if he'd\r\nbought the place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Comrade Downing looks pleased with himself. What brings him around in\r\nthis direction, I wonder! Still, no matter. The few articles which he\r\nmay sneak from our study are of inconsiderable value. He is welcome to\r\nthem. Do you feel inclined to wait awhile till I have fetched a chair\r\nand book?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be going on. I shall be under the trees at the far end of the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis well. I will be with you in about two ticks.\"\r\n\r\nMike walked on toward the field, and Psmith, strolling upstairs to fetch\r\nhis novel, found Mr. Downing standing in the passage with the air of one\r\nwho has lost his bearings.\r\n\r\n\"A warm afternoon, sir,\" murmured Psmith courteously, as he passed.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Smith!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--er--wish to go round the dormitories.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Psmith's guiding rule in life never to be surprised at anything,\r\nso he merely inclined his head gracefully, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad if you would fetch the keys and show me where the\r\nrooms are.\"\r\n\r\n\"With acute pleasure, sir,\" said Psmith. \"Or shall I fetch Mr. Outwood,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do as I tell you Smith,\" snapped Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\nPsmith said no more, but went down to the matron's room. The matron\r\nbeing out, he abstracted the bunch of keys from her table and rejoined\r\nthe master.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I lead the way, sir?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Here, sir,\" said Psmith, opening the door, \"we have Barnes's dormitory.\r\nAn airy room, constructed on the soundest hygienic principles. Each boy,\r\nI understand, has quite a considerable number of cubic feet of air all\r\nto himself. It is Mr. Outwood's boast that no boy has ever asked for a\r\ncubic foot of air in vain. He argues justly--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off abruptly and began to watch the other's maneuvers in\r\nsilence. Mr. Downing was peering rapidly beneath each bed in turn.\r\n\r\n\"Are you looking for Barnes, sir?\" inquired Psmith politely. \"I think\r\nhe's out in the field.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing rose, having examined the last bed, crimson in the face with\r\nthe exercise.\r\n\r\n\"Show me the next dormitory, Smith,\" he said, panting slightly.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Psmith, opening the next door and sinking his voice to an\r\nawed whisper, \"is where _I_ sleep!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing glanced swiftly beneath the three beds.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said Psmith, \"but are we chasing anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be good enough, Smith,\" said Mr. Downing with asperity, \"to keep your\r\nremarks to yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was only wondering sir. Shall I show you the next in order?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved on up the passage.\r\n\r\nDrawing blank at the last dormitory, Mr. Downing paused, baffled. Psmith\r\nwaited patiently by. An idea struck the master.\r\n\r\n\"The studies, Smith,\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" said Psmith. \"I beg your pardon, sir. The observation escaped me\r\nunawares. The frenzy of the chase is beginning to enter into my blood.\r\nHere we have--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"Is this impertinence studied, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ferguson's study, sir? No, sir. That's farther down the passage. This\r\nis Barnes's.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing looked at him closely. Psmith's face was wooden in its\r\ngravity. The master snorted suspiciously, then moved on.\r\n\r\n\"Whose is this?\" he asked, rapping a door.\r\n\r\n\"This, sir, is mine and Jackson's.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Have you a study? You are low down in the school for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, sir, that Mr. Outwood gave it us rather as a testimonial to\r\nour general worth than to our proficiency in schoolwork.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing raked the room with a keen eye. The absence of bars from the\r\nwindow attracted his attention.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no bars to your windows here, such as there are in my house?\"\r\n\r\n\"There appears to be no bar, sir,\" said Psmith, putting up his eyeglass.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was leaning out of the window.\r\n\r\n\"A lovely view, is it not, sir?\" said Psmith. \"The trees, the field, the\r\ndistant hills ...\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing suddenly started. His eye had been caught by the water pipe\r\nat the side of the window. The boy whom Sergeant Collard had seen\r\nclimbing the pipe must have been making for this study.\r\n\r\nHe spun around and met Psmith's blandly inquiring gaze. He looked at\r\nPsmith carefully for a moment. No. The boy he had chased last night had\r\nnot been Psmith. That exquisite's figure and general appearance were\r\nunmistakable, even in the dusk.\r\n\r\n\"Whom did you say you shared this study with, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jackson, sir. The cricketer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind about his cricket, Smith,\" said Mr. Downing with irritation.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the only other occupant of the room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody else comes into it?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they do, they go out extremely quickly, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Thank you, Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing pondered. Jackson! The boy bore him a grudge. The boy was\r\nprecisely the sort of boy to revenge himself by painting the dog Sammy.\r\nAnd, gadzooks! The boy whom he had pursued last night had been just\r\nabout Jackson's size and build!\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was as firmly convinced at that moment that Mike's had been\r\nthe hand to wield the paintbrush as he had ever been of anything in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n\"Smith!\" he said excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"On the spot, sir,\" said Psmith affably.\r\n\r\n\"Where are Jackson's shoes?\"\r\n\r\nThere are moments when the giddy excitement of being right on the trail\r\ncauses the amateur (or Watsonian) detective to be incautious. Such a\r\nmoment came to Mr. Downing then. If he had been wise, he would have\r\nachieved his object, the getting a glimpse of Mike's shoes, by a devious\r\nand snaky route. As it was, he rushed straight on.\r\n\r\n\"His shoes, sir? He has them on. I noticed them as he went out just\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the pair he wore yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the shoes of yesteryear?\" murmured Psmith to himself. \"I\r\nshould say at a venture, sir, that they would be in the basket,\r\ndownstairs. Edmund, our genial knife-and-boot boy, collects them, I\r\nbelieve, at early dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would they have been cleaned yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I know Edmund, sir--no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smith,\" said Mr. Downing, trembling with excitement, \"go and bring that\r\nbasket to me here.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith's brain was working rapidly as he went downstairs. What exactly\r\nwas at the back of the sleuth's mind, prompting these maneuvers, he did\r\nnot know. But that there was something, and that that something was\r\ndirected in a hostile manner against Mike, probably in connection with\r\nlast night's wild happenings, he was certain. Psmith had noticed, on\r\nleaving his bed at the sound of the alarm bell, that he and Jellicoe\r\nwere alone in the room. That might mean that Mike had gone out through\r\nthe door when the bell sounded, or it might mean that he had been out\r\nall the time. It began to look as if the latter solution were the\r\ncorrect one.\r\n\r\nHe staggered back with the basket, painfully conscious all the while\r\nthat it was creasing his waistcoat, and dumped it down on the study\r\nfloor. Mr. Downing stooped eagerly over it. Psmith leaned against the\r\nwall, and straightened out the damaged garment.\r\n\r\n\"We have here, sir,\" he said, \"a fair selection of our various\r\nbootings.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing looked up.\r\n\r\n\"You dropped none of the shoes on your way up, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one, sir. It was a fine performance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing uttered a grunt of satisfaction, and bent once more to his\r\ntask. Shoes flew about the room. Mr. Downing knelt on the floor beside\r\nthe basket, and dug like a terrier at a rathole.\r\n\r\nAt last he made a dive, and, with an exclamation of triumph, rose to his\r\nfeet. In his hand he held a shoe.\r\n\r\n\"Put those back again, Smith,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Etonian, wearing an expression such as a martyr might have worn\r\non being told off for the stake, began to pick up the scattered\r\nfootgear, whistling softly the tune of \"I do all the dirty work,\" as\r\nhe did so.\r\n\r\n\"That's the lot, sir,\" he said, rising.\r\n\r\n\"Ah. Now come across with me to the headmaster's house. Leave the basket\r\nhere. You can carry it back when you return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I put back that shoe, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. I shall take this with me, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I carry it, sir?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing reflected.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Smith,\" he said. \"I think it would be best.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that the spectacle of a house master wandering abroad\r\non the public highway, carrying a dirty shoe, might be a trifle\r\nundignified. You never knew whom you might meet on Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nPsmith took the shoe, and doing so, understood what before had puzzled\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAcross the toe of the shoe was a broad splash of red paint.\r\n\r\nHe knew nothing, of course, of the upset tin in the bicycle shed; but\r\nwhen a housemaster's dog has been painted red in the night, and when, on\r\nthe following day, the housemaster goes about in search of a paint\r\nsplashed shoe, one puts two and two together. Psmith looked at the name\r\ninside the shoe. It was \"Brown bootmaker, Bridgnorth.\" Bridgnorth was\r\nonly a few miles from his own home and Mike's. Undoubtedly it was\r\nMike's shoe.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me whose shoe that is?\" asked Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\nPsmith looked at it again.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. I can't say the little chap's familiar to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with me, then.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing left the room. After a moment Psmith followed him.\r\n\r\nThe headmaster was in his garden. Thither Mr. Downing made his way, the\r\nshoe-bearing Psmith in close attendance.\r\n\r\nThe Head listened to the amateur detective's statement with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" he said, when Mr. Downing had finished, \"Indeed? Dear me! It\r\ncertainly seems ... It is a curiously well-connected thread of evidence.\r\nYou are certain that there was red paint on this shoe you discovered in\r\nMr. Outwood's house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it with me. I brought it on purpose to show to you. Smith!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have the shoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the headmaster, putting on a pair of pince-nez, \"now let me\r\nlook at--This, you say, is the--? Just so. Just so. Just ... But, er,\r\nMr. Downing, it may be that I have not examined this shoe with\r\nsufficient care, but--Can _you_ point out to me exactly where this paint\r\nis that you speak of?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing stood staring at the shoe with a wild, fixed stare. Of any\r\nsuspicion of paint, red or otherwise, it was absolutely and\r\nentirely innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nTHE DESTROYER OF EVIDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shoe became the center of attention, the cynosure of all eyes. Mr.\r\nDowning fixed it with the piercing stare of one who feels that his brain\r\nis tottering. The headmaster looked at it with a mildly puzzled\r\nexpression. Psmith, putting up his eyeglass, gazed at it with a sort of\r\naffectionate interest, as if he were waiting for it to do a trick of\r\nsome kind.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n\"There was paint on this shoe,\" he said vehemently. \"I tell you there\r\nwas a splash of red paint across the toe. Smith will bear me out in\r\nthis. Smith, you saw the paint on this shoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Paint, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Do you mean to tell me that you did _not_ see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. There was no paint on this shoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is foolery. I saw it with my own eyes. It was a broad splash right\r\nacross the toe.\"\r\n\r\nThe headmaster interposed.\r\n\r\n\"You must have made a mistake, Mr. Downing. There is certainly no trace\r\nof paint on this shoe. These momentary optical delusions are, I fancy,\r\nnot uncommon. Any doctor will tell you--\"\r\n\r\n\"I had an aunt, sir,\" said Psmith chattily, \"who was remarkably\r\nsubject--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is absurd. I cannot have been mistaken,\" said Mr. Downing. \"I am\r\npositively certain the toe of this shoe was red when I found it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is undoubtedly black now, Mr. Downing.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sort of chameleon shoe,\" murmured Psmith.\r\n\r\nThe goaded housemaster turned on him.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I speak, sir?\" said Psmith, with the start of one coming suddenly\r\nout of a trance.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing looked searchingly at him.\r\n\r\n\"You had better be careful, Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I strongly suspect you of having something to do with this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Mr. Downing,\" said the headmaster, \"this is surely improbable.\r\nSmith could scarcely have cleaned the shoe on his way to my house. On\r\none occasion I inadvertently spilled some paint on a shoe of my own. I\r\ncan assure you that it does not brush off. It needs a very systematic\r\ncleaning before all traces are removed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, sir,\" said Psmith. \"My theory, if I may...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly Smith.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith bowed courteously and proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"My theory, sir, is that Mr. Downing was deceived by the light-and-shade\r\neffects on the toe of the shoe. The afternoon sun, streaming in through\r\nthe window, must have shone on the shoe in such a manner as to give it a\r\nmomentary and fictitious aspect of redness. If Mr. Downing recollects,\r\nhe did not look long at the shoe. The picture on the retina of the eye,\r\nconsequently, had not time to fade. I remember thinking myself, at the\r\nmoment, that the shoe appeared to have a certain reddish tint. The\r\nmistake....\"\r\n\r\n\"Bag!\" said Mr. Downing shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, really,\" said the headmaster, \"it seems to me that that is the\r\nonly explanation that will square with the facts. A shoe that is really\r\nsmeared with red paint does not become black of itself in the course of\r\na few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very right, sir,\" said Psmith with benevolent approval. \"May I\r\ngo now, sir? I am in the middle of a singularly impressive passage of\r\nCicero's speech _De senectute_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that you should leave your preparation till Sunday, Smith.\r\nIt is a habit of which I altogether disapprove.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am reading it, sir,\" said Psmith, with simple dignity, \"for pleasure.\r\nShall I take the shoe with me, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"If Mr. Downing does not want it?\"\r\n\r\nThe housemaster passed the fraudulent piece of evidence to Psmith\r\nwithout a word, and the latter, having included both masters in a kindly\r\nsmile, left the garden.\r\n\r\nPedestrians who had the good fortune to be passing along the road\r\nbetween the headmaster's house and Mr. Outwood's at that moment saw\r\nwhat, if they had but known it, was a most unusual sight, the spectacle\r\nof Psmith running. Psmith's usual mode of progression was a dignified\r\nwalk. He believed in the contemplative style rather than the hustling.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, however, reckless of possible injuries to the crease\r\nof his trousers, he raced down the road, and turning in at Outwood's\r\ngate, bounded upstairs like a highly trained professional athlete.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the study, his first act was to remove a shoe from the\r\ntop of the pile in the basket, place it in the small cupboard under the\r\nbookshelf, and lock the cupboard. Then he flung himself into a chair\r\nand panted.\r\n\r\n\"Brain,\" he said to himself approvingly, \"is what one chiefly needs in\r\nmatters of this kind. Without brain, where are we? In the soup, every\r\ntime. The next development will be when Comrade Downing thinks it over,\r\nand is struck with the brilliant idea that it's just possible that the\r\nshoe he gave me to carry and the shoe I did carry were not one shoe but\r\ntwo shoes. Meanwhile ...\"\r\n\r\nHe dragged up another chair for his feet and picked up his novel.\r\n\r\nHe had not been reading long when there was a footstep in the passage,\r\nand Mr. Downing appeared.\r\n\r\nThe possibility, in fact the probability, of Psmith's having substituted\r\nanother shoe for the one with the incriminating splash of paint on it\r\nhad occurred to him almost immediately on leaving the headmaster's\r\ngarden. Psmith and Mike, he reflected, were friends. Psmith's impulse\r\nwould be to do all that lay in his power to shield Mike. Feeling\r\naggrieved with himself that he had not thought of this before, he, too,\r\nhurried over to Outwood's.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was brisk and peremptory.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to look at these shoes again,\" he said. Psmith, with a sigh,\r\nlaid down his novel, and rose to assist him.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Smith,\" said the housemaster. \"I can manage without your\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith sat down again, carefully tucking up the knees of his trousers,\r\nand watched him with silent interest through his eyeglass.\r\n\r\nThe scrutiny irritated Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"Put that thing away, Smith,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That thing, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that ridiculous glass. Put it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why! Because I tell you to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guessed that that was the reason, sir,\" sighed Psmith, replacing the\r\neyeglass in his waistcoat pocket. He rested his elbows on his knees, and\r\nhis chin on his hands, and resumed his contemplative inspection of the\r\nshoe expert, who, after fidgeting for a few moments, lodged another\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n\"Don't sit there staring at me, Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was interested in what you were doing, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. Don't stare at me in that idiotic way.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I read, sir?\" asked Psmith, patiently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, read if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith took up his book again, and Mr. Downing, now thoroughly\r\nirritated, pursued his investigations in the boot basket.\r\n\r\nHe went through it twice, but each time without success. After the\r\nsecond search, he stood up, and looked wildly round the room. He was as\r\ncertain as he could be of anything that the missing piece of evidence\r\nwas somewhere in the study. It was no use asking Psmith point-blank\r\nwhere it was, for Psmith's ability to parry dangerous questions with\r\nevasive answers was quite out of the common.\r\n\r\nHis eye roamed about the room. There was very little cover there, even\r\nfor so small a fugitive as a number nine shoe. The floor could be\r\nacquitted, on sight, of harboring the quarry.\r\n\r\nThen he caught sight of the cupboard, and something seemed to tell him\r\nthat there was the place to look.\r\n\r\n\"Smith!\" he said.\r\n\r\nPsmith had been reading placidly all the while.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is in this cupboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"That cupboard, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. This cupboard.\" Mr. Downing rapped the door irritably.\r\n\r\n\"Just a few odd trifles, sir. We do not often use it. A ball of string,\r\nperhaps. Possibly an old notebook. Nothing of value or interest.\r\n\r\n\"Open it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you will find that it is locked, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unlock it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is the key, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not got the key?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the key is not in the lock, sir, you may depend upon it that it will\r\ntake a long search to find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you see it last?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was in the lock yesterday morning. Jackson might have taken it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Jackson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out in the field somewhere, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" he said shortly. \"I have my reasons for\r\nthinking that you are deliberately keeping the contents of that cupboard\r\nfrom me. I shall break open the door.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith got up.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you mustn't do that, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing stared, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"Are you aware whom you are talking to, Smith?\" he inquired icily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. And I know it's not Mr. Outwood, to whom that cupboard\r\nhappens to belong. If you wish to break it open, you must get his\r\npermission. He is the sole lessee and proprietor of that cupboard. I am\r\nonly the acting manager.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing paused. He also reflected. Mr. Outwood in the general rule\r\ndid not count much in the scheme of things, but possibly there were\r\nlimits to the treating of him as if he did not exist. To enter his house\r\nwithout his permission and search it to a certain extent was all very\r\nwell. But when it came to breaking up his furniture, perhaps...!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there was the maddening thought that if he left the\r\nstudy in search of Mr. Outwood, in order to obtain his sanction for the\r\nhouse-breaking work which he proposed to carry through, Smith would be\r\nalone in the room. And he knew that if Smith were left alone in the\r\nroom, he would instantly remove the shoe to some other hiding place. He\r\nthoroughly disbelieved the story of the lost key. He was perfectly\r\nconvinced that the missing shoe was in the cupboard.\r\n\r\nHe stood chewing these thoughts for a while, Psmith in the meantime\r\nstanding in a graceful attitude in front of the cupboard, staring\r\ninto vacancy.\r\n\r\nThen he was seized with a happy idea. Why should he leave the room at\r\nall? If he sent Smith, then he himself could wait and make certain that\r\nthe cupboard was not tampered with.\r\n\r\n\"Smith,\" he said, \"go and find Mr. Outwood, and ask him to be good\r\nenough to come here for a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nMAINLY ABOUT SHOES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Be quick, Smith,\" he said, as the latter stood looking at him without\r\nmaking any movement in the direction of the door.\r\n\r\n\"_Quick_, sir?\" said Psmith meditatively, as if he had been asked a\r\nconundrum.\r\n\r\n\"Go and find Mr. Outwood at once.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith still made no move.\r\n\r\n\"Do you intend to disobey me, Smith?\" Mr. Downing's voice was steely.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one of those you-could-have-heard-a-pin-drop silences. Psmith\r\nwas staring reflectively at the ceiling. Mr. Downing was looking as if\r\nat any moment he might say, \"Thwarted to me face, ha, ha! And by a very\r\nstripling!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Psmith, however, who resumed the conversation. His manner was\r\nalmost too respectful; which made it all the more a pity that what he\r\nsaid did not keep up the standard of docility.\r\n\r\n\"I take my stand,\" he said, \"on a technical point. I say to myself, 'Mr.\r\nDowning is a man I admire as a human being and respect as a\r\nmaster. In--'\"\r\n\r\n\"This impertinence is doing you no good, Smith.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith waved a hand deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\"If you will let me explain, sir. I was about to say that in any other\r\nplace but Mr. Outwood's house, your word would be law. I would fly to do\r\nyour bidding. If you pressed a button, I would do the rest. But in Mr.\r\nOutwood's house I cannot do anything except what pleases me or what is\r\nordered by Mr. Outwood. I ought to have remembered that before. One\r\ncannot,\" he continued, as who should say, \"Let us be reasonable,\" \"one\r\ncannot, to take a parallel case, imagine the colonel commanding the\r\ngarrison at a naval station going on board a battleship and ordering the\r\ncrew to splice the jibboom spanker. It might be an admirable thing for\r\nthe Empire that the jibboom spanker _should_ be spliced at that\r\nparticular juncture, but the crew would naturally decline to move in the\r\nmatter until the order came from the commander of the ship. So in my\r\ncase. If you will go to Mr. Outwood, explain to him how matters stand,\r\nand come back and say to me, 'Psmith, Mr. Outwood wishes you to ask him\r\nto be good enough to come to this study,' then I shall be only too glad\r\nto go and find him. You see my difficulty, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and fetch Mr. Outwood, Smith. I shall not tell you again.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith flicked a speck of dust from his coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you, sir, at any rate, that if there is a shoe in that\r\ncupboard now, there will be a shoe there when you return.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing stalked out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" added Psmith pensively to himself, as the footsteps died away, \"I\r\ndid not promise that it would be the same shoe.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the key from his pocket, unlocked the cupboard, and took out the\r\nshoe. Then he selected from the basket a particularly battered specimen.\r\nPlacing this in the cupboard, he relocked the door.\r\n\r\nHis next act was to take from the shelf a piece of string. Attaching one\r\nend of this to the shoe that he had taken from the cupboard, he went to\r\nthe window. His first act was to fling the cupboard key out into the\r\nbushes. Then he turned to the shoe. On a level with the sill the water\r\npipe, up which Mike had started to climb the night before, was fastened\r\nto the wall by an iron band. He tied the other end of the string to\r\nthis, and let the shoe swing free. He noticed with approval, when it had\r\nstopped swinging, that it was hidden from above by the windowsill.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his place at the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nAs an afterthought he took another shoe from the basket, and thrust it\r\nup the chimney. A shower of soot fell into the grate, blackening\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom was a few yards down the corridor. He went there, and\r\nwashed off the soot.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned, Mr. Downing was in the study, and with him Mr.\r\nOutwood, the latter looking dazed, as if he were not quite equal to the\r\nintellectual pressure of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been, Smith?\" asked Mr. Downing sharply.\r\n\r\n\"I have been washing my hands, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" said Mr. Downing suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw Smith go into the bathroom,\" said Mr. Outwood. \"Smith, I\r\ncannot quite understand what it is Mr. Downing wishes me to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Outwood,\" snapped the sleuth, \"I thought I had made it\r\nperfectly clear. Where is the difficulty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand why you should suspect Smith of keeping his shoes\r\nin a cupboard, and,\" added Mr. Outwood with spirit, catching sight of a\r\ngood-gracious-has-the-man-_no_-sense look on the other's face, \"Why he\r\nshould not do so if he wishes it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, sir,\" said Psmith, approvingly. \"You have touched the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I must explain again, my dear Outwood, will you kindly give me your\r\nattention for a moment. Last night a boy broke out of your house, and\r\npainted my dog Sampson red.\"\r\n\r\n\"He painted...!\" said Mr. Outwood, round-eyed. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why. At any rate, he did. During the escapade one of his\r\nshoes was splashed with the paint. It is that shoe which I believe Smith\r\nto be concealing in this cupboard. Now, do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Outwood looked amazedly at Psmith, and Psmith shook his head\r\nsorrowfully at Mr. Outwood. Psmith's expression said, as plainly as if\r\nhe had spoken the words, \"We must humor him.\"\r\n\r\n\"So with your permission, as Smith declares that he has lost the key, I\r\npropose to break open the door of this cupboard. Have you any\r\nobjection?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Outwood started.\r\n\r\n\"Objection? None at all, my dear fellow, none at all. Let me see, _what_\r\nis it you wish to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Mr. Downing shortly.\r\n\r\nThere was a pair of dumbbells on the floor, belonging to Mike. He never\r\nused them, but they always managed to get themselves packed with the\r\nrest of his belongings on the last day of the holidays. Mr. Downing\r\nseized one of these, and delivered two rapid blows at the cupboard door.\r\nThe wood splintered. A third blow smashed the flimsy lock. The cupboard,\r\nwith any skeletons it might contain, was open for all to view.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing uttered a cry of triumph, and tore the shoe from its resting\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"I told you,\" he said. \"I told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wondered where that shoe had got to,\" said Psmith. \"I've been looking\r\nfor it for days.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was examining his find. He looked up with an exclamation of\r\nsurprise and wrath.\r\n\r\n\"This shoe has no paint on it,\" he said, glaring at Psmith. \"This is not\r\nthe shoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly appears, sir,\" said Psmith sympathetically, \"to be free\r\nfrom paint. There's a sort of reddish glow just there, if you look at it\r\nsideways,\" he added helpfully.\r\n\r\n\"Did you place that shoe there, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have done. Then, when I lost the key--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you satisfied now, Downing?\" interrupted Mr. Outwood with asperity,\r\n\"or is there any more furniture you wish to break?\"\r\n\r\nThe excitement of seeing his household goods smashed with a dumbbell had\r\nmade the archaeological student quite a swashbuckler for the moment. A\r\nlittle more, and one could imagine him giving Mr. Downing a good,\r\nhard knock.\r\n\r\nThe sleuth-hound stood still for a moment, baffled. But his brain was\r\nworking with the rapidity of a buzz saw. A chance remark of Mr.\r\nOutwood's set him fizzing off on the trail once more. Mr. Outwood had\r\ncaught sight of the little pile of soot in the grate. He bent down to\r\ninspect it.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me,\" he said, \"I must remember to have the chimneys swept. It\r\nshould have been done before.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing's eye, rolling in a fine frenzy from heaven to earth, from\r\nearth to heaven, also focused itself on the pile of soot; and a thrill\r\nwent through him. Soot in the fireplace! Smith washing his hands! (\"You\r\nknow my methods, my dear Watson. Apply them.\")\r\n\r\nMr. Downing's mind at that moment contained one single thought; and that\r\nthought was, \"What ho for the chimney!\"\r\n\r\nHe dived forward with a rush, nearly knocking Mr. Outwood off his feet,\r\nand thrust an arm up into the unknown. An avalanche of soot fell upon\r\nhis hand and wrist, but he ignored it, for at the same instant his\r\nfingers had closed upon what he was seeking.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he said. \"I thought as much. You were not quite clever enough,\r\nafter all, Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Psmith patiently. \"We all make mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have done better, Smith, not to have given me all this\r\ntrouble. You have done yourself no good by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's been great fun, though, sir,\" argued Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"Fun!\" Mr. Downing laughed grimly. \"You may have reason to change your\r\nopinion of what constitutes--\"\r\n\r\nHis voice failed as his eye fell on the all-black toe of the shoe. He\r\nlooked up, and caught Psmith's benevolent gaze. He straightened himself\r\nand brushed a bead of perspiration from his face with the back of his\r\nhand. Unfortunately, he used the sooty hand, and the result was that he\r\nlooked like a chimney sweep at work.\r\n\r\n\"Did--you--put--that--shoe--there, Smith?\" he asked slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what did you _MEAN_ by putting it there?\" roared Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"Animal spirits, sir,\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"WHAT?\"\r\n\r\n\"Animal spirits, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Downing would have replied to this one cannot tell, though one\r\ncan guess roughly. For, just as he was opening his mouth, Mr. Outwood,\r\ncatching sight of his soot-covered countenance, intervened.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Downing,\" he said, \"your face. It is positively covered with\r\nsoot, positively. You must come and wash it. You are quite black. Really\r\nyou present a most curious appearance, most. Let me show you the way\r\nto my room.\"\r\n\r\nIn all times of storm and tribulation there comes a breaking point, a\r\npoint where the spirit definitely refuses to battle any longer against\r\nthe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Mr. Downing could not bear\r\nup against this crowning blow. He went down beneath it. In the language\r\nof the ring, he took the count. It was the knockout.\r\n\r\n\"Soot!\" he murmured weakly. \"Soot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your face is covered, my dear fellow, quite covered.\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly has a faintly sooty aspect, sir,\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\nHis voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker of spirit.\r\n\r\n\"You will hear more of this, Smith,\" he said. \"I say you will hear more\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nThen he allowed Mr. Outwood to lead him out to a place where there were\r\ntowels, soap, and sponges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone, Psmith went to the window, and hauled in the string.\r\nHe felt the calm afterglow which comes to the general after a\r\nsuccessfully conducted battle. It had been trying, of course, for a man\r\nof refinement, and it had cut into his afternoon, but on the whole it\r\nhad been worth it.\r\n\r\nThe problem now was what to do with the painted shoe. It would take a\r\nlot of cleaning, he saw, even if he could get hold of the necessary\r\nimplements for cleaning it. And he rather doubted if he would be able to\r\ndo so. Edmund, the boot-boy, worked in some mysterious cell far from the\r\nmadding crowd, at the back of the house. In the boot cupboard downstairs\r\nthere would probably be nothing likely to be of any use.\r\n\r\nHis fears were realized. The boot cupboard was empty. It seemed to him\r\nthat, for the time being, the best thing he could do would be to place\r\nthe shoe in safe hiding, until he would have thought out a scheme.\r\n\r\nHaving restored the basket to its proper place, accordingly, he went up\r\nto the study again, and placed the red-toed shoe in the chimney, at\r\nabout the same height where Mr. Downing had found the other. Nobody\r\nwould think of looking there a second time, and it was improbable that\r\nMr. Outwood really would have the chimneys swept, as he had said. The\r\nodds were that he had forgotten about it already.\r\n\r\nPsmith went to the bathroom to wash his hands again, with the feeling\r\nthat he had done a good day's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\nON THE TRAIL AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most massive minds are apt to forget things at times. The most\r\nadroit plotters make their little mistakes. Psmith was no exception to\r\nthe rule. He made the mistake of not telling Mike of the afternoon's\r\nhappenings.\r\n\r\nIt was not altogether forgetfulness. Psmith was one of those people who\r\nlike to carry through their operations entirely by themselves. Where\r\nthere is only one in a secret, the secret is more liable to remain\r\nunrevealed. There was nothing, he thought, to be gained from telling\r\nMike. He forgot what the consequences might be if he did not.\r\n\r\nSo Psmith kept his own counsel, with the result that Mike went over to\r\nschool on the Monday morning in gym shoes.\r\n\r\nEdmund, summoned from the hinterland of the house to give his opinion\r\nwhy only one of Mike's shoes was to be found, had no views on the\r\nsubject. He seemed to look on it as one of these things which no fellow\r\ncan understand.\r\n\r\n\"'Ere's one of 'em, Mr. Jackson,\" he said, as if he hoped that Mike\r\nmight be satisfied with a compromise.\r\n\r\n\"One? What's the good of that, Edmund, you chump? I can't go over to\r\nschool in one shoe.\"\r\n\r\nEdmund turned this over in his mind, and then said, \"No, sir,\" as much\r\nas to say, \"I may have lost a shoe, but, thank goodness, I can still\r\nunderstand sound reasoning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what am I to do? Where _is_ the other shoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know, Mr. Jackson,\" replied Edmund to both questions.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I mean ... Oh, dash it, there's the bell.\" And Mike sprinted off\r\nin the gym shoes he stood in.\r\n\r\nIt is only a deviation from those ordinary rules of school life, which\r\none observes naturally and without thinking, that enables one to realize\r\nhow strong public-school prejudices really are. At a school, for\r\ninstance, where the regulations say that coats only of black or dark\r\nblue are to be worn, a boy who appears one day in even the most\r\nrespectable and unostentatious brown finds himself looked on with a\r\nmixture of awe and repulsion, which would be excessive if he had\r\nsandbagged the headmaster. So in the case of shoes. School rules decree\r\nthat a boy shall go to his form room in shoes. There is no real reason\r\nwhy, if the day is fine, he should not wear gym shoes, should he prefer\r\nthem. But, if he does, the thing creates a perfect sensation. Boys say,\r\n\"Great Scott, what _have_ you got on?\" Masters say, \"Jones, _what_ are\r\nyou wearing on your feet?\" In the few minutes which elapse between the\r\nassembling of the form for call-over and the arrival of the form master,\r\nsome wag is sure either to stamp on the gym shoes, accompanying the act\r\nwith some satirical remark, or else to pull one of them off, and\r\ninaugurate an impromptu game of football with it. There was once a boy\r\nwho went to school one morning in elastic-sided boots.\r\n\r\nMike had always been coldly distant in his relations to the rest of his\r\nform, looking on them, with a few exceptions, as worms; and the form,\r\nsince his innings against Downing's on the Friday, had regarded Mike\r\nwith respect. So that he escaped the ragging he would have had to\r\nundergo at Wrykyn in similar circumstance. It was only Mr. Downing who\r\ngave trouble.\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of instinct which enables some masters to tell when a\r\nboy in their form is wearing gym shoes instead of the more formal kind,\r\njust as people who dislike cats always know when one is in a room with\r\nthem. They cannot see it but they feel it in their bones.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing was perhaps the most bigoted anti-gym-shoeist in the whole\r\nlist of English schoolmasters. He waged war remorselessly against gym\r\nshoes. Satire, abuse, lines, detention--every weapon was employed by him\r\nin dealing with their wearers. It had been the late Dunster's practice\r\nalways to go over to school in gym shoes when, as he usually did, he\r\nfelt shaky in the morning's lesson. Mr. Downing always detected him in\r\nthe first five minutes, and that meant a lecture of anything from ten\r\nminutes to a quarter of an hour on Untidy Habits and Boys Who Looked\r\nLike Loafers--which broke the back of the morning's work nicely. On one\r\noccasion, when a particularly tricky bit of Livy was on the bill of\r\nfare, Dunster had entered the form room in heelless Turkish bath\r\nslippers, of a vivid crimson; and the subsequent proceedings, including\r\nhis journey over to the house to change the heelless atrocities, had\r\nseen him through very nearly to the quarter-to-eleven interval.\r\n\r\nMike, accordingly, had not been in his place for three minutes when Mr.\r\nDowning, stiffening like a pointer, called his name.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"_What_ are you wearing on your feet, Jackson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gym shoes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wearing gym shoes? Are you not aware that gym shoes are not the\r\nproper things to come to school in? Why are you wearing gym shoes?\"\r\n\r\nThe form, leaning back against the next row of desks, settled itself\r\ncomfortably for the address from the throne.\r\n\r\n\"I have lost one of my shoes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nA kind of gulp escaped from Mr. Downing's lips. He stared at Mike for a\r\nmoment in silence. Then, turning to Stone, he told him to start\r\ntranslating.\r\n\r\nStone, who had been expecting at least ten minutes' respite, was taken\r\nunawares. When he found the place in his book and began to construe, he\r\nfloundered hopelessly. But, to his growing surprise and satisfaction,\r\nthe form master appeared to notice nothing wrong. He said \"Yes, yes,\"\r\nmechanically, and finally, \"That will do,\" whereupon Stone resumed his\r\nseat with the feeling that the age of miracles had returned.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing's mind was in a whirl. His case was complete. Mike's\r\nappearance in gym shoes, with the explanation that he had lost a shoe,\r\ncompleted the chain. As Columbus must have felt when his ship ran into\r\nharbor, and the first American interviewer, jumping on board, said,\r\n\"Wal, sir, and what are your impressions of our glorious country?\" so\r\ndid Mr. Downing feel at that moment.\r\n\r\nWhen the bell rang at a quarter to eleven, he gathered up his gown and\r\nsped to the headmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nTHE ADAIR METHOD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during the interval that day that Stone and Robinson, discussing\r\nthe subject of cricket over a bun and ginger beer at the school shop,\r\ncame to a momentous decision, to wit, that they were fed up with the\r\nAdair administration and meant to strike. The immediate cause of revolt\r\nwas early-morning fielding practice, that searching test of cricket\r\nkeenness. Mike himself, to whom cricket was the great and serious\r\ninterest in life, had shirked early-morning fielding practice in his\r\nfirst term at Wrykyn. And Stone and Robinson had but a lukewarm\r\nattachment to the game, compared with Mike's.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, Adair had contented himself with practice in the afternoon\r\nafter school, which nobody objects to; and no strain, consequently, had\r\nbeen put upon Stone's and Robinson's allegiance. In view of the M.C.C.\r\nmatch on the Wednesday, however, he had now added to this an extra dose\r\nto be taken before breakfast. Stone and Robinson had left their\r\ncomfortable beds that day at six o'clock, yawning and heavy-eyed, and\r\nhad caught catches and fielded drives which, in the cool morning air,\r\nhad stung like adders and bitten like serpents. Until the sun has really\r\ngot to work, it is no joke taking a high catch. Stone's dislike of the\r\nexperiment was only equaled by Robinson's. They were neither of them of\r\nthe type which likes to undergo hardships for the common good. They\r\nplayed well enough when on the field, but neither cared greatly whether\r\nthe school had a good season or not. They played the games entirely for\r\ntheir own sakes.\r\n\r\nThe result was that they went back to the house for breakfast with a\r\nnever-again feeling, and at the earliest possible moment met to debate\r\nas to what was to be done about it. At all costs another experience like\r\ntoday's must be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"It's all rot,\" said Stone. \"What on earth's the good of sweating about\r\nbefore breakfast? It only makes you tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder,\" said Robinson, \"if it wasn't bad for the heart.\r\nRushing about on an empty stomach, I mean, and all that sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Personally,\" said Stone, gnawing his bun, \"I don't intend to stick it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, it's such absolute rot. If we aren't good enough to play for\r\nthe team without having to get up overnight to catch catches, he'd\r\nbetter find somebody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Adair came into the shop.\r\n\r\n\"Fielding practice again tomorrow,\" he said briskly, \"at six.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before breakfast?\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"Rather. You two must buck up, you know. You were rotten today.\" And he\r\npassed on, leaving the two malcontents speechless.\r\n\r\nStone was the first to recover.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hanged if I turn out tomorrow,\" he said, as they left the shop. \"He\r\ncan do what he likes about it. Besides, what can he do, after all? Only\r\nkick us out of the team. And I don't mind that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think he will kick us out, either. He can't play the M.C.C.\r\nwith a scratch team. If he does, we'll go and play for that village\r\nJackson plays for. We'll get Jackson to shove us into the team.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Robinson. \"Let's.\"\r\n\r\nTheir position was a strong one. A cricket captain may seem to be an\r\nautocrat of tremendous power, but in reality he has only one weapon, the\r\nkeenness of those under him. With the majority, of course, the fear of\r\nbeing excluded or ejected from a team is a spur that drives. The\r\nmajority, consequently, are easily handled. But when a cricket captain\r\nruns up against a boy who does not much care whether he plays for the\r\nteam or not, then he finds himself in a difficult position, and, unless\r\nhe is a man of action, practically helpless.\r\n\r\nStone and Robinson felt secure. Taking it all around, they felt that\r\nthey would just as soon play for Lower Borlock as for the school. The\r\nbowling of the opposition would be weaker in the former case, and the\r\nchance of making runs greater. To a certain type of cricketer runs are\r\nruns, wherever and however made.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this was that Adair, turning out with the team next\r\nmorning for fielding practice, found himself two short. Barnes was among\r\nthose present, but of the other two representatives of Outwood's house\r\nthere were no signs.\r\n\r\nBarnes, questioned on the subject, had no information to give, beyond\r\nthe fact that he had not seen them about anywhere. Which was not a great\r\nhelp. Adair proceeded with the fielding practice without further delay.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast that morning he was silent and apparently rapt in thought.\r\nMr. Downing, who sat at the top of the table with Adair on his right,\r\nwas accustomed at the morning meal to blend nourishment of the body with\r\nthat of the mind. As a rule he had ten minutes with the daily paper\r\nbefore the bell rang, and it was his practice to hand on the results of\r\nhis reading to Adair and the other house prefects, who, not having seen\r\nthe paper, usually formed an interested and appreciative audience.\r\nToday, however, though the house prefects expressed varying degrees of\r\nexcitement at the news that Sheppard had made a century against\r\nGloucestershire, and that a butter famine was expected in the United\r\nStates, these world-shaking news items seemed to leave Adair cold. He\r\nchamped his bread and marmalade with an abstracted air.\r\n\r\nHe was wondering what to do in the matter of Stone and Robinson.\r\n\r\nMany captains might have passed the thing over. To take it for granted\r\nthat the missing pair had overslept themselves would have been a safe\r\nand convenient way out of the difficulty. But Adair was not the sort of\r\nperson who seeks for safe and convenient ways out of difficulties. He\r\nnever shirked anything, physical or moral.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to interview the absentees.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after school that an opportunity offered itself. He\r\nwent across to Outwood's and found the two nonstarters in the senior day\r\nroom, engaged in the intellectual pursuit of kicking the wall and\r\nmarking the height of each kick with chalk. Adair's entrance coincided\r\nwith a record effort by Stone, which caused the kicker to overbalance\r\nand stagger backward against the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Stone. \"Hello, Adair!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it. Why weren't you two at fielding practice this\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\nRobinson, who left the lead to Stone in all matters, said nothing. Stone\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't turn up,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I know you didn't. Why not?\"\r\n\r\nStone had rehearsed this scene in his mind, and he spoke with the\r\ncoolness which comes from rehearsal.\r\n\r\n\"We decided not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We came to the conclusion that we hadn't any use for early-morning\r\nfielding.\"\r\n\r\nAdair's manner became ominously calm.\r\n\r\n\"You were rather fed up, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just the word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry it bored you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It didn't. We didn't give it the chance to.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson laughed appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\"What's the joke, Robinson?\" asked Adair.\r\n\r\n\"There's no joke,\" said Robinson, with some haste. \"I was only thinking\r\nof something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you something else to think about soon.\"\r\n\r\nStone intervened.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good making a row about it, Adair. You must see that you can't\r\ndo anything. Of course, you can kick us out of the team, if you like,\r\nbut we don't care if you do. Jackson will get us a game any Wednesday or\r\nSaturday for the village he plays for. So we're all right. And the\r\nschool team aren't such a lot of flyers that you can afford to go\r\nchucking people out of it whenever you want to. See what I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"You and Jackson seem to have fixed it all up between you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do? Kick us out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. I thought you'd see it was no good making a beastly row. We'll\r\nplay for the school all right. There's no earthly need for us to turn\r\nout for fielding practice before breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think there is? You may be right. All the same, you're going\r\nto tomorrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Six sharp. Don't be late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be an ass, Adair. We've told you we aren't going to.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's only your opinion. I think you are. I'll give you till five past\r\nsix, as you seem to like lying in bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can turn out if you feel like it. You won't find me there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll be a disappointment. Nor Robinson?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the junior partner in the firm; but he said it without any\r\ndeep conviction. The atmosphere was growing a great deal too tense for\r\nhis comfort.\r\n\r\n\"You've quite made up your minds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Stone.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said Adair quietly, and knocked him down.\r\n\r\nHe was up again in a moment. Adair had pushed the table back, and was\r\nstanding in the middle of the open space.\r\n\r\n\"You cad,\" said Stone. \"I wasn't ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are now. Shall we go on?\"\r\n\r\nStone dashed in without a word, and for a few moments the two might have\r\nseemed evenly matched to a not too intelligent spectator. But science\r\ntells, even in a confined space. Adair was smaller and lighter than\r\nStone, but he was cooler and quicker, and he knew more about the game.\r\nHis blow was always home a fraction of a second sooner than his\r\nopponent's. At the end of a minute Stone was on the floor again.\r\n\r\nHe got up slowly and stood leaning with one hand on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we say ten past six!\" said Adair. \"I'm not particular to a\r\nminute or two.\"\r\n\r\nStone made no reply.\r\n\r\n\"Will ten past six suit you for fielding practice tomorrow?\" said Adair.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Stone.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. How about you, Robinson?\"\r\n\r\nRobinson had been a petrified spectator of the Captain-Kettle-like\r\nmaneuvers of the cricket captain, and it did not take him long to make\r\nup his mind. He was not altogether a coward. In different circumstances\r\nhe might have put up a respectable show. But it takes a more than\r\nordinarily courageous person to embark on a fight which he knows must\r\nend in his destruction. Robinson knew that he was nothing like a match\r\neven for Stone, and Adair had disposed of Stone in a little over one\r\nminute. It seemed to Robinson that neither pleasure nor profit was\r\nlikely to come from an encounter with Adair.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said hastily, \"I'll turn up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Adair. \"I wonder if either of you chaps could tell me which\r\nis Jackson's study.\"\r\n\r\nStone was dabbing at his mouth with a handkerchief, a task which\r\nprecluded anything in the shape of conversation; so Robinson replied\r\nthat Mike's study was the first you came to on the right of the corridor\r\nat the top of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Adair. \"You don't happen to know if he's in, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"He went up with Smith a quarter of an hour ago. I don't know if he's\r\nstill there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go and see,\" said Adair. \"I should like a word with him if he\r\nisn't busy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\nADAIR HAS A WORD WITH MIKE\r\n\r\n\r\nMike, all unconscious of the stirring proceedings which had been going\r\non below stairs, was peacefully reading a letter he had received that\r\nmorning from Strachan at Wrykyn, in which the successor to the cricket\r\ncaptaincy which should have been Mike's had a good deal to say in a\r\nlugubrious strain. In Mike's absence things had been going badly with\r\nWrykyn. A broken arm, contracted in the course of some rash experiments\r\nwith a day boy's motor bicycle, had deprived the team of the services of\r\nDunstable, the only man who had shown any signs of being able to bowl a\r\nside out. Since this calamity, wrote Strachan, everything had gone\r\nwrong. The M.C.C., led by Mike's brother Reggie, the least of the three\r\nfirst-class cricketing Jacksons, had smashed them by a hundred and fifty\r\nruns. Geddington had wiped them off the face of the earth. The Incogs,\r\nwith a team recruited exclusively from the rabbit hutch--not a\r\nwell-known man on the side except Stacey, a veteran who had been playing\r\nfor the club for nearly half a century--had got home by two wickets. In\r\nfact, it was Strachan's opinion that the Wrykyn team that summer was\r\nabout the most hopeless gang of deadbeats that had ever made exhibition\r\nof itself on the school grounds. The Ripton match, fortunately, was off,\r\nowing to an outbreak of mumps at that shrine of learning and\r\nathletics--the second outbreak of the malady in two terms. Which, said\r\nStrachan, was hard lines on Ripton, but a bit of jolly good luck for\r\nWrykyn, as it had saved them from what would probably have been a record\r\nhammering, Ripton having eight of their last year's team left, including\r\nDixon, the fast bowler, against whom Mike alone of the Wrykyn team had\r\nbeen able to make runs in the previous season. Altogether, Wrykyn had\r\nstruck a bad patch.\r\n\r\nMike mourned over his suffering school. If only he could have been there\r\nto help. It might have made all the difference. In school cricket one\r\ngood batsman, to go in first and knock the bowlers off their length, may\r\ntake a weak team triumphantly through a season. In school cricket the\r\nimportance of a good start for the first wicket is incalculable.\r\n\r\nAs he put Strachan's letter away in his pocket, all his old bitterness\r\nagainst Sedleigh, which had been ebbing during the past few days,\r\nreturned with a rush. He was conscious once more of that feeling of\r\npersonal injury which had made him hate his new school on the first\r\nday of term.\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this point, when his resentment was at its height, that\r\nAdair, the concrete representative of everything Sedleighan, entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThere are moments in life's placid course when there has got to be the\r\nbiggest kind of row. This was one of them.\r\n\r\nPsmith, who was leaning against the mantelpiece, reading the serial\r\nstory in a daily paper which he had abstracted from the senior day room,\r\nmade the intruder free of the study with a dignified wave of the hand,\r\nand went on reading. Mike remained in the deck chair in which he was\r\nsitting, and contented himself with glaring at the newcomer.\r\n\r\nPsmith was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\"If you ask my candid opinion,\" he said, looking up from his paper, \"I\r\nshould say that young Lord Antony Trefusis was in the soup already. I\r\nseem to see the consommé splashing about his ankles. He's had a note\r\ntelling him to be under the oak tree in the Park at midnight. He's just\r\noff there at the end of this installment. I bet Long Jack, the poacher,\r\nis waiting there with a sandbag. Care to see the paper, Comrade Adair?\r\nOr don't you take any interest in contemporary literature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Adair. \"I just wanted to speak to Jackson for a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fate,\" said Psmith, \"has led your footsteps to the right place. This is\r\nComrade Jackson, the Pride of the School, sitting before you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nHe suspected that Adair had come to ask him once again to play for the\r\nschool. The fact that the M.C.C. match was on the following day made\r\nthis a probable solution of the reason for his visit. He could think of\r\nno other errand that was likely to have set the head of Downing's paying\r\nafternoon calls.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you in a minute. It won't take long.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Psmith approvingly, \"is right. Speed is the keynote of the\r\npresent age. Promptitude. Dispatch. This is no time for loitering. We\r\nmust be strenuous. We must hustle. We must Do It Now. We--\"\r\n\r\n\"Buck up,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Adair. \"I've just been talking to Stone and Robinson.\"\r\n\r\n\"An excellent way of passing an idle half hour,\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"We weren't exactly idle,\" said Adair grimly. \"It didn't last long, but\r\nit was pretty lively while it did. Stone chucked it after the\r\nfirst round.\"\r\n\r\nMike got up out of his chair. He could not quite follow what all this\r\nwas about, but there was no mistaking the truculence of Adair's manner.\r\nFor some reason, which might possibly be made clear later, Adair was\r\nlooking for trouble, and Mike in his present mood felt that it would be\r\na privilege to see that he got it.\r\n\r\nPsmith was regarding Adair through his eyeglass with pain and surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" he said, \"you do not mean us to understand that you have been\r\n_brawling_ with Comrade Stone! This is bad hearing. I thought that you\r\nand he were like brothers. Such a bad example for Comrade Robinson, too.\r\nLeave us, Adair. We would brood. 'Oh, go thee, knave, I'll none of\r\nthee.' Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith turned away, and resting his elbows on the mantelpiece, gazed at\r\nhimself mournfully in the looking glass.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not the man I was,\" he sighed, after a prolonged inspection. \"There\r\nare lines on my face, dark circles beneath my eyes. The fierce rush of\r\nlife at Sedleigh is wasting me away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stone and I had a discussion about early-morning fielding practice,\"\r\nsaid Adair, turning to Mike.\r\n\r\nMike said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I thought his fielding wanted working up a bit, so I told him to turn\r\nout at six tomorrow morning. He said he wouldn't, so we argued it out.\r\nHe's going to all right. So is Robinson.\"\r\n\r\nMike remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"So are you,\" said Adair.\r\n\r\n\"I get thinner and thinner,\" said Psmith from the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nMike looked at Adair, and Adair looked at Mike, after the manner of two\r\ndogs before they fly at one another. There was an electric silence in\r\nthe study. Psmith peered with increased earnestness into the glass.\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" said Mike at last. \"What makes you think that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think. I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any special reason for my turning out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to play for the school against the M.C.C. tomorrow, and I\r\nwant you to get some practice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how you got that idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Curious I should have done, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very. You aren't building on it much, are you?\" said Mike politely.\r\n\r\n\"I am, rather,\" replied Adair, with equal courtesy.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"My eyes,\" said Psmith regretfully, \"are a bit close together. However,\"\r\nhe added philosophically, \"it's too late to alter that now.\"\r\n\r\nMike drew a step closer to Adair.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think I shall play against the M.C.C.?\" he asked\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to make you.\"\r\n\r\nMike took another step forward. Adair moved to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Would you care to try now?\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nFor just one second the two drew themselves together preparatory to\r\nbeginning the serious business of the interview, and in that second\r\nPsmith, turning from the glass, stepped between them.\r\n\r\n\"Get out of the light, Smith,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nPsmith waved him back with a deprecating gesture.\r\n\r\n\"My dear young friends,\" he said placidly, \"if you _will_ let your angry\r\npassions rise, against the direct advice of Doctor Watts, I suppose you\r\nmust. But when you propose to claw each other in my study, in the midst\r\nof a hundred fragile and priceless ornaments, I lodge a protest. If you\r\nreally feel that you want to scrap, for goodness' sake do it where\r\nthere's some room. I don't want all the study furniture smashed. I know\r\na bank whereon the wild thyme grows, only a few yards down the road,\r\nwhere you can scrap all night if you want to. How would it be to move on\r\nthere? Any objections? None. Then shift ho! And let's get it over.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\nCLEARING THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nPsmith was one of those people who lend a dignity to everything they\r\ntouch. Under his auspices the most unpromising ventures became somehow\r\nenveloped in an atmosphere of measured stateliness. On the present\r\noccasion, what would have been, without his guiding hand, a mere\r\nunscientific scramble, took on something of the impressive formality of\r\nthe National Sporting Club.\r\n\r\n\"The rounds,\" he said, producing a watch, as they passed through a gate\r\ninto a field a couple of hundred yards from the house gate, \"will be of\r\nthree minutes' duration, with a minute rest in between. A man who is\r\ndown will have ten seconds in which to rise. Are you ready, Comrades\r\nAdair and Jackson? Very well, then. Time.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which, it was a pity that the actual fight did not quite live up\r\nto its referee's introduction. Dramatically, there should have been\r\ncautious sparring for openings and a number of tensely contested rounds,\r\nas if it had been the final of a boxing competition. But school fights,\r\nwhen they do occur--which is only once in a decade nowadays, unless you\r\ncount junior school scuffles--are the outcome of weeks of suppressed bad\r\nblood, and are consequently brief and furious. In a boxing competition,\r\nhowever much one may want to win, one does not dislike one's opponent.\r\nUp to the moment when \"time\" was called, one was probably warmly\r\nattached to him, and at the end of the last round one expects to resume\r\nthat attitude of mind. In a fight each party, as a rule, hates\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nSo it happened that there was nothing formal or cautious about the\r\npresent battle. All Adair wanted was to get at Mike, and all Mike wanted\r\nwas to get at Adair. Directly Psmith called \"time,\" they rushed together\r\nas if they meant to end the thing in half a minute.\r\n\r\nIt was this that saved Mike. In an ordinary contest with the gloves,\r\nwith his opponent cool and boxing in his true form, he could not have\r\nlasted three rounds against Adair. The latter was a clever boxer, while\r\nMike had never had a lesson in his life. If Adair had kept away and used\r\nhis head, nothing could have prevented his winning.\r\n\r\nAs it was, however, he threw away his advantages, much as Tom Brown did\r\nat the beginning of his fight with Slogger Williams, and the result was\r\nthe same as on that historic occasion. Mike had the greater strength,\r\nand, thirty seconds from the start, knocked his man clean off his feet\r\nwith an unscientific but powerful righthander.\r\n\r\nThis finished Adair's chances. He rose full of fight, but with all the\r\nscience knocked out of him. He went in at Mike with both hands. The\r\nIrish blood in him, which for the ordinary events of life made him\r\nmerely energetic and dashing, now rendered him reckless. He abandoned\r\nall attempt at guarding. It was the Frontal Attack in its most futile\r\nform, and as unsuccessful as a frontal attack is apt to be. There was a\r\nswift exchange of blows, in the course of which Mike's left elbow,\r\ncoming into contact with his opponent's right fist, got a shock which\r\nkept it tingling for the rest of the day; and then Adair went down in\r\na heap.\r\n\r\nHe got up slowly and with difficulty. For a moment he stood blinking\r\nvaguely. Then he lurched forward at Mike.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of a fight--which is, after all, about the most\r\nexciting thing that ever happens to one in the course of one's life--it\r\nis difficult for the fighters to see what the spectators see. Where the\r\nspectators see an assault on an already beaten man, the fighter himself\r\nonly sees a legitimate piece of self-defense against an opponent whose\r\nchances are equal to his own. Psmith saw, as anybody looking on would\r\nhave seen, that Adair was done. Mike's blow had taken him within a\r\nfraction of an inch of the point of the jaw, and he was all but knocked\r\nout. Mike could not see this. All he understood was that his man was on\r\nhis feet again and coming at him, so he hit out with all his strength;\r\nand this time Adair went down and stayed down.\r\n\r\n\"Brief,\" said Psmith, coming forward, \"but exciting. We may take that, I\r\nthink, to be the conclusion of the entertainment. I will now have a dash\r\nat picking up the slain. I shouldn't stop, if I were you. He'll be\r\nsitting up and taking notice soon, and if he sees you he may want to go\r\non with the combat, which would do him no earthly good. If it's going to\r\nbe continued in our next, there had better be a bit of an interval for\r\nalterations and repairs first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he hurt much, do you think?\" asked Mike. He had seen knockouts\r\nbefore in the ring, but this was the first time he had ever effected one\r\non his own account, and Adair looked unpleasantly corpselike.\r\n\r\n\"_He's_ all right,\" said Psmith. \"In a minute or two he'll be skipping\r\nabout like a little lambkin. I'll look after him. You go away and\r\npick flowers.\"\r\n\r\nMike put on his coat and walked back to the house. He was conscious of a\r\nperplexing whirl of new and strange emotions, chief among which was a\r\ncurious feeling that he rather liked Adair. He found himself thinking\r\nthat Adair was a good chap, that there was something to be said for his\r\npoint of view, and that it was a pity he had knocked him about so much.\r\nAt the same time, he felt an undeniable thrill of pride at having beaten\r\nhim. The feat presented that interesting person, Mike Jackson, to him in\r\na fresh and pleasing light, as one who had had a tough job to face and\r\nhad carried it through. Jackson the cricketer he knew, but Jackson the\r\ndeliverer of knockout blows was strange to him, and he found this new\r\nacquaintance a man to be respected.\r\n\r\nThe fight, in fact, had the result which most fights have, if they are\r\nfought fairly and until one side has had enough. It revolutionized\r\nMike's view of things. It shook him up, and drained the bad blood out of\r\nhim. Where before he had seemed to himself to be acting with massive\r\ndignity, he now saw that he had simply been sulking like some wretched\r\nkid. There had appeared to him something rather fine in his policy of\r\nrefusing to identify himself in any way with Sedleigh, a touch of the\r\nstone-walls-do-not-a-prison-make sort of thing. He now saw that his\r\nattitude was to be summed up in the words, \"Sha'n't play.\"\r\n\r\nIt came upon Mike with painful clearness that he had been making an ass\r\nof himself.\r\n\r\nHe had come to this conclusion, after much earnest thought, when Psmith\r\nentered the study.\r\n\r\n\"How's Adair?\" asked Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Sitting up and taking nourishment once more. We have been chatting.\r\nHe's not a bad cove.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's all right,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Psmith straightened his tie.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"I seldom interfere in terrestrial strife, but it\r\nseems to me that there's an opening here for a capable peacemaker, not\r\nafraid of work, and willing to give his services in exchange for a\r\ncomfortable home. Comrade Adair's rather a stoutish fellow in his way.\r\nI'm not much on the 'Play up for the old school, Jones,' game, but\r\neveryone to his taste. I shouldn't have thought anybody would get\r\noverwhelmingly attached to this abode of wrath, but Comrade Adair seems\r\nto have done it. He's all for giving Sedleigh a much-needed boost-up.\r\nIt's not a bad idea in its way. I don't see why one shouldn't humor him.\r\nApparently he's been sweating since early childhood to buck the school\r\nup. And as he's leaving at the end of the term, it mightn't be a scaly\r\nscheme to give him a bit of a send-off, if possible, by making the\r\ncricket season a bit of a banger. As a start, why not drop him a line to\r\nsay that you'll play against the M.C.C. tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\nMike did not reply at once. He was feeling better disposed toward Adair\r\nand Sedleigh then he had felt, but he was not sure that he was quite\r\nprepared to go as far as a complete climb-down.\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be a bad idea,\" continued Psmith. \"There's nothing like\r\ngiving in to a man a bit every now and then. It broadens the soul and\r\nimproves the action of the skin. What seems to have fed up Comrade\r\nAdair, to a certain extent, is that Stone apparently led him to\r\nunderstand that you had offered to give him and Robinson places in your\r\nvillage team. You didn't, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Mike indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"I told him he didn't know the old _noblesse oblige_ spirit of the\r\nJacksons. I said that you would scorn to tarnish the Jackson escutcheon\r\nby not playing the game. My eloquence convinced him. However, to return\r\nto the point under discussion, why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't ... What I mean to say ...\" began Mike.\r\n\r\n\"If your trouble is,\" said Psmith, \"that you fear that you may be in\r\nunworthy company--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"--Dismiss it. _I_ am playing.\"\r\n\r\nMike stared.\r\n\r\n\"You're _what? You_?\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said Psmith, breathing on a coat button, and polishing it with his\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Can you play cricket?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have discovered,\" said Psmith, \"my secret sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're rotting.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wrong me, Comrade Jackson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why haven't you played?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you come and play for Lower Borlock, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"The last time I played in a village cricket match I was caught at point\r\nby a man in braces. It would have been madness to risk another such\r\nshock to my system. My nerves are so exquisitely balanced that a thing\r\nof that sort takes years off my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but look here, Smith, bar rotting. Are you really any good at\r\ncricket?\"\r\n\r\n\"Competent judges at Eton gave me to understand so. I was told that this\r\nyear I should be a certainty for Lord's. But when the cricket season\r\ncame, where was I? Gone. Gone like some beautiful flower that withers in\r\nthe night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you told me you didn't like cricket. You said you only liked\r\nwatching it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right. I do. But at schools where cricket is compulsory you have\r\nto overcome your private prejudices. And in time the thing becomes a\r\nhabit. Imagine my feelings when I found that I was degenerating, little\r\nby little, into a slow left-hand bowler with a swerve. I fought against\r\nit, but it was useless, and after a while I gave up the struggle, and\r\ndrifted with the stream. Last year in a house match\"--Psmith's voice\r\ntook on a deeper tone of melancholy--\"I took seven for thirteen in the\r\nsecond innings on a hard wicket. I did think, when I came here, that I\r\nhad found a haven of rest, but it was not to be. I turn out tomorrow.\r\nWhat Comrade Outwood will say, when he finds that his keenest\r\narchaeological disciple has deserted, I hate to think. However ...\"\r\n\r\nMike felt as if a young and powerful earthquake had passed. The whole\r\nface of his world had undergone a quick change. Here was he, the\r\nrecalcitrant, wavering on the point of playing for the school, and here\r\nwas Psmith, the last person whom he would have expected to be a player,\r\nstating calmly that he had been in the running for a place in the\r\nEton eleven.\r\n\r\nThen in a flash Mike understood. He was not by nature intuitive, but he\r\nread Psmith's mind now. Since the term began, he and Psmith had been\r\nacting on precisely similar motives. Just as he had been disappointed of\r\nthe captaincy of cricket at Wrykyn, so had Psmith been disappointed of\r\nhis place in the Eton team at Lord's. And they had both worked it off,\r\neach in his own way--Mike sullenly, Psmith whimsically, according to\r\ntheir respective natures--on Sedleigh.\r\n\r\nIf Psmith, therefore, did not consider it too much of a climb-down to\r\nrenounce his resolution not to play for Sedleigh, there was nothing to\r\nstop Mike doing so, as--at the bottom of his heart--he wanted to do.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove,\" he said, \"if you're playing, I'll play. I'll write a note to\r\nAdair now. But, I say\"--he stopped--\"I'm hanged if I'm going to turn out\r\nand field before breakfast tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right. You won't have to. Adair won't be there himself. He's\r\nnot playing against the M.C.C. He's sprained his wrist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\nIN WHICH PEACE IS DECLARED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sprained his wrist?\" said Mike. \"How did he do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"During the brawl. Apparently one of his efforts got home on your elbow\r\ninstead of your expressive countenance, and whether it was that your\r\nelbow was particularly tough or his wrist particularly fragile, I don't\r\nknow. Anyhow, it went. It's nothing bad, but it'll keep him out of the\r\ngame tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, what beastly rough luck! I'd no idea. I'll go around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bad scheme. Close the door gently after you, and if you see\r\nanybody downstairs who looks as if he were likely to be going over to\r\nthe shop, ask him to get me a small pot of some rare old jam and tell\r\nthe man to chalk it up to me. The jam Comrade Outwood supplies to us at\r\ntea is all right as a practical joke or as a food for those anxious to\r\ncommit suicide, but useless to anybody who values life.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Mr. Downing's and going to Adair's study, Mike found that\r\nhis late antagonist was out. He left a note informing him of his\r\nwillingness to play in the morrow's match. The lock-up bell rang as he\r\nwent out of the house.\r\n\r\nA spot of rain fell on his hand. A moment later there was a continuous\r\npatter, as the storm, which had been gathering all day, broke in\r\nearnest. Mike turned up his coat collar, and ran back to Outwood's. \"At\r\nthis rate,\" he said to himself, \"there won't be a match at all\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the weather decides, after behaving well for some weeks, to show\r\nwhat it can do in another direction, it does the thing thoroughly. When\r\nMike woke the next morning the world was gray and dripping.\r\nLeaden-colored clouds drifted over the sky, till there was not a trace\r\nof blue to be seen, and then the rain began again, in the gentle,\r\ndetermined way rain has when it means to make a day of it.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those bad days when one sits in the pavilion, damp and\r\ndepressed, while figures in mackintoshes, with discolored buckskin\r\nboots, crawl miserably about the field in couples.\r\n\r\nMike, shuffling across to school in a Burberry, met Adair at Downing's\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nThese moments are always difficult. Mike stopped--he could hardly walk\r\non as if nothing had happened--and looked down at his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Coming across?\" he said awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!\" said Adair.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence.\r\n\r\n\"It's only about ten to, isn't it?\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nAdair fished out his watch, and examined it with an elaborate care born\r\nof nervousness.\r\n\r\n\"About nine to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. We've got plenty of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate having to hurry over to school.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"I often do cut it rather fine, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. So do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beastly nuisance when one does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beastly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only about a couple of minutes from the houses to the school, I\r\nshould think, shouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much more. Might be three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Three if one didn't hurry.\"\r\n\r\nAnother silence.\r\n\r\n\"Beastly day,\" said Adair.\r\n\r\n\"Rotten.\"\r\n\r\nSilence again.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Mike, scowling at his toes, \"awfully sorry about your\r\nwrist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right. It was my fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, rather not, thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd no idea you'd crocked yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, that's all right. It was only right at the end. You'd have\r\nsmashed me anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, rot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I bet you anything you like you would.\"\r\n\r\n\"I bet you I shouldn't.... Jolly hard luck, just before the match.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no.... I say, thanks awfully for saying you'd play.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, rot.... Do you think we shall get a game?\"\r\n\r\nAdair inspected the sky carefully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It looks pretty bad, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rotten. I say, how long will your wrist keep you out of cricket?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be all right in a week. Less, probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that you and Smith are going to play, we ought to have a jolly good\r\nseason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rummy, Smith turning out to be a cricketer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I should think he'd be a hot bowler, with his height.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be jolly good if he was only just out of the Eton team last\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the time?\" asked Mike.\r\n\r\nAdair produced his watch once more.\r\n\r\n\"Five to.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've heaps of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, heaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's stroll on a bit down the road, shall we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!\"\r\n\r\nMike cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\"I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been talking to Smith. He was telling me that you thought I'd\r\npromised to give Stone and Robinson places in the--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, that's all right. It was only for a bit. Smith told me you\r\ncouldn't have done, and I saw that I was an ass to think you could have.\r\nIt was Stone seeming so dead certain that he could play for Lower\r\nBorlock if I chucked him from the school team that gave me the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"He never even asked me to get him a place.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I wouldn't have done it, even if he had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to play myself, but I wasn't going to do a rotten trick\r\nlike getting other fellows away from the team.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was rotten enough, really, not playing myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. Beastly rough luck having to leave Wrykyn just when you were\r\ngoing to be captain, and come to a small school like this.\"\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the past few days must have had a stimulating effect\r\non Mike's mind--shaken it up, as it were, for now, for the second time\r\nin two days, he displayed quite a creditable amount of intuition. He\r\nmight have been misled by Adair's apparently deprecatory attitude toward\r\nSedleigh, and blundered into a denunciation of the place. Adair had\r\nsaid, \"a small school like this\" in the sort of voice which might have\r\nled his hearer to think that he was expected to say, \"Yes, rotten little\r\nhole, isn't it?\" or words to that effect. Mike, fortunately, perceived\r\nthat the words were used purely from politeness, on the Chinese\r\nprinciple. When a Chinese man wishes to pay a compliment, he does so by\r\nbelittling himself and his belongings.\r\n\r\nHe eluded the pitfall.\r\n\r\n\"What rot!\" he said. \"Sedleigh's one of the most sporting schools I've\r\never come across. Everybody's as keen as blazes. So they ought to be,\r\nafter the way you've sweated.\"\r\n\r\nAdair shuffled awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\"I've always been fairly keen on the place,\" he said. \"But I don't\r\nsuppose I've done anything much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've loosened one of my front teeth,\" said Mike, with a grin, \"if\r\nthat's any comfort to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't eat anything except porridge this morning. My jaw still\r\naches.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time during the conversation their eyes met, and the\r\nhumorous side of the thing struck them simultaneously. They began\r\nto laugh.\r\n\r\n\"What fools we must have looked,\" said Adair.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ were all right. I must have looked rotten. I've never had the\r\ngloves on in my life. I'm jolly glad no one saw us except Smith, who\r\ndoesn't count. Hello, there's the bell. We'd better be moving on. What\r\nabout this match? Not much chance of it from the look of the sky\r\nat present.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might clear before eleven. You'd better get changed, anyhow, at the\r\ninterval, and hang about in case.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. It's better than doing Thucydides with Downing. We've got\r\nmath till the interval, so I don't see anything of him all day; which\r\nwon't hurt me.\"\r\n\r\n\"He isn't a bad sort of chap, when you get to know him,\" said Adair.\r\n\r\n\"I can't have done, then. I don't know which I'd least soon be, Downing\r\nor a black beetle, except that if one was Downing one could tread on the\r\nblack beetle. Dash this rain. I got about half a pint down my neck just\r\nthen. We shan't get a game today, or anything like it. As you're\r\ncrocked, I'm not sure that I care much. You've been sweating for years\r\nto get the match on, and it would be rather rot playing it without you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that so much. I wish we could play because I'm certain,\r\nwith you and Smith, we'd walk into them. They probably aren't sending\r\ndown much of a team, and really, now that you and Smith are turning out,\r\nwe've got a jolly hot lot. There's quite decent batting all the way\r\nthrough, and the bowling isn't so bad. If only we could have given this\r\nM.C.C. lot a really good hammering, it might have been easier to get\r\nsome good fixtures for next season. You see, it's all right for a school\r\nlike Wrykyn, but with a small place like this you simply can't get the\r\nbest teams to give you a match till you've done something to show that\r\nyou aren't absolute rotters at the game. As for the schools, they're\r\nworse. They'd simply laugh at you. You were cricket secretary at Wrykyn\r\nlast year. What would you have done if you'd had a challenge from\r\nSedleigh? You'd either have laughed till you were sick, or else had a\r\nfit at the mere idea of the thing.\"\r\n\r\nMike stopped.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, you've struck about the brightest scheme on record. I never\r\nthought of it before. Let's get a match on with Wrykyn.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! They wouldn't play us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they would. At least, I'm pretty sure they would. I had a letter\r\nfrom Strachan, the captain, yesterday, saying that the Ripton match had\r\nhad to be scratched owing to illness. So they've got a vacant date.\r\nShall I try them? I'll write to Strachan tonight, if you like. And they\r\naren't strong this year. We'll smash them. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\nAdair was as one who has seen a vision.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove,\" he said at last, \"if we only could!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nMR. DOWNING MOVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain continued without a break all the morning. The two teams, after\r\nhanging about dismally, and whiling the time away with stump-cricket in\r\nthe changing rooms, lunched in the pavilion at one o'clock. After which\r\nthe M.C.C. captain, approaching Adair, moved that this merry meeting be\r\nconsidered off and he and his men permitted to catch the next train back\r\nto town. To which Adair, seeing that it was out of the question that\r\nthere should be any cricket that afternoon, regretfully agreed, and the\r\nfirst Sedleigh _v_. M.C.C. match was accordingly scratched.\r\n\r\nMike and Psmith, wandering back to the house, were met by a damp junior\r\nfrom Downing's, with a message that Mr. Downing wished to see Mike as\r\nsoon as he was changed.\r\n\r\n\"What's he want me for?\" inquired Mike.\r\n\r\nThe messenger did not know. Mr. Downing, it seemed, had not confided in\r\nhim. All he knew was that the housemaster was in the house, and would be\r\nglad if Mike would step across.\r\n\r\n\"A nuisance,\" said Psmith, \"this incessant demand for you. That's the\r\nworst of being popular. If he wants you to stop to tea, edge away. A\r\nmeal on rather a sumptuous scale will be prepared in the study against\r\nyour return.\"\r\n\r\nMike changed quickly, and went off, leaving Psmith, who was fond of\r\nsimple pleasures in his spare time, earnestly occupied with a puzzle\r\nwhich had been scattered through the land by a weekly paper. The prize\r\nfor a solution was one thousand pounds, and Psmith had already informed\r\nMike with some minuteness of his plans for the disposition of this sum.\r\nMeanwhile, he worked at it both in and out of school, generally with\r\nabusive comments on its inventor.\r\n\r\nHe was still fiddling away at it when Mike returned.\r\n\r\nMike, though Psmith was at first too absorbed to notice it, was\r\nagitated.\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to be in any way harsh,\" said Psmith, without looking up,\r\n\"but the man who invented this thing was a blighter of the worst type.\r\nYou come and have a shot. For the moment I am baffled. The whisper flies\r\nround the clubs, 'Psmith is baffled.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The man's an absolute driveling ass,\" said Mike warmly.\r\n\r\n\"Me, do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth would be the point of my doing it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd gather in a thousand of the best. Give you a nice start in life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not talking about your rotten puzzle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _are_ you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"That ass Downing. I believe he's off his nut.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your chat with Comrade Downing was not of the\r\nold-College-chums-meeting-unexpectedly-after-years'-separation type?\r\nWhat has he been doing to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's off his nut.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. But what did he do? How did the brainstorm burst? Did he jump\r\nat you from behind a door and bite a piece out of your leg, or did he\r\nsay he was a teapot?\"\r\n\r\nMike sat down.\r\n\r\n\"You remember that painting-Sammy business?\"\r\n\r\n\"As if it were yesterday,\" said Psmith. \"Which it was, pretty nearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"He thinks I did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Have you ever shown any talent in the painting line?\"\r\n\r\n\"The silly ass wanted me to confess that I'd done it. He as good as\r\nasked me to. Jawed a lot of rot about my finding it to my advantage\r\nlater on if I behaved sensibly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what are you worrying about? Don't you know that when a master\r\nwants you to do the confessing act, it simply means that he hasn't\r\nenough evidence to start in on you with? You're all right. The thing's a\r\nstand-off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Evidence!\" said Mike. \"My dear man, he's got enough evidence to sink a\r\nship. He's absolutely sweating evidence at every pore. As far as I can\r\nsee, he's been crawling about, doing the Sherlock Holmes business for\r\nall he's worth ever since the thing happened, and now he's dead certain\r\nthat I painted Sammy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Did_ you, by the way?\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mike shortly, \"I didn't. But after listening to Downing I\r\nalmost began to wonder if I hadn't. The man's got stacks of evidence to\r\nprove that I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as what?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's mostly about my shoes. But, dash it, you know all about that. Why,\r\nyou were with him when he came and looked for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Psmith, \"that Comrade Downing and I spent a very\r\npleasant half hour together inspecting shoes, but how does he drag\r\nyou into it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He swears one of the shoes was splashed with paint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He babbled to some extent on that point when I was entertaining\r\nhim. But what makes him think that the shoe, if any, was yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's certain that somebody in this house got one of his shoes splashed,\r\nand is hiding it somewhere. And I'm the only chap in the house who\r\nhasn't got a pair of shoes to show, so he thinks it's me. I don't know\r\nwhere the dickens my other shoe has gone. Of course I've got two pairs,\r\nbut one's being soled. So I had to go over to school yesterday in gym\r\nshoes. That's how he spotted me.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Comrade Jackson,\" he said mournfully, \"all this very sad affair shows\r\nthe folly of acting from the best motives. In my simple zeal, meaning to\r\nsave you unpleasantness, I have landed you, with a dull, sickening thud,\r\nright in the cart. Are you particular about dirtying your hands? If you\r\naren't, just reach up that chimney a bit!\"\r\n\r\nMike stared.\r\n\r\n\"What the dickens are you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on. Get it over. Be a man, and reach up the chimney.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what the game is,\" said Mike, kneeling beside the fender\r\nand groping, \"but--_Hello_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah ha!\" said Psmith moodily.\r\n\r\nMike dropped the soot-covered object in the fender, and glared at it.\r\n\r\n\"It's my shoe!\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_,\" said Psmith, \"your shoe. And what is that red stain across\r\nthe toe? Is it blood? No, 'tis not blood. It is red paint.\"\r\n\r\nMike seemed unable to remove his eyes from the shoe.\r\n\r\n\"How on earth did--By Jove! I remember now. I kicked up against\r\nsomething in the dark when I was putting my bicycle back that night. It\r\nmust have been the paint pot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you were out that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather. That's what makes it so jolly awkward. It's too long to tell\r\nyou now--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your stories are never too long for me,\" said Psmith. \"Say on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was like this.\" And Mike related the events which had led up\r\nto his midnight excursion. Psmith listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" he said, when Mike had finished, \"confirms my frequently stated\r\nopinion that Comrade Jellicoe is one of Nature's blitherers. So that's\r\nwhy he touched us for our hard-earned, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Of course there was no need for him to have the money at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the result is that you are in something of a tight place. You're\r\n_absolutely_ certain you didn't paint that dog? Didn't do it, by any\r\nchance, in a moment of absent-mindedness, and forgot all about it? No?\r\nNo, I suppose not. I wonder who did!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's beastly awkward. You see, Downing chased me that night. That was\r\nwhy I rang the alarm bell. So, you see, he's certain to think that the\r\nchap he chased, which was me, and the chap who painted Sammy, are the\r\nsame. I shall get landed both ways.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith pondered.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ a tightish place,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if we could get this shoe clean,\" said Mike, inspecting it\r\nwith disfavor.\r\n\r\n\"Not for a pretty considerable time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose not. I say, I _am_ in the cart. If I can't produce this shoe,\r\nthey're bound to guess why.\"\r\n\r\n\"What exactly,\" asked Psmith, \"was the position of affairs between you\r\nand Comrade Downing when you left him? Had you definitely parted brass\r\nrags? Or did you simply sort of drift apart with mutual courtesies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he said I was ill advised to continue that attitude, or some rot,\r\nand I said I didn't care, I hadn't painted his bally dog, and he said\r\nvery well, then, he must take steps, and--well, that was about all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sufficient, too,\" said Psmith, \"quite sufficient, I take it, then, that\r\nhe is now on the warpath, collecting a gang, so to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he's gone to the Old Man about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably. A very worrying time our headmaster is having, taking it all\r\nround, in connection with this painful affair. What do you think his\r\nmove will be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he'll send for me, and try to get something out of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_He'll_ want you to confess, too. Masters are all whales on confession.\r\nThe worst of it is, you can't prove an alibi, because at about the time\r\nthe foul act was perpetrated, you were playing Round-and-round-the-\r\nmulberry-bush with Comrade Downing. This needs thought. You had\r\nbetter put the case in my hands, and go out and watch the dandelions\r\ngrowing. I will think over the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope you'll be able to think of something. I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly. You never know.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a tap at the door.\r\n\r\n\"See how we have trained them,\" said Psmith. \"They now knock before\r\nentering. There was a time when they would have tried to smash in a\r\npanel. Come in.\"\r\n\r\nA small boy, carrying a straw hat adorned with the School House ribbon,\r\nanswered the invitation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say, Jackson,\" he said, \"the headmaster sent me over to tell you\r\nhe wants to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you so,\" said Mike to Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go,\" suggested Psmith. \"Tell him to write.\"\r\n\r\nMike got up.\r\n\r\n\"All this is very trying,\" said Psmith. \"I'm seeing nothing of you\r\ntoday.\" He turned to the small boy. \"Tell Willie,\" he added, \"that Mr.\r\nJackson will be with him in a moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe emissary departed.\r\n\r\n\"_You're_ all right,\" said Psmith encouragingly. \"Just you keep on\r\nsaying you're all right. Stout denial is the thing. Don't go in for any\r\nairy explanations. Simply stick to stout denial. You can't beat it.\"\r\n\r\nWith which expert advice, he allowed Mike to go on his way.\r\n\r\nHe had not been gone two minutes, when Psmith, who had leaned back in\r\nhis chair, rapt in thought, heaved himself up again. He stood for a\r\nmoment straightening his tie at the looking glass; then he picked up his\r\nhat and moved slowly out of the door and down the passage. Thence, at\r\nthe same dignified rate of progress, out of the house and in at\r\nDowning's front gate.\r\n\r\nThe postman was at the door when he got there, apparently absorbed in\r\nconversation with the parlor maid. Psmith stood by politely till the\r\npostman, who had just been told it was like his impudence, caught sight\r\nof him, and, having handed over the letters in an ultraformal and\r\nprofessional manner, passed away.\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Downing at home?\" inquired Psmith.\r\n\r\nHe was, it seemed. Psmith was shown into the dining room on the left of\r\nthe hall, and requested to wait. He was examining a portrait of Mr.\r\nDowning which hung on the wall when the housemaster came in.\r\n\r\n\"An excellent likeness, sir,\" said Psmith, with a gesture of the hand\r\ntoward the painting.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Smith,\" said Mr. Downing shortly, \"what do you wish to see me\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was in connection with the regrettable painting of your dog, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"I did it, sir,\" said Psmith, stopping and flicking a piece of fluff off\r\nhis knee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\nTHE ARTIST CLAIMS HIS WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe line of action which Psmith had called Stout Denial is an excellent\r\nline to adopt, especially if you really are innocent, but it does not\r\nlead to anything in the shape of a bright and snappy dialogue between\r\naccuser and accused. Both Mike and the headmaster were oppressed by a\r\nfeeling that the situation was difficult. The atmosphere was heavy, and\r\nconversation showed a tendency to flag. The headmaster had opened\r\nbrightly enough, with a summary of the evidence which Mr. Downing had\r\nlaid before him, but after that a massive silence had been the order of\r\nthe day. There is nothing in this world quite so stolid and\r\nuncommunicative as a boy who has made up his mind to be stolid and\r\nuncommunicative; and the headmaster, as he sat and looked at Mike, who\r\nsat and looked past him at the bookshelves, felt awkward. It was a scene\r\nwhich needed either a dramatic interruption or a neat exit speech. As it\r\nhappened, what it got was the dramatic interruption.\r\n\r\nThe headmaster was just saying, \"I do not think you fully realize,\r\nJackson, the extent to which appearances ...\"--which was practically\r\ngoing back to the beginning and starting again--when there was a knock\r\nat the door. A voice without said, \"Mr. Downing to see you, sir,\" and\r\nthe chief witness for the prosecution burst in.\r\n\r\n\"I would not have interrupted you,\" said Mr. Downing, \"but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Mr. Downing. Is there anything I can ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I have discovered ... I have been informed ... In short, it was not\r\nJackson, who committed the--who painted my dog.\"\r\n\r\nMike and the headmaster both looked at the speaker. Mike with a feeling\r\nof relief--for Stout Denial, unsupported by any weighty evidence, is a\r\nwearing game to play--the headmaster with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Not Jackson?\" said the headmaster.\r\n\r\n\"No. It was a boy in the same house. Smith.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith! Mike was more than surprised. He could not believe it. There is\r\nnothing which affords so clear an index to a boy's character as the type\r\nof rag which he considers humorous. Between what is a rag and what is\r\nmerely a rotten trick there is a very definite line drawn. Masters, as a\r\nrule, do not realize this, but boys nearly always do. Mike could not\r\nimagine Psmith doing a rotten thing like covering a housemaster's dog\r\nwith red paint, any more than he could imagine doing it himself. They\r\nhad both been amused at the sight of Sammy after the operation, but\r\nanybody, except possibly the owner of the dog, would have thought it\r\nfunny at first. After the first surprise, their feeling had been that it\r\nwas a rotten thing to have done and beastly rough luck on the poor\r\nbrute. It was a kid's trick. As for Psmith having done it, Mike simply\r\ndid not believe it.\r\n\r\n\"Smith!\" said the headmaster. \"What makes you think that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply this,\" said Mr. Downing, with calm triumph, \"that the boy\r\nhimself came to me a few moments ago and confessed.\"\r\n\r\nMike was conscious of a feeling of acute depression. It did not make him\r\nin the least degree jubilant, or even thankful, to know that he himself\r\nwas cleared of the charge. All he could think of was that Psmith was\r\ndone for. This was bound to mean the sack. If Psmith had painted Sammy\r\nit meant that Psmith had broken out of his house at night; and it was\r\nnot likely that the rules about nocturnal wandering were less strict at\r\nSedleigh than at any other school in the kingdom. Mike felt, if\r\npossible, worse than he had felt when Wyatt had been caught on a similar\r\noccasion. It seemed as if Fate had a special grudge against his best\r\nfriends. He did not make friends very quickly or easily, though he had\r\nalways had scores of acquaintances--and with Wyatt and Psmith he had\r\nfound himself at home from the first moment he had met them.\r\n\r\nHe sat there, with a curious feeling of having swallowed a heavy weight,\r\nhardly listening to what Mr. Downing was saying. Mr. Downing was talking\r\nrapidly to the headmaster, who was nodding from time to time.\r\n\r\nMike took advantage of a pause to get up. \"May I go, sir?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Jackson, certainly,\" said the Head. \"Oh, and er--if you are\r\ngoing back to your house, tell Smith that I should like to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe had reached the door, when again there was a knock.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" said the headmaster.\r\n\r\nIt was Adair.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Adair?\"\r\n\r\nAdair was breathing rather heavily, as if he had been running.\r\n\r\n\"It was about Sammy--Sampson, sir,\" he said, looking at Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, we know ... Well, Adair, what did you wish to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't Jackson who did it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Adair. So Mr. Downing--\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Dunster, sir.\"\r\n\r\nTerrific sensation! The headmaster gave a sort of strangled yelp of\r\nastonishment. Mr. Downing leaped in his chair. Mike's eyes opened to\r\ntheir fullest extent.\r\n\r\n\"Adair!\"\r\n\r\nThere was almost a wail in the headmaster's voice. The situation had\r\nsuddenly become too much for him. His brain was swimming. That Mike,\r\ndespite the evidence against him, should be innocent, was curious,\r\nperhaps, but not particularly startling. But that Adair should inform\r\nhim, two minutes after Mr. Downing's announcement of Psmith's\r\nconfession, that Psmith, too, was guiltless, and that the real criminal\r\nwas Dunster--it was this that made him feel that somebody, in the words\r\nof an American author, had played a mean trick on him, and substituted\r\nfor his brain a side order of cauliflower. Why Dunster, of all people?\r\nDunster, who, he remembered dizzily, had left the school at Christmas.\r\nAnd why, if Dunster had really painted the dog, had Psmith asserted that\r\nhe himself was the culprit? Why--why anything? He concentrated his mind\r\non Adair as the only person who could save him from impending\r\nbrain fever.\r\n\r\n\"Adair!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What--_what_ do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It _was_ Dunster, sir. I got a letter from him only five minutes ago,\r\nin which he said that he had painted Sammy--Sampson, the dog, sir, for a\r\nrag--for a joke, and that, as he didn't want anyone here to get into a\r\nrow--be punished for it, I'd better tell Mr. Downing at once. I tried to\r\nfind Mr. Downing, but he wasn't in the house. Then I met Smith outside\r\nthe house, and he told me that Mr. Downing had gone over to see\r\nyou, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smith told you?\" said Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you say anything to him about your having received this letter from\r\nDunster?\"\r\n\r\n\"I gave him the letter to read, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was his attitude when he had read it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He laughed, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Laughed_!\" Mr. Downing's voice was thunderous.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. He rolled about.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Downing snorted.\r\n\r\n\"But Adair,\" said the headmaster, \"I do not understand how this thing\r\ncould have been done by Dunster. He has left the school.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was down here for the Old Sedleighans' match, sir. He stopped the\r\nnight in the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that was the night the--it happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. Well, I am glad to find that the blame can not be attached to\r\nany boy in the school. I am sorry that it is even an Old Boy. It was a\r\nfoolish, discreditable thing to have done, but it is not as bad as if\r\nany boy still at the school had broken out of his house at night to\r\ndo it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sergeant,\" said Mr. Downing, \"told me that the boy he saw was\r\nattempting to enter Mr. Outwood's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another freak of Dunster's, I suppose,\" said the headmaster. \"I shall\r\nwrite to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it was really Dunster who painted my dog,\" said Mr. Downing, \"I\r\ncannot understand the part played by Smith in this affair. If he did not\r\ndo it, what possible motive could he have had for coming to me of his\r\nown accord and deliberately confessing?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said the headmaster, pressing a bell. \"It is certainly a\r\nthing that calls for explanation. Barlow,\" he said, as the butler\r\nappeared, \"kindly go across to Mr. Outwood's house and inform Smith that\r\nI should like to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, Mr. Smith is waiting in the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the hall!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. He arrived soon after Mr. Adair, sir, saying that he would\r\nwait, as you would probably wish to see him shortly.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm. Ask him to step up, Barlow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThere followed one of the tensest \"stage waits\" of Mike's experience. It\r\nwas not long, but, while it lasted, the silence was quite solid. Nobody\r\nseemed to have anything to say, and there was not even a clock in the\r\nroom to break the stillness with its ticking. A very faint drip-drip of\r\nrain could be heard outside the window.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs. The door was\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smith, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe Old Etonian entered as would the guest of the evening who is a few\r\nmoments late for dinner. He was cheerful, but slightly deprecating. He\r\ngave the impression of one who, though sure of his welcome, feels that\r\nsome slight apology is expected from him. He advanced into the room with\r\na gentle half-smile which suggested good will to all men.\r\n\r\n\"It is still raining,\" he observed. \"You wished to see me, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped into a deep armchair (which both Adair and Mike had avoided\r\nin favor of less luxurious seats) with the confidential cosiness of a\r\nfashionable physician calling on a patient, between whom and himself\r\ntime has broken down the barriers of restraint and formality.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing burst out, like a reservoir that has broken its banks.\r\n\r\n\"Smith.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith turned his gaze politely in the housemaster's direction.\r\n\r\n\"Smith, you came to me a quarter of an hour ago and told me that it was\r\nyou who had painted my dog Sampson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was absolutely untrue?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid so, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Smith ...\" began the headmaster.\r\n\r\nPsmith bent forward encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"... This is a most extraordinary affair. Have you no explanation to\r\noffer? What induced you to do such a thing?\"\r\n\r\nPsmith sighed softly.\r\n\r\n\"The craze of notoriety, sir,\" he replied sadly. \"The curse of the\r\npresent age.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" replied the headmaster.\r\n\r\n\"It is remarkable,\" proceeded Psmith placidly, with the impersonal touch\r\nof one lecturing on generalities, \"how frequently, when a murder has\r\nbeen committed, one finds men confessing that they have done it when it\r\nis out of the question that they should have committed it. It is one of\r\nthe most interesting problems with which anthropologists are confronted.\r\nHuman nature--\"\r\n\r\nThe headmaster interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Smith,\" he said, \"I should like to see you alone for a moment. Mr.\r\nDowning, might I trouble...? Adair, Jackson.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a motion toward the door.\r\n\r\nWhen he and Psmith were alone, there was silence. Psmith leaned back\r\ncomfortably in his chair. The headmaster tapped nervously with his foot\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Er ... Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\nThe headmaster seemed to have some difficulty in proceeding. He paused\r\nagain. Then he went on.\r\n\r\n\"Er ... Smith, I do not for a moment wish to pain you, but have you ...\r\ner, do you remember ever having had, as a child, let us say, any ...\r\ner ... severe illness? Any ... er ... _mental_ illness?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no--forgive me if I am touching on a sad subject--there is\r\nno ... none of your near relatives have ever suffered in the way I ...\r\ner ... have described?\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't a lunatic on the list, sir,\" said Psmith cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Smith, of course,\" said the headmaster hurriedly, \"I did not\r\nmean to suggest--quite so, quite so. ... You think, then, that you\r\nconfessed to an act which you had not committed purely from some sudden\r\nimpulse which you cannot explain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strictly between ourselves, sir ...\"\r\n\r\nPrivately, the headmaster found Psmith's man-to-man attitude somewhat\r\ndisconcerting, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not like it to go any further, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will certainly respect any confidence ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want anybody to know, sir. This is strictly between ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are sometimes apt to forget, Smith, the proper relations\r\nexisting between boy and--Well, never mind that for the present. We can\r\nreturn to it later. For the moment, let me hear what you wish to say. I\r\nshall, of course, tell nobody, if you do not wish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was like this, sir,\" said Psmith, \"Jackson happened to tell me\r\nthat you and Mr. Downing seemed to think he had painted Mr. Downing's\r\ndog, and there seemed some danger of his being expelled, so I thought it\r\nwouldn't be an unsound scheme if I were to go and say I had done it.\r\nThat was the whole thing. Of course, Dunster writing created a certain\r\namount of confusion.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"It was a very wrong thing to do, Smith,\" said the headmaster, at last,\r\n\"but.... You are a curious boy, Smith. Good night.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, sir,\" said Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bad old sort,\" said Psmith meditatively to himself, as he walked\r\ndownstairs. \"By no means a bad old sort. I must drop in from time to\r\ntime and cultivate him.\"\r\n\r\nMike and Adair were waiting for him outside the front door.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ the limit,\" said Adair. \"What's he done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. We had a very pleasant chat, and then I tore myself away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say he's not going to do a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're a marvel,\" said Adair.\r\n\r\nPsmith thanked him courteously. They walked on toward the houses.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Adair,\" said Mike, as the latter started to turn in at\r\nDowning's, \"I'll write to Strachan tonight about that match.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Psmith.\r\n\r\n\"Jackson's going to try and get Wrykyn to give us a game,\" said Adair.\r\n\"They've got a vacant date. I hope the dickens they'll do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I should think they're certain to,\" said Mike. \"Good night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And give Comrade Downing, when you see him,\" said Psmith, \"my very best\r\nlove. It is men like him who make this Merrie England of ours what\r\nit is.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I say, Psmith,\" said Mike suddenly, \"what really made you tell Downing\r\nyou'd done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The craving for--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, chuck it. You aren't talking to the Old Man now. I believe it was\r\nsimply to get me out of a jolly tight corner.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith's expression was one of pain.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Comrade Jackson,\" said he, \"you wrong me. You make me writhe.\r\nI'm surprised at you. I never thought to hear those words from\r\nMichael Jackson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe you did, all the same,\" said Mike obstinately. \"And it\r\nwas jolly good of you, too.\"\r\n\r\nPsmith moaned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\nSEDLEIGH V. WRYKYN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wrykyn match was three parts over, and things were going badly for\r\nSedleigh. In a way one might have said that the game was over, and that\r\nSedleigh had lost; for it was a one-day match, and Wrykyn, who had led\r\non the first innings, had only to play out time to make the game theirs.\r\n\r\nSedleigh were paying the penalty for allowing themselves to be\r\ninfluenced by nerves in the early part of the day. Nerves lose more\r\nschool matches than good play ever won. There is a certain type of\r\nschool batsman who is a gift to any bowler when he once lets his\r\nimagination run away with him. Sedleigh, with the exception of Adair,\r\nPsmith, and Mike, had entered upon this match in a state of the most\r\nazure funk. Ever since Mike had received Strachan's answer and Adair had\r\nannounced on the notice board that on Saturday, July the twentieth,\r\nSedleigh would play Wrykyn, the team had been all on the jump. It was\r\nuseless for Adair to tell them, as he did repeatedly, on Mike's\r\nauthority, that Wrykyn were weak this season, and that on their present\r\nform Sedleigh ought to win easily. The team listened, but were not\r\ncomforted. Wrykyn might be below their usual strength, but then Wrykyn\r\ncricket, as a rule, reached such a high standard that this probably\r\nmeant little. However weak Wrykyn might be--for them--there was a very\r\nfirm impression among the members of the Sedleigh first eleven that the\r\nother school was quite strong enough to knock the cover off _them_.\r\nExperience counts enormously in school matches. Sedleigh had never been\r\nproved. The teams they played were the sort of sides which the Wrykyn\r\nsecond eleven would play. Whereas Wrykyn, from time immemorial, had been\r\nbeating Ripton teams and Free Foresters teams and M.C.C. teams packed\r\nwith county men and sending men to Oxford and Cambridge who got their\r\nblues as freshmen.\r\n\r\nSedleigh had gone onto the field that morning a depressed side.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate that Adair had won the toss. He had had no choice but\r\nto take first innings. The weather had been bad for the last week, and\r\nthe wicket was slow and treacherous. It was likely to get worse during\r\nthe day, so Adair had chosen to bat first.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the state of nerves the team was in, this in\r\nitself was a calamity. A school eleven are always at their worst and\r\nnerviest before lunch. Even on their own ground they find the\r\nsurroundings lonely and unfamiliar. The subtlety of the bowlers becomes\r\nmagnified. Unless the first pair make a really good start, a collapse\r\nalmost invariably ensues.\r\n\r\nToday the start had been gruesome beyond words. Mike, the bulwark of the\r\nside, the man who had been brought up on Wrykyn bowling, and from whom,\r\nwhatever might happen to the others, at least a fifty was\r\nexpected--Mike, going in first with Barnes and taking first over, had\r\nplayed inside one from Bruce, the Wrykyn slow bowler, and had been\r\ncaught at short slip off his second ball.\r\n\r\nThat put the finishing touch on the panic. Stone, Robinson, and the\r\nothers, all quite decent punishing batsmen when their nerves allowed\r\nthem to play their own game, crawled to the wickets, declined to hit out\r\nat anything, and were clean bowled, several of them, playing back to\r\nhalf volleys. Adair did not suffer from panic, but his batting was not\r\nequal to his bowling, and he had fallen after hitting one four. Seven\r\nwickets were down for thirty when Psmith went in.\r\n\r\nPsmith had always disclaimed any pretensions to batting skill, but he\r\nwas undoubtedly the right man for a crisis like this. He had an enormous\r\nreach, and he used it. Three consecutive balls from Bruce he turned into\r\nfull tosses and swept to the leg boundary, and, assisted by Barnes, who\r\nhad been sitting on the splice in his usual manner, he raised the total\r\nto seventy-one before being yorked, with his score at thirty-five. Ten\r\nminutes later the innings was over, with Barnes not out sixteen, for\r\nseventy-nine.\r\n\r\nWrykyn had then gone in, lost Strachan for twenty before lunch, and\r\nfinally completed their innings at a quarter to four for a hundred and\r\nthirty-one.\r\n\r\nThis was better than Sedleigh had expected. At least eight of the team\r\nhad looked forward dismally to an afternoon's leather hunting. But Adair\r\nand Psmith, helped by the wicket, had never been easy, especially\r\nPsmith, who had taken six wickets, his slows playing havoc with\r\nthe tail.\r\n\r\nIt would be too much to say that Sedleigh had any hope of pulling the\r\ngame out of the fire; but it was a comfort, they felt, at any rate,\r\nhaving another knock. As is usual at this stage of a match, their\r\nnervousness had vanished, and they felt capable of better things than in\r\nthe first innings.\r\n\r\nIt was on Mike's suggestion that Psmith and he went in first. Mike knew\r\nthe limitations of the Wrykyn bowling, and he was convinced that, if\r\nthey could knock Bruce off, it might be possible to rattle up a score\r\nsufficient to give them the game, always provided Wrykyn collapsed in\r\nthe second innings. And it seemed to Mike that the wicket would be so\r\nbad then that they easily might.\r\n\r\nSo he and Psmith had gone in at four o'clock to hit. And they had hit.\r\nThe deficit had been wiped off, all but a dozen runs, when Psmith was\r\nbowled, and by that time Mike was set and in his best vein. He treated\r\nall the bowlers alike. And when Stone came in, restored to his proper\r\nframe of mind, and lashed out stoutly, and after him Robinson and the\r\nrest, it looked as if Sedleigh had a chance again. The score was a\r\nhundred and twenty when Mike, who had just reached his fifty, skied one\r\nto Strachan at cover. The time was twenty-five past five.\r\n\r\nAs Mike reached the pavilion, Adair declared the innings closed.\r\n\r\nWrykyn started batting at twenty-five minutes to six, with sixty-nine to\r\nmake if they wished to make them, and an hour and ten minutes during\r\nwhich to keep up their wickets if they preferred to take things easy and\r\ngo for a win on the first innings.\r\n\r\nAt first it looked as if they meant to knock off the runs, for Strachan\r\nforced the game from the first ball, which was Psmith's, and which he\r\nhit into the pavilion. But, at fifteen, Adair bowled him. And when, two\r\nruns later, Psmith got the next man stumped, and finished up his over\r\nwith a c-and-b, Wrykyn decided that it was not good enough. Seventeen\r\nfor three, with an hour all but five minutes to go, was getting too\r\ndangerous. So Drummond and Rigby, the next pair, proceeded to play with\r\ncaution, and the collapse ceased.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of the game at the point at which this chapter\r\nopened. Seventeen for three had become twenty-four for three, and the\r\nhands of the clock stood at ten minutes past six. Changes of bowling had\r\nbeen tried, but there seemed no chance of getting past the batsmen's\r\ndefence. They were playing all the good balls, and refused to hit at\r\nthe bad.\r\n\r\nA quarter past six struck, and then Psmith made a suggestion which\r\naltered the game completely.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you have a shot this end?\" he said to Adair, as they were\r\ncrossing over. \"There's a spot on the off which might help you a lot.\r\nYou can break like blazes if only you land on it. It doesn't help my leg\r\nbreaks a bit, because they won't hit at them.\"\r\n\r\nBarnes was on the point of beginning to bowl when Adair took the ball\r\nfrom him. The captain of Outwood's retired to short leg with an air that\r\nsuggested that he was glad to be relieved of his prominent post. The\r\nnext moment Drummond's off stump was lying at an angle of forty-five.\r\nAdair was absolutely accurate as a bowler, and he had dropped his first\r\nball right on the worn patch.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Drummond's successor was retiring to the pavilion,\r\nwhile the wicket keeper straightened the stumps again.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like a couple of unexpected wickets for altering the\r\natmosphere of a game. Five minutes before, Sedleigh had been lethargic\r\nand without hope. Now there was a stir and buzz all around the ground.\r\nThere were twenty-five minutes to go, and five wickets were down.\r\nSedleigh was on top again.\r\n\r\nThe next man seemed to take an age coming out. As a matter of fact, he\r\nwalked more rapidly than a batsman usually walks to the crease.\r\n\r\nAdair's third ball dropped just short of the spot. The batsman, hitting\r\nout, was a shade too soon. The ball hummed through the air a couple of\r\nfeet from the ground in the direction of mid off, and Mike, diving to\r\nthe right, got to it as he was falling, and chucked it up.\r\n\r\nAfter that the thing was a walk over. Psmith clean bowled a man in his\r\nnext over: and the tail, demoralized by the sudden change in the game,\r\ncollapsed uncompromisingly. Sedleigh won by thirty-five runs with eight\r\nminutes in hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPsmith and Mike sat in their study after lockup, discussing things in\r\ngeneral and the game in particular. \"I feel like a beastly renegade,\r\nplaying against Wrykyn,\" said Mike. \"Still, I'm glad we won. Adair's a\r\njolly good sort and it'll make him happy for weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I last saw Comrade Adair,\" said Psmith, \"he was going about in a\r\nsort of trance, beaming vaguely and wanting to stand people things at\r\nthe shop.\"\r\n\r\n\"He bowled awfully well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Psmith. \"I say, I don't wish to cast a gloom over this\r\njoyful occasion in any way, but you say Wrykyn are going to give\r\nSedleigh a fixture again next year?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you thought of the massacre which will ensue? You will have\r\nleft, Adair will have left. Incidentally, I shall have left. Wrykyn will\r\nswamp them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they will. Still, the great thing, you see, is to get the\r\nthing started. That's what Adair was so keen on. Now Sedleigh has beaten\r\nWrykyn, he's satisfied. They can get fixtures with decent clubs, and\r\nwork up to playing the big schools. You've got to start somehow. So it's\r\nall right, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, besides,\" said Psmith, reflectively, \"in an emergency they can\r\nalways get Comrade Downing to bowl for them, what? Let us now sally out\r\nand see if we can't promote a rag of some sort in this abode of wrath.\r\nComrade Outwood has gone over to dinner at the School House, and it\r\nwould be a pity to waste a somewhat golden opportunity. Shall\r\nwe stagger?\"\r\n\r\nThey staggered."
