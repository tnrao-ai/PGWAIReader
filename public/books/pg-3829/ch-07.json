    "THE ENTENTE CORDIALE IS SEALED\r\n\r\nThere are moments and moments. The present one belonged to the more\r\npainful variety.\r\n\r\nEven to my exhausted mind it was plain that there was a need here for\r\nexplanations. An Irishman's croquet-lawn is his castle, and strangers\r\ncannot plunge in through hedges without inviting comment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, speech was beyond me. I could have emptied a water-butt,\r\nlaid down and gone to sleep, or melted ice with a touch of the finger,\r\nbut I could not speak. The conversation was opened by the other man, in\r\nwhose restraining hand Aunt Elizabeth now lay, outwardly resigned but\r\ninwardly, as I, who knew her haughty spirit, could guess, boiling with\r\nbaffled resentment. I could see her looking out of the corner of her\r\neye, trying to estimate the chances of getting in one good hard peck\r\nwith her aquiline beak.\r\n\r\n\"Come right in,\" said the man pleasantly. \"Don't knock.\"\r\n\r\nI stood there, gasping. I was only too well aware that I presented a\r\nquaint appearance. I had removed my hat before entering the hedge, and\r\nmy hair was full of twigs and other foreign substances. My face was\r\nmoist and grimy. My mouth hung open. My legs felt as if they had ceased\r\nto belong to me.\r\n\r\n\"I must apol-- ...\" I began, and ended the sentence with gulps.\r\n\r\nThe elderly gentleman looked at me with what seemed to be indignant\r\nsurprise. His daughter appeared to my guilty conscience to be looking\r\nthrough me. Aunt Elizabeth sneered. The only friendly face was the\r\nman's. He regarded me with a kindly smile, as if I were some old friend\r\nwho had dropped in unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\"Take a long breath,\" he advised.\r\n\r\nI took several, and felt better.\r\n\r\n\"I must apologise for this intrusion,\" I said successfully.\r\n\"Unwarrantable\" would have rounded off the sentence neatly, but I would\r\nnot risk it. It would have been mere bravado to attempt unnecessary\r\nwords of five syllables. I took in more breath. \"The fact is, I\r\ndid--didn't know there was a private garden beyond the hedge. If you\r\nwill give me my hen ...\"\r\n\r\nI stopped. Aunt Elizabeth was looking away, as if endeavouring to\r\ncreate an impression of having nothing to do with me. I am told by one\r\nwho knows that hens cannot raise their eyebrows, not having any; but I\r\nam prepared to swear that at this moment Aunt Elizabeth raised hers. I\r\nwill go further. She sniffed.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are,\" said the man. \"Though it's hard to say good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out the hen to me, and at this point a hitch occurred. He did\r\nhis part, the letting go, all right. It was in my department, the\r\ntaking hold, that the thing was bungled. Aunt Elizabeth slipped from my\r\ngrasp like an eel, stood for a moment eyeing me satirically with her\r\nhead on one side, then fled and entrenched herself in some bushes at\r\nthe end of the lawn.\r\n\r\nThere are times when the most resolute man feels that he can battle no\r\nlonger with fate; when everything seems against him and the only course\r\nis a dignified retreat. But there is one thing essential to a dignified\r\nretreat. You must know the way out. It was the lack of that knowledge\r\nthat kept me standing there, looking more foolish than anyone has ever\r\nlooked since the world began. I could not retire by way of the hedge.\r\nIf I could have leaped the hedge with a single debonair bound, that\r\nwould have been satisfactory. But the hedge was high, and I did not\r\nfeel capable at the moment of achieving a debonair bound over a\r\nfootstool.\r\n\r\nThe man saved the situation. He seemed to possess that magnetic power\r\nover his fellows which marks the born leader. Under his command we\r\nbecame an organised army. The common object, the pursuit of the elusive\r\nAunt Elizabeth, made us friends. In the first minute of the proceedings\r\nthe Irishman was addressing me as \"me dear boy,\" and the man, who had\r\nintroduced himself as Mr. Chase--a lieutenant, I learned later, in His\r\nMajesty's Navy--was shouting directions to me by name. I have never\r\nassisted at any ceremony at which formality was so completely dispensed\r\nwith. The ice was not merely broken; it was shivered into a million\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n\"Go in and drive her out, Garnet,\" shouted Mr. Chase. \"In my direction\r\nif you can. Look out on the left, Phyllis.\"\r\n\r\nEven in that disturbing moment I could not help noticing his use of the\r\nChristian name. It seemed to me more than sinister. I did not like the\r\nidea of dashing young lieutenants in the senior service calling a girl\r\nPhyllis whose eyes had haunted me since I had first seen them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I crawled into the bushes and administered to Aunt\r\nElizabeth a prod in the lower ribs--if hens have lower ribs. The more I\r\nstudy hens, the more things they seem able to get along without--which\r\nabruptly disturbed her calm detachment. She shot out at the spot where\r\nMr. Chase was waiting with his coat off, and was promptly enveloped in\r\nthat garment and captured.\r\n\r\n\"The essence of strategy,\" observed Mr. Chase approvingly, \"is\r\nsurprise. A neat piece of work!\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him. He deprecated my thanks. He had, he said, only done his\r\nduty, as expected to by England. He then introduced me to the elderly\r\nIrishman, who was, it seemed, a professor at Dublin University, by\r\nname, Derrick. Whatever it was that he professed, it was something that\r\ndid not keep him for a great deal of his time at the University. He\r\ninformed me that he always spent his summers at Combe Regis.\r\n\r\n\"I was surprised to see you at Combe Regis,\" I said. \"When you got out\r\nat Yeovil, I thought I had seen the last of you.\"\r\n\r\nI think I am gifted beyond other men as regards the unfortunate turning\r\nof sentences.\r\n\r\n\"I meant,\" I added, \"I was afraid I had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, of course,\" he said, \"you were in our carriage coming down. I was\r\nconfident I had seen you before. I never forget a face.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a kindness,\" said Mr. Chase, \"if you would forget Garnet's\r\nas now exhibited. You seem to have collected a good deal of the scenery\r\ncoming through that hedge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was wondering----\" I said. \"A wash--if I might----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, me boy, of course,\" said the professor. \"Tom, take Mr.\r\nGarnet off to your room, and then we'll have lunch. You'll stay to\r\nlunch, Mr. Garnet?\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him, commented on possible inconvenience to his arrangements,\r\nwas overruled, and went off with my friend the lieutenant to the house.\r\nWe imprisoned Aunt Elizabeth in the stables, to her profound\r\nindignation, gave directions for lunch to be served to her, and made\r\nour way to Mr. Chase's room.\r\n\r\n\"So you've met the professor before?\" he said, hospitably laying out a\r\nchange of raiment for me--we were fortunately much of a height and\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\n\"I have never spoken to him,\" I said. \"We travelled down from London in\r\nthe same carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a dear old boy, if you rub him the right way. But--I'm telling\r\nyou this for your good and guidance; a man wants a chart in a strange\r\nsea--he can cut up rough. And, when he does, he goes off like a\r\nfour-point-seven and the population for miles round climbs trees. I\r\nthink, if I were you, I shouldn't mention Sir Edward Carson at lunch.\"\r\n\r\nI promised that I would try to avoid the temptation.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, you'd better keep off Ireland altogether. It's the safest\r\nplan. Any other subject you like. Chatty remarks on Bimetallism would\r\nmeet with his earnest attention. A lecture on What to do with the Cold\r\nMutton would be welcomed. But not Ireland. Shall we do down?\"\r\n\r\nWe got to know each other at lunch.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hunt hens,\" asked Tom Chase, who was mixing the salad--he was\r\none of those men who seemed to do everything a shade better than anyone\r\nelse--\"for amusement or by your doctor's orders? Many doctors, I\r\nbelieve, insist on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither,\" I said, \"and especially not for amusement. The fact is, I've\r\nbeen lured down here by a friend of mine who has started a chicken\r\nfarm--\"\r\n\r\nI was interrupted. All three of them burst out laughing. Tom Chase\r\nallowed the vinegar to trickle on to the cloth, missing the salad-bowl\r\nby a clear two inches.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to tell us,\" he said, \"that you really come from the\r\none and only chicken farm? Why, you're the man we've all been praying\r\nto meet for days past. You're the talk of the town. If you can call\r\nCombe Regis a town. Everybody is discussing you. Your methods are new\r\nand original, aren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably. Ukridge knows nothing about fowls. I know less. He considers\r\nit an advantage. He says our minds ought to be unbiassed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ukridge!\" said the professor. \"That was the name old Dawlish, the\r\ngrocer, said. I never forget a name. He is the gentleman who lectures\r\non the management of poultry? You do not?\"\r\n\r\nI hastened to disclaim any such feat. I had never really approved of\r\nthese infernal talks on the art of chicken-farming which Ukridge had\r\ndropped into the habit of delivering when anybody visited our farm. I\r\nadmit that it was a pleasing spectacle to see my managing director in a\r\npink shirt without a collar and very dirty flannel trousers lecturing\r\nthe intelligent native; but I had a feeling that the thing tended to\r\nexpose our ignorance to men who had probably had to do with fowls from\r\ntheir cradle up.\r\n\r\n\"His lectures are very popular,\" said Phyllis Derrick with a little\r\nsplutter of mirth.\r\n\r\n\"He enjoys them,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Garnet,\" said Tom Chase, \"I hope you won't consider all\r\nthese questions impertinent, but you've no notion of the thrilling\r\ninterest we all take--at a distance--in your farm. We have been talking\r\nof nothing else for a week. I have dreamed of it three nights running.\r\nIs Mr. Ukridge doing this as a commercial speculation, or is he an\r\neccentric millionaire?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's not a millionaire yet, but I believe he intends to be one\r\nshortly, with the assistance of the fowls. But you mustn't look on me\r\nas in any way responsible for the arrangements at the farm. I am merely\r\na labourer. The brainwork of the business lies in Ukridge's department.\r\nAs a matter of fact, I came down here principally in search of golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Golf?\" said Professor Derrick, with the benevolent approval of the\r\nenthusiast towards a brother. \"I'm glad you play golf. We must have a\r\nround together.\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as ever my professional duties will permit,\" I said gratefully.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nThere was croquet after lunch,--a game of which I am a poor performer.\r\nPhyllis Derrick and I played the professor and Tom Chase. Chase was a\r\nlittle better than myself; the professor, by dint of extreme\r\nearnestness and care, managed to play a fair game; and Phyllis was an\r\nexpert.\r\n\r\n\"I was reading a book,\" she said, as we stood together watching the\r\nprofessor shaping at his ball at the other end of the lawn, \"by an\r\nauthor of the same surname as you, Mr. Garnet. Is he a relation of\r\nyours?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Jeremy, Miss Derrick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you wrote it?\" She turned a little pink. \"Then you must have--oh,\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know what I was going to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guessed. You were going to say that I must have heard your\r\ncriticisms in the train. You were very lenient, I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't like your heroine.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. What is a 'creature,' Miss Derrick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pamela in your book is a 'creature,'\" she replied unsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nShortly after this the game came somehow to an end. I do not understand\r\nthe intricacies of croquet. But Phyllis did something brilliant and\r\nremarkable with the balls, and we adjourned for tea. The sun was\r\nsetting as I left to return to the farm, with Aunt Elizabeth stored\r\nneatly in a basket in my hand. The air was deliciously cool, and full\r\nof that strange quiet which follows soothingly on the skirts of a\r\nbroiling midsummer afternoon. Far away, seeming to come from another\r\nworld, a sheep-bell tinkled, deepening the silence. Alone in a sky of\r\nthe palest blue there gleamed a small, bright star.\r\n\r\nI addressed this star.\r\n\r\n\"She was certainly very nice to me. Very nice indeed.\" The star said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, I take it that, having had a decent up-bringing,\r\nshe would have been equally polite to any other man whom she had\r\nhappened to meet at her father's house. Moreover, I don't feel\r\naltogether easy in my mind about that naval chap. I fear the worst.\"\r\n\r\nThe star winked.\r\n\r\n\"He calls her Phyllis,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Charawk!\" chuckled Aunt Elizabeth from her basket, in that beastly\r\ncynical, satirical way which has made her so disliked by all\r\nright-thinking people."
