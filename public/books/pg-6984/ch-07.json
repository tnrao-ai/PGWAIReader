    "BARRETT EXPLORES\r\n\r\n\r\nBarrett stood at the window of his study with his hands in his pockets,\r\nlooking thoughtfully at the football field. Now and then he whistled.\r\nThat was to show that he was very much at his ease. He whistled a\r\npopular melody of the day three times as slowly as its talented\r\ncomposer had originally intended it to be whistled, and in a strange\r\nminor key. Some people, when offended, invariably whistle in this\r\nmanner, and these are just the people with whom, if you happen to share\r\na study with them, it is rash to have differences of opinion. Reade,\r\nwho was deep in a book--though not so deep as he would have liked the\r\ncasual observer to fancy him to be--would have given much to stop\r\nBarrett's musical experiments. To ask him to stop in so many words was,\r\nof course, impossible. Offended dignity must draw the line somewhere.\r\nThat is one of the curious results of a polite education. When two\r\ngentlemen of Hoxton or the Borough have a misunderstanding, they\r\naddress one another with even more freedom than is their usual custom.\r\nWhen one member of a public school falls out with another member, his\r\npoliteness in dealing with him becomes so Chesterfieldian, that one\r\ncannot help being afraid that he will sustain a strain from which he\r\nwill never recover.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the tension became too much for Barrett. He picked up his\r\ncap and left the room. Reade continued to be absorbed in his book.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid day outside, warm for April, and with just that\r\nfreshness in the air which gets into the blood and makes Spring the\r\nbest time of the whole year. Barrett had not the Ã¦sthetic soul to any\r\nappreciable extent, but he did know a fine day when he saw one, and\r\neven he realised that a day like this was not to be wasted in pottering\r\nabout the School grounds watching the 'under thirteen' hundred yards\r\n(trial heats) and the 'under fourteen' broad jump, or doing occasional\r\nexercises in the gymnasium. It was a day for going far afield and not\r\nreturning till lock-up. He had an object, too. Everything seemed to\r\nshout 'eggs' at him, to remind him that he was an enthusiast on the\r\nsubject and had a collection to which he ought to seize this excellent\r\nopportunity of adding. The only question was, where to go. The\r\nsurrounding country was a Paradise for the naturalist who had no absurd\r\nscruples on the subject of trespassing. To the west, in the direction\r\nof Stapleton, the woods and hedges were thick with nests. But then, so\r\nthey were to the east along the Badgwick road. He wavered, but a\r\nrecollection that there was water in the Badgwick direction, and that\r\nhe might with luck beard a water-wagtail in its lair, decided him. What\r\nis life without a water-wagtail's egg? A mere mockery. He turned east.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Barrett, where are you off to?' Grey, of Prater's House,\r\nintercepted him as he was passing.\r\n\r\n'Going to see if I can get some eggs. Are you coming?'\r\n\r\nGrey hesitated. He was a keen naturalist, too.\r\n\r\n'No, I don't think I will, thanks. Got an uncle coming down to see me.'\r\n\r\n'Well, cut off before he comes.'\r\n\r\n'No, he'd be too sick. Besides,' he added, ingenuously, 'there's a\r\npossible tip. Don't want to miss that. I'm simply stony. Always am at\r\nend of term.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Barrett, realising that further argument would be thrown\r\naway. 'Well, so long, then.'\r\n\r\n'So long. Hope you have luck.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks. I say.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'Roll-call, you know. If you don't see me anywhere about, you might\r\nanswer my name.'\r\n\r\n'All right. And if you find anything decent, you might remember me. You\r\nknow pretty well what I've got already.'\r\n\r\n'Right, I will.'\r\n\r\n'Magpie's what I want particularly. Where are you going, by the way?'\r\n\r\n'Thought of having a shot at old Venner's woods. I'm after a\r\nwater-wagtail myself. Ought to be one or two in the Dingle.'\r\n\r\n'Heaps, probably. But I should advise you to look out, you know.\r\nVenner's awfully down on trespassing.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the bounder. But I don't think he'll get me. One gets the knack\r\nof keeping fairly quiet with practice.'\r\n\r\n'He's got thousands of keepers.'\r\n\r\n'Millions.'\r\n\r\n'Dogs, too.'\r\n\r\n'Dash his beastly dogs. I like dogs. Why are you such a croaker today,\r\nGrey?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you know he's had two chaps sacked for going in his woods to my\r\ncertain knowledge, Morton-Smith and Ainsworth. That's only since I've\r\nbeen at the Coll., too. Probably lots more before that.'\r\n\r\n'Ainsworth was booked smoking there. That's why he was sacked. And\r\nVenner caught Morton-Smith himself simply staggering under dead\r\nrabbits. They sack any chap for poaching.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't see how you're going to show you've not been poaching.\r\nBesides, it's miles out of bounds.'\r\n\r\n'Grey,' said Barrett, severely, 'I'm surprised at you. Go away and meet\r\nyour beastly uncle. Fancy talking about bounds at your time of life.'\r\n\r\n'Well, don't forget me when you're hauling in the eggs.'\r\n\r\n'Right you are. So long.'\r\n\r\nBarrett proceeded on his way, his last difficulty safely removed. He\r\ncould rely on Grey not to bungle that matter of roll-call. Grey had\r\nbeen there before.\r\n\r\nA long white ribbon of dusty road separated St Austin's from the lodge\r\ngates of Badgwick Hall, the country seat of Sir Alfred Venner, M.P.,\r\nalso of 49A Lancaster Gate, London. Barrett walked rapidly for over\r\nhalf-an-hour before he came in sight of the great iron gates, flanked\r\non the one side by a trim little lodge and green meadows, and on the\r\nother by woods of a darker green. Having got so far, he went on up the\r\nhill till at last he arrived at his destination. A small hedge, a\r\nsloping strip of green, and then the famous Dingle. I am loath to\r\ninflict any scenic rhapsodies on the reader, but really the Dingle\r\ndeserves a line or two. It was the most beautiful spot in a country\r\nnoted for its fine scenery. Dense woods were its chief feature. And by\r\ndense I mean well-supplied not only with trees (excellent things in\r\nthemselves, but for the most part useless to the nest hunter), but also\r\nwith a fascinating tangle of undergrowth, where every bush seemed to\r\nharbour eggs. All carefully preserved, too. That was the chief charm of\r\nthe place. Since the sad episodes of Morton-Smith and Ainsworth, the\r\nSchool for the most part had looked askance at the Dingle. Once a\r\nselect party from Dacre's House, headed by Babington, who always got\r\nhimself into hot water when possible, had ventured into the forbidden\r\nland, and had returned hurriedly later in the afternoon with every sign\r\nof exhaustion, hinting breathlessly at keepers, dogs, and a pursuit\r\nthat had lasted fifty minutes without a check. Since then no one had\r\nbeen daring enough to brave the terrors so carefully prepared for them\r\nby Milord Sir Venner and his minions, and the proud owner of the Dingle\r\nwalked his woods in solitary state. Occasionally he would personally\r\nconduct some favoured guest thither and show him the wonders of the\r\nplace. But this was not a frequent occurrence. On still-less frequent\r\noccasions, there were large shooting parties in the Dingle. But, as a\r\nrule, the word was 'Keepers only. No others need apply'.\r\n\r\nA futile iron railing, some three feet in height, shut in the Dingle.\r\nBarrett jumped this lightly, and entered forthwith into Paradise. The\r\nplace was full of nests. As Barrett took a step forward there was a\r\nsudden whirring of wings, and a bird rose from a bush close beside him.\r\nHe went to inspect, and found a nest with seven eggs in it. Only a\r\nthrush, of course. As no one ever wants thrushes' eggs the world is\r\nover-stocked with them. Still, it gave promise of good things to come.\r\nBarrett pushed on through the bushes and the promise was fulfilled. He\r\ncame upon another nest. Five eggs this time, of a variety he was unable\r\nwith his moderate knowledge to classify. At any rate, he had not got\r\nthem in his collection. Nor, to the best of his belief, had Grey. He\r\ntook one for each of them.\r\n\r\nNow this was all very well, thought Barrett, but what he had come for\r\nwas the ovular deposit of the water-wagtail. Through the trees he could\r\nsee the silver gleam of the brook at the foot of the hill. The woods\r\nsloped down to the very edge. Then came the brook, widening out here\r\ninto the size of a small river. Then woods again all up the side of the\r\nopposite hill. Barrett hurried down the slope.\r\n\r\nHe had put on flannels for this emergency. He was prepared to wade, to\r\nswim if necessary. He hoped that it would not be necessary, for in\r\nApril water is generally inclined to be chilly. Of keepers he had up\r\ntill now seen no sign. Once he had heard the distant bark of a dog. It\r\nseemed to come from far across the stream and he had not troubled about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the bushes on the bank stood a tree. It was not tall\r\ncompared to the other trees of the Dingle, but standing alone as it did\r\namongst the undergrowth it attracted the eye at once. Barrett, looking\r\nat it, saw something which made him forget water-wagtails for the\r\nmoment. In a fork in one of the upper branches was a nest, an enormous\r\nnest, roughly constructed of sticks. It was a very jerry-built\r\nresidence, evidently run up for the season by some prudent bird who\r\nknew by experience that no nest could last through the winter, and so\r\nhad declined to waste his time in useless decorative work. But what\r\nbird was it? No doubt there are experts to whom a wood-pigeon's nest is\r\nsomething apart and distinct from the nest of the magpie, but to your\r\nunsophisticated amateur a nest that is large may be anything--rook's,\r\nmagpie's, pigeon's, or great auk's. To such an one the only true test\r\nlies in the eggs. _Solvitur ambulando_. Barrett laid the pill-boxes,\r\ncontaining the precious specimens he had found in the nest at the top\r\nof the hill, at the foot of the tree, and began to climb.\r\n\r\nIt was to be a day of surprises for him. When he had got half way up he\r\nfound himself on a kind of ledge, which appeared to be a kind of\r\njunction at which the tree branched off into two parts. To the left was\r\nthe nest, high up in its fork. To the right was another shoot. He\r\nrealised at once, with keen disappointment, that it would be useless to\r\ngo further. The branches were obviously not strong enough to bear his\r\nweight. He looked down, preparatory to commencing the descent, and to\r\nhis astonishment found himself looking into a black cavern. In his\r\neagerness to reach the nest he had not noticed before that the tree was\r\nhollow.\r\n\r\nThis made up for a great many things. His disappointment became less\r\nkeen. Few things are more interesting than a hollow tree.\r\n\r\n'Wonder how deep it goes down,' he said to himself. He broke off a\r\npiece of wood and dropped it down the hollow. It seemed to reach the\r\nground uncommonly soon. He tried another piece. The sound of its fall\r\ncame up to him almost simultaneously. Evidently the hole was not deep.\r\nHe placed his hands on the edge, and let himself gently down into the\r\ndarkness. His feet touched something solid almost immediately. As far\r\nas he could judge, the depth of the cavity was not more than five feet.\r\nStanding up at his full height he could just rest his chin on the edge.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be standing on some sort of a floor, roughly made, but too\r\nregular to be the work of nature. Evidently someone had been here\r\nbefore. He bent down to make certain. There was more room to move about\r\nin than he suspected. A man sitting down would find it not\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHe brushed his hand along the floor. Certainly it seemed to be\r\nconstructed of boards. Then his hand hit something small and hard. He\r\ngroped about until his fingers closed on it. It was--what was it? He\r\ncould hardly make out for the moment. Suddenly, as he moved it,\r\nsomething inside it rattled. Now he knew what it was. It was the very\r\nthing he most needed, a box of matches.\r\n\r\nThe first match he struck promptly and naturally went out. No first\r\nmatch ever stays alight for more than three-fifths of a second. The\r\nsecond was more successful. The sudden light dazzled him for a moment.\r\nWhen his eyes had grown accustomed to it, the match went out. He lit a\r\nthird, and this time he saw all round the little chamber.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott,' he said, 'the place is a regular poultry shop.'\r\n\r\nAll round the sides were hung pheasants and partridges in various\r\nstages of maturity. Here and there the fur of a rabbit or a hare showed\r\nup amongst the feathers. Barrett hit on the solution of the problem\r\ndirectly. He had been shown a similar collection once in a tree on his\r\nfather's land. The place was the headquarters of some poacher. Barrett\r\nwas full of admiration for the ingenuity of the man in finding so safe\r\na hiding-place.\r\n\r\nHe continued his search. In one angle of the tree was a piece of\r\nsacking. Barrett lifted it. He caught a glimpse of something bright,\r\nbut before he could confirm the vague suspicion that flashed upon him,\r\nhis match burnt down and lay smouldering on the floor. His hand\r\ntrembled with excitement as he started to light another. It broke off\r\nin his hand. At last he succeeded. The light flashed up, and there\r\nbeside the piece of sacking which had covered them were two cups. He\r\nrecognised them instantly.\r\n\r\n'Jove,' he gasped. 'The Sports pots! Now, how on earth--'\r\n\r\nAt this moment something happened which took his attention away from\r\nhis discovery with painful suddenness. From beneath him came the\r\nmuffled whine of a dog. He listened, holding his breath. No, he was not\r\nmistaken. The dog whined again, and broke into an excited bark.\r\nSomebody at the foot of the tree began to speak."
