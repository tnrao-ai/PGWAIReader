He is a blot, an excrescence. All those moments which\r\nare not spent in avoiding games (by means of that leave which is\r\nunanimously considered the peculiar property of the French nation) he\r\nuses in concocting ingenious excuses. Armed with these, he faces with\r\ncalmness the disgusting curiosity of the Game-Captain, who officiously\r\ndesires to know the reason of his non-appearance on the preceding day.\r\nThese excuses are of the \"had-to-go-and-see-a-man-about-a-dog\" type,\r\nand rarely meet with that success for which their author hopes. In the\r\nend he discovers that his chest is weak, or his heart is subject to\r\npalpitations, and he forthwith produces a document to this effect,\r\nsigned by a doctor. This has the desirable result of muzzling the\r\ntyrannical Game-Captain, whose sole solace is a look of intense and\r\nwithering scorn. But this is seldom fatal, and generally, we rejoice\r\nto say, ineffectual.\r\n\r\nThe next type is the partial slacker. He differs from the absolute\r\nslacker in that at rare intervals he actually turns up, changed withal\r\ninto the garb of the game, and thirsting for the fray. At this point\r\nbegins the time of trouble for the Game-Captain. To begin with, he is\r\nforced by stress of ignorance to ask the newcomer his name. This is,\r\nof course, an insult of the worst kind. \"A being who does not know my\r\nname,\" argues the partial slacker, \"must be something not far from a\r\ncriminal lunatic.\" The name is, however, extracted, and the partial\r\nslacker strides to the arena. Now arises insult No. 2. He is wearing\r\nhis cap. A hint as to the advisability of removing this pièce de\r\nrésistance not being taken, he is ordered to assume a capless state,\r\nand by these means a coolness springs up between him and the G. C. Of\r\nthis the Game-Captain is made aware when the game commences. The\r\npartial slacker, scorning to insert his head in the scrum, assumes a\r\ncommanding position outside and from this point criticises the\r\nGame-Captain's decisions with severity and pith. The last end of the\r\npartial slacker is generally a sad one. Stung by some pungent\r\nhome-thrust, the Game-Captain is fain to try chastisement, and by\r\nthese means silences the enemy's battery.\r\n\r\nSometimes the classes overlap. As for instance, a keen and regular\r\nplayer may, by some more than usually gross bit of bungling on the\r\npart of the G.-C., be moved to a fervour and eloquence worthy of\r\nJuvenal. Or, again, even the absolute slacker may for a time emulate\r\nthe keen player, provided an opponent plant a shrewd kick on a tender\r\nspot. But, broadly speaking, there are only three classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNFINISHED COLLECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nA silence had fallen upon the smoking room. The warrior just back from\r\nthe front had enquired after George Vanderpoop, and we, who knew that\r\nGeorge's gentle spirit had, to use a metaphor after his own heart,\r\nlong since been withdrawn from circulation, were feeling uncomfortable\r\nand wondering how to break the news.\r\n\r\nSmithson is our specialist in tact, and we looked to him to be\r\nspokesman.\r\n\r\n\"George,\" said Smithson at last, \"the late George Vanderpoop----\"\r\n\r\n\"Late!\" exclaimed the warrior; \"is he dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a doornail,\" replied Smithson sadly. \"Perhaps you would care to\r\nhear the story. It is sad, but interesting. You may recollect that,\r\nwhen you sailed, he was starting his journalistic career. For a young\r\nwriter he had done remarkably well. The _Daily Telephone_ had\r\nprinted two of his contributions to their correspondence column, and a\r\nbright pen picture of his, describing how Lee's Lozenges for the Liver\r\nhad snatched him from almost certain death, had quite a vogue. Lee, I\r\nbelieve, actually commissioned him to do a series on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said the warrior.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was, as I say, prospering very fairly, when in an unlucky\r\nmoment he began to make a collection of editorial rejection forms. He\r\nhad always been a somewhat easy prey to scourges of that description.\r\nBut when he had passed safely through a sharp attack of Philatelism\r\nand a rather nasty bout of Autographomania, everyone hoped and\r\nbelieved that he had turned the corner. The progress of his last\r\nillness was very rapid. Within a year he wanted but one specimen to\r\nmake the complete set. This was the one published from the offices of\r\nthe _Scrutinizer_. All the rest he had obtained with the greatest\r\nease. I remember his telling me that a single short story of his,\r\ncalled 'The Vengeance of Vera Dalrymple,' had been instrumental in\r\nsecuring no less than thirty perfect specimens. Poor George! I was\r\nwith him when he made his first attempt on the _Scrutinizer_. He\r\nhad baited his hook with an essay on Evolution. He read me one or two\r\npassages from it. I stopped him at the third paragraph, and\r\ncongratulated him in advance, little thinking that it was sympathy\r\nrather than congratulations that he needed. When I saw him a week\r\nafterwards he was looking haggard. I questioned him, and by slow\r\ndegrees drew out the story. The article on Evolution had been printed.\r\n\r\n\"'Never say die, George,' I said. 'Send them \"Vera Dalrymple.\" No\r\npaper can take that.'\r\n\r\n\"He sent it. The _Scrutinizer_, which had been running for nearly\r\na century without publishing a line of fiction, took it and asked for\r\nmore. It was as if there were an editorial conspiracy against him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said the man of war.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Smithson, \"George pulled himself together. He wrote a\r\nparody of 'The Minstrel Boy.' I have seen a good many parodies, but\r\nnever such a parody as that. By return of post came a long envelope\r\nbearing the crest of the _Scrutinizer_. 'At last,' he said, as he\r\ntore it open.\r\n\r\n\"'George, old man,' I said, 'your hand.'\r\n\r\n\"He looked at me a full minute. Then with a horrible, mirthless laugh\r\nhe fell to the ground, and expired almost instantly. You will readily\r\nguess what killed him. The poem had been returned, _but without a\r\nrejection form!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ADVERTISING\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In Denmark,\" said the man of ideas, coming into the smoking room, \"I\r\nsee that they have original ideas on the subject of advertising.\r\nAccording to the usually well-informed Daily Lyre, all 'bombastic'\r\nadvertising is punished with a fine. The advertiser is expected to\r\ndescribe his wares in restrained, modest language. In case this idea\r\nshould be introduced into England, I have drawn up a few specimen\r\nadvertisements which, in my opinion, combine attractiveness with a\r\nshrinking modesty at which no censor could cavil.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of our protests, he began to read us his first effort,\r\ndescriptive of a patent medicine.\r\n\r\n\"It runs like this,\" he said:\r\n\r\n     Timson's Tonic for Distracted Deadbeats\r\n     Has been known to cure\r\n     We Hate to Seem to Boast,\r\n     but\r\n     Many Who have Tried It Are Still\r\n     Alive\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Take a Dose or Two in Your Spare Time\r\n     It's Not Bad Stuff\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Read what an outside stockbroker says:\r\n     \"Sir--After three months' steady absorption of your Tonic\r\n     I was no worse.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     We do not wish to thrust ourselves forward in any way. If\r\n     you prefer other medicines, by all means take them. Only we\r\n     just thought we'd mention it--casually, as it were--that TIMSON'S\r\n     is PRETTY GOOD.\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" inquired the man of ideas. \"Attractive, I fancy, without\r\nbeing bombastic. Now, one about a new novel. Ready?\"\r\n\r\n       MR. LUCIEN LOGROLLER'S LATEST\r\n\r\n         The Dyspepsia of the Soul\r\n         The Dyspepsia of the Soul\r\n         The Dyspepsia of the Soul\r\n\r\n    Don't buy it if you don't want to, but just\r\n    listen to a few of the criticisms.\r\n\r\n         THE DYSPEPSIA OF THE SOUL\r\n\r\n    \"Rather ... rubbish.\"--_Spectator_\r\n\r\n    \"We advise all insomniacs to read Mr. Logroller's soporific\r\n     pages.\"--_Outlook_\r\n\r\n    \"Rot.\"--_Pelican_\r\n\r\n        THE DYSPEPSIA OF THE SOUL\r\n      Already in its first edition.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of that?\" asked the man of ideas.\r\n\r\nWe told him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET PLEASURES OF REGINALD\r\n\r\n\r\nI found Reggie in the club one Saturday afternoon. He was reclining in\r\na long chair, motionless, his eyes fixed glassily on the ceiling. He\r\nfrowned a little when I spoke. \"You don't seem to be doing anything,\"\r\nI said.\r\n\r\n\"It's not what I'm doing, it's what I am _not_ doing that\r\nmatters.\"\r\n\r\nIt sounded like an epigram, but epigrams are so little associated with\r\nReggie that I ventured to ask what he meant.\r\n\r\nHe sighed. \"Ah well,\" he said. \"I suppose the sooner I tell you, the\r\nsooner you'll go. Do you know Bodfish?\"\r\n\r\nI shuddered. \"Wilkinson Bodfish? I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever spent a weekend at Bodfish's place in the country?\"\r\n\r\nI shuddered again. \"I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm _not_ spending the weekend at Bodfish's place in the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you're not. But----\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand. I do not mean that I am simply absent from\r\nBodfish's place in the country. I mean that I am _deliberately_\r\nnot spending the weekend there. When you interrupted me just now, I\r\nwas not strolling down to Bodfish's garage, listening to his prattle\r\nabout his new car.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced around uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Reggie, old man, you're--you're not--This hot weather----\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly well, and in possession of all my faculties. Now tell\r\nme. Can you imagine anything more awful than to spend a weekend with\r\nBodfish?\"\r\n\r\nOn the spur of the moment I could not.\r\n\r\n\"Can you imagine anything more delightful, then, than _not_\r\nspending a weekend with Bodfish? Well, that's what I'm doing now.\r\nSoon, when you have gone--if you have any other engagements, please\r\ndon't let me keep you--I shall not go into the house and not listen to\r\nMrs. Bodfish on the subject of young Willie Bodfish's premature\r\nintelligence.\"\r\n\r\nI got his true meaning. \"I see. You mean that you will be thanking\r\nyour stars that you aren't with Bodfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is it, put crudely. But I go further. I don't indulge in a mere\r\nmomentary self-congratulation, I do the thing thoroughly. If I were\r\nweekending at Bodfish's, I should have arrived there just half an hour\r\nago. I therefore selected that moment for beginning not to weekend\r\nwith Bodfish. I settled myself in this chair and I did not have my\r\nback slapped at the station. A few minutes later I was not whirling\r\nalong the country roads, trying to balance the car with my legs and an\r\nelbow. Time passed, and I was not shaking hands with Mrs. Bodfish. I\r\nhave just had the most corking half-hour, and shortly--when you have\r\nremembered an appointment--I shall go on having it. What I am really\r\nlooking forward to is the happy time after dinner. I shall pass it in\r\nnot playing bridge with Bodfish, Mrs. Bodfish, and a neighbor. Sunday\r\nmorning is the best part of the whole weekend, though. That is when I\r\nshall most enjoy myself. Do you know a man named Pringle? Next\r\nSaturday I am not going to stay with Pringle. I forget who is not to\r\nbe my host the Saturday after that. I have so many engagements of this\r\nkind that I lose track of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Reggie, this is genius. You have hit on the greatest idea of the\r\nage. You might extend this system of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. Some of the jolliest evenings I have spent have been not at the\r\ntheatre.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often wondered what it was that made you look so fit and\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. These little non-visits of mine pick me up and put life into me\r\nfor the coming week. I get up on Monday morning feeling like a lion.\r\nThe reason I selected Bodfish this week, though I was practically\r\nengaged to a man named Stevenson who lives out in Connecticut, was\r\nthat I felt rundown and needed a real rest. I shall be all right on\r\nMonday.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so shall I,\" I said, sinking into the chair beside him.\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to the country?\" he asked regretfully.\r\n\r\n\"I am not. I, too, need a tonic. I shall join you at Bodfish's. I\r\nreally feel a lot better already.\"\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes, and relaxed, and a great peace settled upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY BATTLE WITH DRINK\r\n\r\n\r\nI could tell my story in two words--the two words \"I drank.\" But I was\r\nnot always a drinker. This is the story of my downfall--and of my\r\nrise--for through the influence of a good woman, I have, thank Heaven,\r\nrisen from the depths.\r\n\r\nThe thing stole upon me gradually, as it does upon so many young men.\r\nAs a boy, I remember taking a glass of root beer, but it did not grip\r\nme then. I can recall that I even disliked the taste. I was a young\r\nman before temptation really came upon me. My downfall began when I\r\njoined the Yonkers Shorthand and Typewriting College.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I first made acquaintance with the awful power of\r\nridicule. They were a hard-living set at college--reckless youths.\r\nThey frequented movie palaces. They thought nothing of winding up an\r\nevening with a couple of egg-phosphates and a chocolate fudge. They\r\nlaughed at me when I refused to join them. I was only twenty. My\r\ncharacter was undeveloped. I could not endure their scorn. The next\r\ntime I was offered a drink I accepted. They were pleased, I remember.\r\nThey called me \"Good old Plum!\" and a good sport and other\r\ncomplimentary names. I was intoxicated with sudden popularity.\r\n\r\nHow vividly I can recall that day! The shining counter, the placards\r\nadvertising strange mixtures with ice cream as their basis, the busy\r\nmen behind the counter, the half-cynical, half-pitying eyes of the\r\ngirl in the cage where you bought the soda checks. She had seen so\r\nmany happy, healthy boys through that little hole in the wire netting,\r\nso many thoughtless boys all eager for their first soda, clamoring to\r\nset their foot on the primrose path that leads to destruction.\r\n\r\nIt was an apple marshmallow sundae, I recollect. I dug my spoon into\r\nit with an assumption of gaiety which I was far from feeling. The\r\nfirst mouthful almost nauseated me. It was like cold hair-oil. But I\r\nstuck to it. I could not break down now. I could not bear to forfeit\r\nthe newly-won esteem of my comrades. They were gulping their sundaes\r\ndown with the speed and enjoyment of old hands. I set my teeth, and\r\npersevered, and by degrees a strange exhilaration began to steal over\r\nme. I felt that I had burnt my boats and bridges; that I had crossed\r\nthe Rubicon. I was reckless. I ordered another round. I was the life\r\nand soul of that party.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought remorse. I did not feel well. I had pains,\r\nphysical and mental. But I could not go back now. I was too weak to\r\ndispense with my popularity. I was only a boy, and on the previous\r\nevening the captain of the Checkers Club, to whom I looked up with an\r\nalmost worshipping reverence, had slapped me on the back and told me\r\nthat I was a corker. I felt that nothing could be excessive payment\r\nfor such an honor. That night I gave a party at which orange phosphate\r\nflowed like water. It was the turning point.\r\n\r\nI had got the habit!\r\n\r\nI will pass briefly over the next few years. I continued to sink\r\ndeeper and deeper into the slough. I knew all the drugstore clerks in\r\nNew York by their first names, and they called me by mine. I no longer\r\neven had to specify the abomination I desired. I simply handed the man\r\nmy ten cent check and said: \"The usual, Jimmy,\" and he understood.\r\n\r\nAt first, considerations of health did not trouble me. I was young and\r\nstrong, and my constitution quickly threw off the effects of my\r\ndissipation. Then, gradually, I began to feel worse. I was losing my\r\ngrip. I found a difficulty in concentrating my attention on my work. I\r\nhad dizzy spells. I became nervous and distrait. Eventually I went to\r\na doctor. He examined me thoroughly, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"If I am to do you any good,\" he said, \"you must tell me all. You must\r\nhold no secrets from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" I said, covering my face with my hands, \"I am a confirmed\r\nsoda-fiend.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave me a long lecture and a longer list of instructions. I must\r\ntake air and exercise and I must become a total abstainer from sundaes\r\nof all descriptions. I must avoid limeade like the plague, and if\r\nanybody offered me a Bulgarzoon I was to knock him down and shout for\r\nthe nearest policeman.\r\n\r\nI learned then for the first time what a bitterly hard thing it is for\r\na man in a large and wicked city to keep from soda when once he has\r\ngot the habit. Everything was against me. The old convivial circle\r\nbegan to shun me. I could not join in their revels and they began to\r\nlook on me as a grouch. In the end, I fell, and in one wild orgy undid\r\nall the good of a month's abstinence. I was desperate then. I felt\r\nthat nothing could save me, and I might as well give up the struggle.\r\nI drank two pin-ap-o-lades, three grapefruit-olas and an egg-zoolak,\r\nbefore pausing to take breath.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the next day, I met May, the girl who effected my\r\nreformation. She was a clergyman's daughter who, to support her\r\nwidowed mother, had accepted a non-speaking part in a musical comedy\r\nproduction entitled \"Oh Joy! Oh Pep!\" Our acquaintance ripened, and\r\none night I asked her out to supper.\r\n\r\nI look on that moment as the happiest of my life. I met her at the\r\nstage door, and conducted her to the nearest soda-fountain. We were\r\ninside and I was buying the checks before she realized where she was,\r\nand I shall never forget her look of mingled pain and horror.\r\n\r\n\"And I thought you were a live one!\" she murmured.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that she had been looking forward to a little lobster and\r\nchampagne. The idea was absolutely new to me. She quickly convinced\r\nme, however, that such was the only refreshment which she would\r\nconsider, and she recoiled with unconcealed aversion from my\r\nsuggestion of a Mocha Malted and an Eva Tanguay. That night I tasted\r\nwine for the first time, and my reformation began.\r\n\r\nIt was hard at first, desperately hard. Something inside me was trying\r\nto pull me back to the sundaes for which I craved, but I resisted the\r\nimpulse. Always with her divinely sympathetic encouragement, I\r\ngradually acquired a taste for alcohol. And suddenly, one evening,\r\nlike a flash it came upon me that I had shaken off the cursed yoke\r\nthat held me down: that I never wanted to see the inside of a\r\ndrugstore again. Cocktails, at first repellent, have at last become\r\npalatable to me. I drink highballs for breakfast. I am saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN DEFENSE OF ASTIGMATISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is peculiarly an age where novelists pride themselves on the\r\nbreadth of their outlook and the courage with which they refuse to\r\nignore the realities of life; and never before have authors had such\r\nscope in the matter of the selection of heroes. In the days of the\r\nold-fashioned novel, when the hero was automatically Lord Blank or Sir\r\nRalph Asterisk, there were, of course, certain rules that had to be\r\nobserved, but today--why, you can hardly hear yourself think for the\r\nuproar of earnest young novelists proclaiming how free and unfettered\r\nthey are. And yet, no writer has had the pluck to make his hero wear\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, as I say, this was all very well. The hero was a\r\nyoung lordling, sprung from a line of ancestors who had never done\r\nanything with their eyes except wear a piercing glance before which\r\nlesser men quailed. But now novelists go into every class of society\r\nfor their heroes, and surely, at least an occasional one of them must\r\nhave been astigmatic. Kipps undoubtedly wore glasses; so did Bunker\r\nBean; so did Mr. Polly, Clayhanger, Bibbs, Sheridan, and a score of\r\nothers. Then why not say so?\r\n\r\nNovelists are moving with the times in every other direction. Why not\r\nin this?\r\n\r\nIt is futile to advance the argument that glasses are unromantic. They\r\nare not. I know, because I wear them myself, and I am a singularly\r\nromantic figure, whether in my rimless, my Oxford gold-bordered, or\r\nthe plain gent's spectacles which I wear in the privacy of my study.\r\n\r\nBesides, everybody wears glasses nowadays. That is the point I wish to\r\nmake. For commercial reasons, if for no others, authors ought to think\r\nseriously of this matter of goggling their heroes. It is an admitted\r\nfact that the reader of a novel likes to put himself in the hero's\r\nplace--to imagine, while reading, that he is the hero. What an\r\naudience the writer of the first romance to star a spectacled hero\r\nwill have. All over the country thousands of short-sighted men will\r\npolish their glasses and plunge into his pages. It is absurd to go on\r\nwriting in these days for a normal-sighted public. The growing\r\ntenseness of life, with its small print, its newspapers read by\r\nartificial light, and its flickering motion pictures, is whittling\r\ndown the section of the populace which has perfect sight to a mere\r\nhandful.\r\n\r\nI seem to see that romance. In fact, I think I shall write it myself.\r\n\"'Evadne,' murmured Clarence, removing his pince-nez and polishing\r\nthem tenderly....'\" \"'See,' cried Clarence, 'how clearly every leaf of\r\nyonder tree is mirrored in the still water of the lake. I can't see\r\nmyself, unfortunately, for I have left my glasses on the parlor piano,\r\nbut don't worry about me: go ahead and see!\" ... \"Clarence adjusted his\r\ntortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles with a careless gesture, and faced the\r\nassassins without a tremor.\" Hot stuff? Got the punch? I should say\r\nso. Do you imagine that there will be a single man in this country\r\nwith the price of the book in his pocket and a pair of pince-nez on\r\nhis face who will not scream and kick like an angry child if you\r\nwithhold my novel from him?\r\n\r\nAnd just pause for a moment to think of the serial and dramatic rights\r\nof the story. All editors wear glasses, so do all theatrical managers.\r\nMy appeal will be irresistible. All I shall have to do will be to see\r\nthat the check is for the right figure and to supervise the placing of\r\nthe electric sign\r\n\r\n    SPECTACLES OF FATE\r\n\r\n    BY P. G. WODEHOUSE\r\n\r\nover the doors of whichever theatre I happen to select for the\r\nproduction of the play.\r\n\r\nHave you ever considered the latent possibilities for dramatic\r\nsituations in short sight? You know how your glasses cloud over when\r\nyou come into a warm room out of the cold? Well, imagine your hero in\r\nsuch a position. He has been waiting outside the murderer's den\r\npreparatory to dashing in and saving the heroine. He dashes in. \"Hands\r\nup, you scoundrels,\" he cries. And then his glasses get all misty, and\r\nthere he is, temporarily blind, with a full-size desperado backing\r\naway and measuring the distance in order to hand him one with a\r\npickaxe.\r\n\r\nOr would you prefer something less sensational, something more in the\r\nromantic line? Very well. Hero, on his way to the Dowager Duchess's\r\nball, slips on a banana-peel and smashes his only pair of spectacles.\r\nHe dare not fail to attend the ball, for the dear Duchess would never\r\nforgive him; so he goes in and proposes to a girl he particularly\r\ndislikes because she is dressed in pink, and the heroine told him that\r\nshe was going to wear pink. But the heroine's pink dress was late in\r\ncoming home from the modiste's and she had to turn up in blue. The\r\nheroine comes in just as the other girl is accepting him, and there\r\nyou have a nice, live, peppy, kick-off for your tale of passion and\r\nhuman interest.\r\n\r\nBut I have said enough to show that the time has come when novelists,\r\nif they do not wish to be left behind in the race, must adapt\r\nthemselves to modern conditions. One does not wish to threaten, but,\r\nas I say, we astigmatics are in a large minority and can, if we get\r\ntogether, make our presence felt. Roused by this article to a sense of\r\nthe injustice of their treatment, the great army of glass-wearing\r\ncitizens could very easily make novelists see reason. A boycott of\r\nnon-spectacled heroes would soon achieve the necessary reform. Perhaps\r\nthere will be no need to let matters go as far as that. I hope not.\r\nBut, if this warning should be neglected, if we have any more of these\r\nnovels about men with keen gray eyes or snapping black eyes or\r\ncheerful blue eyes--any sort of eyes, in fact, lacking some muscular\r\naffliction, we shall know what to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHERS AND ME\r\n\r\n\r\nI look in my glass, dear reader, and what do I see? Nothing so\r\nfrightfully hot, believe me. The face is slablike, the ears are large\r\nand fastened on at right-angles. Above the eyebrows comes a stagnant\r\nsea of bald forehead, stretching away into the distance with nothing\r\nto relieve it but a few wisps of lonely hair. The nose is blobby, the\r\neyes dull, like those of a fish not in the best of health. A face, in\r\nshort, taking it for all in all, which should be reserved for the gaze\r\nof my nearest and dearest who, through long habit, have got used to it\r\nand can see through to the pure white soul beneath. At any rate, a\r\nface not to be scattered about at random and come upon suddenly by\r\nnervous people and invalids.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, just because I am an author, I have to keep on being\r\nphotographed. It is the fault of publishers and editors, of course,\r\nreally, but it is the photographer who comes in for the author's hate.\r\n\r\nSomething has got to be done about this practice of publishing\r\nauthors' photographs. We have to submit to it, because editors and\r\npublishers insist. They have an extraordinary superstition that it\r\nhelps an author's sales. The idea is that the public sees the\r\nphotograph, pauses spell-bound for an instant, and then with a cry of\r\necstasy rushes off to the book-shop and buys copy after copy of the\r\ngargoyle's latest novel.\r\n\r\nOf course, in practice, it works out just the other way. People read a\r\nreview of an author's book and are told that it throbs with a passion\r\nso intense as almost to be painful, and are on the point of digging\r\nseven-and-sixpence out of their child's money-box to secure a copy,\r\nwhen their eyes fall on the man's photograph at the side of the\r\nreview, and they find that he has a face like a rabbit and wears\r\nspectacles and a low collar. And this man is the man who is said to\r\nhave laid bare the soul of a woman as with a scalpel.\r\n\r\nNaturally their faith is shaken. They feel that a man like that cannot\r\npossibly know anything about Woman or any other subject except where\r\nto go for a vegetarian lunch, and the next moment they have put down\r\nthe hair-pin and the child is seven-and-six in hand and the author his\r\nten per cent., or whatever it is, to the bad. And all because of a\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\nFor the ordinary man, the recent introduction of high-art methods into\r\nphotography has done much to diminish the unpleasantness of the\r\noperation. In the old days of crude and direct posing, there was no\r\nescape for the sitter. He had to stand up, backed by a rustic stile\r\nand a flabby canvas sheet covered with exotic trees, glaring straight\r\ninto the camera. To prevent any eleventh-hour retreat, a sort of spiky\r\nthing was shoved firmly into the back of his head leaving him with the\r\nchoice of being taken as he stood or having an inch of steel jabbed\r\ninto his skull. Modern methods have changed all that.\r\n\r\nThere are no photographs nowadays. Only \"camera portraits\" and \"lens\r\nimpressions.\" The full face has been abolished. The ideal of the\r\npresent-day photographer is to eliminate the sitter as far as possible\r\nand concentrate on a general cloudy effect. I have in my possession\r\ntwo studies of my Uncle Theodore--one taken in the early 'nineties,\r\nthe other in the present year. The first shows him, evidently in pain,\r\nstaring before him with a fixed expression. In his right hand he\r\ngrasps a scroll. His left rests on a moss-covered wall. Two sea-gulls\r\nare flying against a stormy sky.\r\n\r\nAs a likeness, it is almost brutally exact. My uncle stands forever\r\ncondemned as the wearer of a made-up tie.\r\n\r\nThe second is different in every respect. Not only has the sitter been\r\ntaken in the popular modern \"one-twentieth face,\" showing only the\r\nback of the head, the left ear and what is either a pimple or a flaw\r\nin the print, but the whole thing is plunged in the deepest shadow. It\r\nis as if my uncle had been surprised by the camera while chasing a\r\nblack cat in his coal-cellar on a moonlight night. There is no\r\nquestion as to which of the two makes the more attractive picture. My\r\nfamily resemble me in that respect. The less you see of us, the better\r\nwe look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLEA FOR INDOOR GOLF\r\n\r\n\r\nIndoor golf is that which is played in the home. Whether you live in a\r\npalace or a hovel, an indoor golf-course, be it only of nine holes, is\r\nwell within your reach. A house offers greater facilities than an\r\napartment, and I have found my game greatly improved since I went to\r\nlive in the country. I can, perhaps, scarcely do better than give a\r\nbrief description of the sporting nine-hole course which I have\r\nrecently laid out in my present residence.\r\n\r\nAll authorities agree that the first hole on every links should be\r\nmoderately easy, in order to give the nervous player a temporary and\r\nfictitious confidence.\r\n\r\nAt Wodehouse Manor, therefore, we drive off from the front door--in\r\norder to get the benefit of the door-mat--down an entry fairway,\r\ncarpeted with rugs and without traps. The hole--a loving-cup--is just\r\nunder the stairs; and a good player ought to have no difficulty in\r\ndoing it in two.\r\n\r\nThe second hole, a short and simple one, takes you into the telephone\r\nbooth. Trouble begins with the third, a long dog-leg hole through the\r\nkitchen into the dining-room. This hole is well trapped with\r\ntable-legs, kitchen utensils, and a moving hazard in the person of\r\nClarence the cat, who is generally wandering about the fairway. The\r\nhole is under the glass-and-china cupboard, where you are liable to be\r\nbunkered if you loft your approach-shot excessively.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and fifth holes call for no comment. They are without\r\ntraps, the only danger being that you may lose a stroke through\r\nhitting the maid if she happens to be coming down the back stairs\r\nwhile you are taking a mashie-shot. This is a penalty under the local\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThe sixth is the indispensable water-hole. It is short, but tricky.\r\nTeeing off from just outside the bathroom door, you have to loft the\r\nball over the side of the bath, holing out in the little vent pipe, at\r\nthe end where the water runs out.\r\n\r\nThe seventh is the longest hole on the course. Starting at the\r\nentrance of the best bedroom, a full drive takes you to the head of\r\nthe stairs, whence you will need at least two more strokes to put you\r\ndead on the pin in the drawing-room. In the drawing-room the fairway\r\nis trapped with photograph frames--with glass, complete--these serving\r\nas casual water: and anyone who can hole out on the piano in five or\r\nunder is a player of class. Bogey is six, and I have known even such a\r\ncapable exponent of the game as my Uncle Reginald, who is plus two on\r\nhis home links on Park Avenue, to take twenty-seven at the hole. But\r\non that occasion he had the misfortune to be bunkered in a photograph\r\nof my Aunt Clara and took no fewer than eleven strokes with his\r\nniblick to extricate himself from it.\r\n\r\nThe eighth and ninth holes are straightforward, and can be done in two\r\nand three respectively, provided you swing easily and avoid the\r\ncanary's cage. Once trapped there, it is better to give up the hole\r\nwithout further effort. It is almost impossible to get out in less\r\nthan fifty-six, and after you have taken about thirty the bird gets\r\nvisibly annoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALARMING SPREAD OF POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the thinking man there are few things more disturbing than the\r\nrealization that we are becoming a nation of minor poets. In the good\r\nold days poets were for the most part confined to garrets, which they\r\nleft only for the purpose of being ejected from the offices of\r\nmagazines and papers to which they attempted to sell their wares.\r\nNobody ever thought of reading a book of poems unless accompanied by a\r\nguarantee from the publisher that the author had been dead at least a\r\nhundred years. Poetry, like wine, certain brands of cheese, and public\r\nbuildings, was rightly considered to improve with age; and no\r\nconnoisseur could have dreamed of filling himself with raw,\r\nindigestible verse, warm from the maker.\r\n\r\nToday, however, editors are paying real money for poetry; publishers\r\nare making a profit on books of verse; and many a young man who, had\r\nhe been born earlier, would have sustained life on a crust of bread,\r\nis now sending for the manager to find out how the restaurant dares\r\ntry to sell a fellow champagne like this as genuine Pommery Brut.\r\nNaturally this is having a marked effect on the life of the community.\r\nOur children grow to adolescence with the feeling that they can become\r\npoets instead of working. Many an embryo bill clerk has been ruined by\r\nthe heady knowledge that poems are paid for at the rate of a dollar a\r\nline. All over the country promising young plasterers and rising young\r\nmotormen are throwing up steady jobs in order to devote themselves to\r\nthe new profession. On a sunny afternoon down in Washington Square\r\none's progress is positively impeded by the swarms of young poets\r\nbrought out by the warm weather. It is a horrible sight to see those\r\nunfortunate youths, who ought to be sitting happily at desks writing\r\n\"Dear Sir, Your favor of the tenth inst. duly received and contents\r\nnoted. In reply we beg to state....\" wandering about with their\r\nfingers in their hair and their features distorted with the agony of\r\ncomposition, as they try to find rhymes to \"cosmic\" and \"symbolism.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as if matters were not bad enough already, along comes Mr. Edgar\r\nLee Masters and invents _vers libre_. It is too early yet to\r\njudge the full effects of this man's horrid discovery, but there is no\r\ndoubt that he has taken the lid off and unleashed forces over which\r\nnone can have any control. All those decent restrictions which used to\r\ncheck poets have vanished, and who shall say what will be the outcome?\r\n\r\nUntil Mr. Masters came on the scene there was just one thing which,\r\nlike a salient fortress in the midst of an enemy's advancing army,\r\nacted as a barrier to the youth of the country. When one's son came to\r\none and said, \"Father, I shall not be able to fulfill your dearest\r\nwish and start work in the fertilizer department. I have decided to\r\nbecome a poet,\" although one could no longer frighten him from his\r\npurpose by talking of garrets and starvation, there was still one\r\nweapon left. \"What about the rhymes, Willie?\" you replied, and the\r\neager light died out of the boy's face, as he perceived the catch in\r\nwhat he had taken for a good thing. You pressed your advantage. \"Think\r\nof having to spend your life making one line rhyme with another! Think\r\nof the bleak future, when you have used up 'moon' and 'June,' 'love'\r\nand 'dove,' 'May' and 'gay'! Think of the moment when you have ended\r\nthe last line but one of your poem with 'windows' or 'warmth' and have\r\nto buckle to, trying to make the thing couple up in accordance with\r\nthe rules! What then, Willie?\"\r\n\r\nNext day a new hand had signed on in the fertilizer department.\r\n\r\nBut now all that has changed. Not only are rhymes no longer necessary,\r\nbut editors positively prefer them left out. If Longfellow had been\r\nwriting today he would have had to revise \"The Village Blacksmith\" if\r\nhe wanted to pull in that dollar a line. No editor would print stuff\r\nlike:\r\n\r\n    Under the spreading chestnut tree\r\n      The village smithy stands.\r\n    The smith a brawny man is he\r\n      With large and sinewy hands.\r\n\r\nIf Longfellow were living in these hyphenated, free and versy days, he\r\nwould find himself compelled to take his pen in hand and dictate as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    In life I was the village smith,\r\n    I worked all day\r\n    But\r\n    I retained the delicacy of my complexion\r\n    Because\r\n    I worked in the shade of the chestnut tree\r\n    Instead of in the sun\r\n    Like Nicholas Blodgett, the expressman.\r\n    I was large and strong\r\n    Because\r\n    I went in for physical culture\r\n    And deep breathing\r\n    And all those stunts.\r\n    I had the biggest biceps in Spoon River.\r\n\r\nWho can say where this thing will end? _Vers libre_ is within the\r\nreach of all. A sleeping nation has wakened to the realization that\r\nthere is money to be made out of chopping its prose into bits.\r\nSomething must be done shortly if the nation is to be saved from this\r\nmenace. But what? It is no good shooting Edgar Lee Masters, for the\r\nmischief has been done, and even making an example of him could not\r\nundo it. Probably the only hope lies in the fact that poets never buy\r\nother poets' stuff. When once we have all become poets, the sale of\r\nverse will cease or be limited to the few copies which individual\r\npoets will buy to give to their friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LIFE AS A DRAMATIC CRITIC\r\n\r\n\r\nI had always wanted to be a dramatic critic. A taste for sitting back\r\nand watching other people work, so essential to the make-up of this\r\nsub-species of humanity, has always been one of the leading traits in\r\nmy character.\r\n\r\nI have seldom missed a first night. No sooner has one periodical got\r\nrid of me than another has had the misfortune to engage me, with the\r\nresult that I am now the foremost critic of the day, read assiduously\r\nby millions, fawned upon by managers, courted by stagehands. My\r\nlightest word can make or mar a new production. If I say a piece is\r\nbad, it dies. It may not die instantly. Generally it takes forty weeks\r\nin New York and a couple of seasons on the road to do it, but it\r\ncannot escape its fate. Sooner or later it perishes. That is the sort\r\nof man I am.\r\n\r\nWhatever else may be charged against me, I have never deviated from\r\nthe standard which I set myself at the beginning of my career. If I am\r\ncalled upon to review a play produced by a manager who is considering\r\none of my own works, I do not hesitate. I praise that play.\r\n\r\nIf an actor has given me a lunch, I refuse to bite the hand that has\r\nfed me. I praise that actor's performance. I can only recall one\r\ninstance of my departing from my principles. That was when the\r\nchampagne was corked, and the man refused to buy me another bottle.\r\n\r\nAs is only natural, I have met many interesting people since I\r\nembarked on my career. I remember once lunching with rare Ben Jonson\r\nat the Mermaid Tavern--this would be back in Queen Elizabeth's time,\r\nwhen I was beginning to be known in the theatrical world--and seeing a\r\nyoung man with a nobby forehead and about three inches of beard doing\r\nhimself well at a neighboring table at the expense of Burbage the\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n\"Ben,\" I asked my companion, \"who is that youth?\" He told me that the\r\nfellow was one Bacon, a new dramatist who had learned his technique by\r\nholding horses' heads in the Strand, and who, for some reason or\r\nother, wrote under the name of Shakespeare. \"You must see his\r\n_Hamlet_,\" said Ben enthusiastically. \"He read me the script last\r\nnight. They start rehearsals at the Globe next week. It's a pippin. In\r\nthe last act every blamed character in the cast who isn't already dead\r\njumps on everyone else's neck and slays him. It's a skit, you know, on\r\nthese foolish tragedies which every manager is putting on just now.\r\nPersonally, I think it's the best thing since _The Prune-Hater's\r\nDaughter_.\"\r\n\r\nI was skeptical at the moment, but time proved the correctness of my\r\nold friend's judgment; and, having been present after the opening\r\nperformance at a little supper given by Burbage at which sack ran like\r\nwater, and anybody who wanted another malvoisie and seltzer simply had\r\nto beckon to the waiter, I was able to conscientiously praise it in\r\nthe highest terms.\r\n\r\nI still treasure the faded newspaper clipping which contains the\r\nadvertisement of the play, with the legend, \"Shakespeare has put one\r\nover. A scream from start to finish.\"--Wodehouse, in _The Weekly\r\nBear-Baiter_ (with which is incorporated _The Scurvy Knaves'\r\nGazette_).\r\n\r\nThe lot of a dramatic critic is, in many respects, an enviable one.\r\nLately, there has been the growing practice among critics of roasting\r\na play on the morning after production, and then having another go at\r\nit in the Sunday edition under the title of \"Second Swats\" or \"The\r\nPast Week in the Theatre,\" which has made it pretty rocky going for\r\ndramatists who thus get it twice in the same place, and experience the\r\ncomplex emotions of the commuter who, coming home in the dark, trips\r\nover the baby's cart and bumps his head against the hat stand.\r\n\r\nThere is also no purer pleasure than that of getting into a theatre on\r\nwhat the poet Milton used to call \"the nod.\" I remember Brigham Young\r\nsaying to me once with not unnatural chagrin, \"You're a lucky man,\r\nWodehouse. It doesn't cost you a nickel to go to a theatre. When I\r\nwant to take in a show with the wife, I have to buy up the whole of\r\nthe orchestra floor. And even then it's a tight fit.\"\r\n\r\nMy fellow critics and I escape this financial trouble, and it gives us\r\na good deal of pleasure, when the male star is counting the house over\r\nthe heroine's head (during their big love scene) to see him frown as\r\nhe catches sight of us and hastily revise his original estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGONIES OF WRITING A MUSICAL COMEDY\r\n\r\nWhich Shows Why Librettists Pick at the Coverlet\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trouble about musical comedy, and the reason why a great many\r\notherwise kindly and broadminded persons lie in wait round the corner\r\nwith sudden scowls, their whole being intent on beating it with a\r\nbrick the moment it shows its head, is that, from outside, it looks\r\ntoo easy.\r\n\r\nYou come into the crowded theatre and consider that each occupant of\r\nan orchestra chair is contributing three or four cents to the upkeep\r\nof a fellow who did nothing but dash off the stuff that keeps the\r\nnumbers apart, and your blood boils. A glow of honest resentment fills\r\nyou at the thought of anyone having such an absolute snap. You little\r\nknow what the poor bird has suffered, and how inadequate a reward are\r\nhis few yens per week for what he has been through. Musical comedy is\r\nnot dashed off. It grows--slowly and painfully, and each step in its\r\ngrowth either bleaches another tuft of the author's hair or removes it\r\nfrom the parent skull altogether.\r\n\r\nThe average musical comedy comes into being because somebody--not the\r\npublic, but a manager--wants one. We will say that Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWhoosis, the eminent ballroom dancers, have decided that they require\r\na different sphere for the exhibition of their talents. They do not\r\ndemand a drama. They commission somebody to write them a musical\r\ncomedy. Some poor, misguided creature is wheedled into signing a\r\ncontract: and, from that moment, his troubles begin.\r\n\r\nAn inspiration gives him a pleasing and ingenious plot. Full of\r\noptimism, he starts to write it. By the time he has finished an\r\nexcellent first act, he is informed that Mr. and Mrs. Whoosis propose\r\nto sing three solos and two duets in the first act and five in the\r\nsecond, and will he kindly build his script accordingly? This baffles\r\nthe author a little. He is aware that both artistes, though extremely\r\ngifted northward as far as the ankle-bone, go all to pieces above that\r\nlevel, with the result that by the time you reach the zone where the\r\nbrains and voice are located, there is nothing stirring whatever. And\r\nhe had allowed for this in his original conception of the play, by\r\nmaking Mrs. Whoosis a deaf-mute and Mr. Whoosis a Trappist monk under\r\nthe perpetual vow of silence. The unfolding of the plot he had left to\r\nthe other characters, with a few ingenious gaps where the two stars\r\ncould come on and dance.\r\n\r\nHe takes a stiff bracer, ties a vinegar-soaked handkerchief round his\r\nforehead, and sets to work to remodel his piece. He is a trifle\r\ndiscouraged, but he perseveres. With almost superhuman toil he\r\ncontrives the only possible story which will fit the necessities of\r\nthe case. He has wrapped up the script and is about to stroll round\r\nthe corner to mail it, when he learns from the manager who is acting\r\nas intermediary between the parties concerned in the production that\r\nthere is a slight hitch. Instead of having fifty thousand dollars\r\ndeposited in the bank to back the play, it seems that the artistes\r\nmerely said in their conversation that it would be awfully jolly if\r\nthey _did_ have that sum, or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nBy this time our author has got the thing into his system: or, rather,\r\nhe has worked so hard that he feels he cannot abandon the venture now.\r\nHe hunts for another manager who wants something musical, and at\r\nlength finds one. The only proviso is that this manager does not need\r\na piece built around two stars, but one suited to the needs of Jasper\r\nCutup, the well-known comedian, whom he has under contract. The\r\npersonality of Jasper is familiar to the author, so he works for a\r\nmonth or two and remoulds the play to fit him. With the script under\r\nhis arm he staggers to the manager's office. The manager reads the\r\nscript--smiles--chuckles--thoroughly enjoys it. Then a cloud passes\r\nathwart his brow. \"There's only one thing the matter with this piece,\"\r\nhe says. \"You seem to have written it to star a comedian.\" \"But you\r\nsaid you wanted it for Jasper Cutup,\" gasps the author, supporting\r\nhimself against the water-cooler. \"Well, yes, that is so,\" replies the\r\nmanager. \"I remember I did want a piece for him then, but he's gone\r\nand signed up with K. and Lee. What I wish you would do is to take\r\nthis script and twist it to be a vehicle for Pansy Glucose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pansy Glucose?\" moans the author. \"The ingenue?\" \"Yes,\" says the\r\nmanager. \"It won't take long. Just turn your Milwaukee pickle\r\nmanufacturer into a debutante, and the thing is done. Get to work as\r\nsoon as you can. I want this rushed.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is but a portion of the musical comedy author's troubles. We\r\nwill assume that he eventually finds a manager who really does put the\r\npiece into rehearsal. We will even assume that he encounters none of\r\nthe trials to which I have alluded. We will even go further and assume\r\nthat he is commissioned to write a musical comedy without any definite\r\nstellar personality in mind, and that when he has finished it the\r\nmanager will do his share by providing a suitable cast. Is he in soft?\r\nNo, dear reader, he is not in soft. You have forgotten the \"Gurls.\"\r\nCritics are inclined to reproach, deride, blame and generally hammer\r\nthe author of a musical comedy because his plot is not so consecutive\r\nand unbroken as the plot of a farce or a comedy. They do not realize\r\nthe conditions under which he is working. It is one of the immutable\r\nlaws governing musical plays that at certain intervals during the\r\nevening the audience demand to see the chorus. They may not be aware\r\nthat they so demand, but it is nevertheless a fact that, unless the\r\nchorus come on at these fixed intervals, the audience's interest sags.\r\nThe raciest farce-scenes cannot hold them, nor the most tender love\r\npassages. They want the gurls, the whole gurls, and nothing but the\r\ngurls.\r\n\r\nThus it comes about that the author, having at last finished his first\r\nact, is roused from his dream of content by a horrid fear. He turns to\r\nthe script, and discovers that his panic was well grounded. He has\r\ncarelessly allowed fully twenty pages to pass without once bringing on\r\nthe chorus.\r\n\r\nThis is where he begins to clutch his forehead and to grow gray at the\r\ntemples. He cannot possibly shift musical number four, which is a\r\nchorus number, into the spot now occupied by musical number three,\r\nwhich is a duet, because three is a \"situation\" number, rooted to its\r\nplace by the exigencies of the story. The only thing to do is to pull\r\nthe act to pieces and start afresh. And when you consider that this\r\nsort of thing happens not once but a dozen times between the start of\r\na musical comedy book and its completion, can you wonder that this\r\nbranch of writing is included among the dangerous trades and that\r\nlibrettists always end by picking at the coverlet?\r\n\r\nThen there is the question of cast. The author builds his hero in such\r\na manner that he requires an actor who can sing, dance, be funny, and\r\ncarry a love interest. When the time comes to cast the piece, he finds\r\nthat the only possible man in sight wants fifteen hundred a week and,\r\nanyway, is signed up for the next five years with the rival syndicate.\r\nHe is then faced with the alternative of revising his play to suit\r\neither: a) Jones, who can sing and dance, but is not funny; b) Smith,\r\nwho is funny, but cannot sing and dance; c) Brown, who is funny and\r\ncan sing and dance, but who cannot carry a love-interest and, through\r\nworking in revue, has developed a habit of wandering down to the\r\nfootlights and chatting with the audience. Whichever actor is given\r\nthe job, it means more rewriting.\r\n\r\nOvercome this difficulty, and another arises. Certain scenes are\r\nconstructed so that A gets a laugh at the expense of B; but B is a\r\nfive-hundred-a-week comedian and A is a two-hundred-a-week juvenile,\r\nand B refuses to \"play straight\" even for an instant for a social\r\ninferior. The original line is such that it cannot be simply switched\r\nfrom one to the other. The scene has to be entirely reconstructed and\r\nfurther laugh lines thought of. Multiply this by a hundred, and you\r\nwill begin to understand why, when you see a librettist, he is\r\ngenerally lying on his back on the sidewalk with a crowd standing\r\nround, saying, \"Give him air.\"\r\n\r\nSo, do not grudge the librettist his thousand a week or whatever it\r\nis. Remember what he has suffered and consider his emotions on the\r\nmorning after the production when he sees lines which he invented at\r\nthe cost of permanently straining his brain, attributed by the critics\r\nto the impromptu invention of the leading comedian. Of all the saddest\r\nwords of tongue or pen, the saddest--to a musical comedy author--are\r\nthese in the morning paper: \"The bulk of the humor was sustained by\r\nWalter Wiffle, who gagged his way merrily through the piece.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE WRITING OF LYRICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe musical comedy lyric is an interesting survival of the days, long\r\nsince departed, when poets worked. As everyone knows, the only real\r\nobstacle in the way of turning out poetry by the mile was the fact\r\nthat you had to make the darned stuff rhyme.\r\n\r\nMany lyricists rhyme as they pronounce, and their pronunciation is\r\nsimply horrible. They can make \"home\" rhyme with \"alone,\" and \"saw\"\r\nwith \"more,\" and go right off and look their innocent children in the\r\neye without a touch of shame.\r\n\r\nBut let us not blame the erring lyricist too much. It isn't his fault\r\nthat he does these things. It is the fault of the English language.\r\nWhoever invented the English language must have been a prose-writer,\r\nnot a versifier; for he has made meagre provision for the poets.\r\nIndeed, the word \"you\" is almost the only decent chance he has given\r\nthem. You can do something with a word like \"you.\" It rhymes with\r\n\"sue,\" \"eyes of blue,\" \"woo,\" and all sorts of succulent things,\r\neasily fitted into the fabric of a lyric. And it has the enormous\r\nadvantage that it can be repeated thrice at the end of a refrain when\r\nthe composer has given you those three long notes, which is about all\r\na composer ever thinks of. When a composer hands a lyricist a \"dummy\"\r\nfor a song, ending thus,\r\n\r\n    Tiddley-tum, tiddley-tum,\r\n           Pom-pom-pom, pom-pom-pom,\r\n                 Tum, tum, tum,\r\n\r\nthe lyricist just shoves down \"You, you, you\" for the last line, and\r\nthen sets to work to fit the rest of the words to it. I have dwelled\r\non this, for it is noteworthy as the only bright spot in a lyricist's\r\nlife, the only real cinch the poor man has.\r\n\r\nBut take the word \"love.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the board of directors, or whoever it was, was arranging the\r\nlanguage, you would have thought that, if they had had a spark of pity\r\nin their systems, they would have tacked on to that emotion of\r\nthoughts of which the young man's fancy lightly turns in spring, some\r\nword ending in an open vowel. They must have known that lyricists\r\nwould want to use whatever word they selected as a label for the\r\nabove-mentioned emotion far more frequently than any other word in the\r\nlanguage. It wasn't much to ask of them to choose a word capable of\r\nnumerous rhymes. But no, they went and made it \"love,\" causing vast\r\nmisery to millions.\r\n\r\n\"Love\" rhymes with \"dove,\" \"glove,\" \"above,\" and \"shove.\" It is true\r\nthat poets who print their stuff instead of having it sung take a mean\r\nadvantage by ringing in words like \"prove\" and \"move\"; but the\r\nlyricist is not allowed to do that. This is the wretched unfairness of\r\nthe lyricist's lot. The language gets him both ways. It won't let him\r\nrhyme \"love\" with \"move,\" and it won't let him rhyme \"maternal\" with\r\n\"colonel.\" If he tries the first course, he is told that the rhyme,\r\nthough all right for the eye, is wrong for the ear. If he tries the\r\nsecond course, they say that the rhyme, though more or less\r\nninety-nine percent pure for the ear, falls short when tested by the\r\neye. And, when he is driven back on one of the regular, guaranteed\r\nrhymes, he is taunted with triteness of phrase.\r\n\r\nNo lyricist wants to keep linking \"love\" with \"skies above\" and\r\n\"turtle dove,\" but what can he do? You can't do a thing with \"shove\";\r\nand \"glove\" is one of those aloof words which are not good mixers.\r\nAnd--mark the brutality of the thing--there is no word you can\r\nsubstitute for \"love.\" It is just as if they did it on purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Home\" is another example. It is the lyricist's staff of life. But all\r\nhe can do is to roam across the foam, if he wants to use it. He can\r\nput in \"Nome,\" of course, as a pinch-hitter in special crises, but\r\nvery seldom; with the result that his poetic soul, straining at its\r\nbonds, goes and uses \"alone,\" \"bone,\" \"tone,\" and \"thrown,\" exciting\r\nhoots of derision.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the paucity of rhymes that sours the lyricist's\r\nlife. He is restricted in his use of material, as well. If every\r\naudience to which a musical comedy is destined to play were a\r\nmetropolitan audience, all might be well; but there is the \"road\" to\r\nconsider. And even a metropolitan audience likes its lyrics as much as\r\npossible in the language of everyday. That is one of the thousand\r\nreasons why new Gilberts do not arise. Gilbert had the advantage of\r\nbeing a genius, but he had the additional advantage of writing for a\r\npublic which permitted him to use his full vocabulary, and even to\r\ndrop into foreign languages, even Latin and a little Greek when he\r\nfelt like it. (I allude to that song in \"The Grand Duke.\")\r\n\r\nAnd yet the modern lyricist, to look on the bright side, has\r\nadvantages that Gilbert never had. Gilbert never realised the\r\npossibilities of Hawaii, with its admirably named beaches, shores, and\r\nmusical instruments. Hawaii--capable as it is of being rhymed with\r\n\"higher\"--has done much to sweeten the lot--and increase the annual\r\nincome of an industrious and highly respectable but down-trodden class\r\nof the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAST THEATRICAL SEASON\r\n\r\nAnd the Six Best Performances\r\nby Unstarred Actors\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat lessons do we draw from the past theatrical season?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the success of _The Wanderer_ proves that the\r\nday of the small and intimate production is over and that what the\r\npublic wants is the large spectacle. In the second place, the success\r\nof _Oh, Boy!_--(I hate to refer to it, as I am one of the trio\r\nwho perpetrated it; but, honestly, we're simply turning them away in\r\ndroves, and Rockefeller has to touch Morgan for a bit if he wants to\r\nbuy a ticket from the speculators)--proves that the day of the large\r\nspectacle is over and that what the public wants is the small and\r\nintimate production.\r\n\r\nThen, the capacity business done by _The Thirteenth Chair_ shows\r\nclearly that what the proletariat demands nowadays, is the plotty\r\npiece and that the sun of the bright dialogue comedy has set; while\r\nthe capacity business done by _A Successful Calamity_ shows\r\nclearly that the number of the plotty piece is up.\r\n\r\nYou will all feel better and more able to enjoy yourselves now that a\r\ntrained critical mind has put you right on this subtle point.\r\n\r\nNo review of a theatrical season would be complete without a tabulated\r\nlist--or even an untabulated one--of the six best performances by\r\nunstarred actors during the past season.\r\n\r\nThe present past season--that is to say, the past season which at\r\npresent is the last season--has been peculiarly rich in hot efforts by\r\nall sorts of performers. My own choice would be: 1. Anna Wheaton, in\r\n_Oh, Boy!_ 2. Marie Carroll, in the piece at the Princess\r\nTheatre. 3. Edna May Oliver, in Comstock and Elliott's new musical\r\ncomedy. 4. Tom Powers, in the show on the south side of 39th Street.\r\n5. Hal Forde, in the successor to _Very Good, Eddie_. 6. Stephen\r\nMaley, in _Oh, Boy!_\r\n\r\nYou would hardly credit the agony it gives me to allude, even in\r\npassing, to the above musical mélange, but one must be honest to one's\r\npublic. In case there may be any who dissent from my opinion, I append\r\na supplementary list of those entitled to honorable mention: 1. The\r\nthird sheep from the O. P. side in _The Wanderer_. 2. The trick\r\nlamp in _Magic_. 3. The pink pajamas in _You're in Love_. 4.\r\nThe knife in _The Thirteenth Chair_. 5. The Confused Noise\r\nWithout in _The Great Divide_. 6. Jack Merritt's hair in _Oh,\r\nBoy!_\r\n\r\nThere were few discoveries among the dramatists. Of the older\r\nplaywrights, Barrie produced a new one and an ancient one, but the\r\nShakespeare boom, so strong last year, petered out. There seems no\r\ndoubt that the man, in spite of a flashy start, had not the stuff. I\r\nunderstand that some of his things are doing fairly well on the road.\r\nClare Kummer, whose \"Dearie\" I have so frequently sung in my bath, to\r\nthe annoyance of all, suddenly turned right round, dropped\r\nsong-writing, and ripped a couple of hot ones right over the plate.\r\nMr. Somerset Maugham succeeded in shocking Broadway so that the\r\nsidewalks were filled with blushing ticket-speculators.\r\n\r\nMost of the critics have done good work during this season. As for\r\nmyself, I have guided the public mind in this magazine soundly and\r\nwith few errors. If it were not for the fact that nearly all the plays\r\nI praised died before my review appeared, while the ones I said would\r\nnot run a week are still packing them in, I could look back to a\r\nflawless season.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I have had a very pleasant theatrical season. The\r\nweather was uniformly fine on the nights when I went to the theatre. I\r\nwas particularly fortunate in having neighbors at most of the plays\r\nwho were not afflicted with coughs or a desire to explain the plot to\r\ntheir wives. I have shaken hands with A. L. Erlanger and been nodded\r\nto on the street by Lee Shubert. I have broadened my mind by travel on\r\nthe road with a theatrical company, with the result that, if you want\r\nto get me out of New York, you will have to use dynamite.\r\n\r\nTake it for all in all, a most satisfactory season, full of pregnant\r\npossibilities--and all that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMON AND PYTHIAS\r\nA Romance\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since Earth was first created,\r\n      Since Time began to fly,\r\n    No friends were e'er so mated,\r\n      So firm as JONES and I.\r\n    Since primal Man was fashioned\r\n      To people ice and stones,\r\n    No pair, I ween, had ever been\r\n      Such chums as I and JONES.\r\n\r\n    In fair and foulest weather,\r\n      Beginning when but boys,\r\n    We faced our woes together,\r\n      We shared each other's joys.\r\n    Together, sad or merry,\r\n      We acted hand in glove,\r\n    Until--'twas careless, very--\r\n      I chanced to fall in love.\r\n\r\n    The lady's points to touch on,\r\n      Her name was JULIA WHITE,\r\n    Her lineage high, her scutcheon\r\n      Untarnished; manners, bright;\r\n    Complexion, soft and creamy;\r\n      Her hair, of golden hue;\r\n    Her eyes, in aspect, dreamy,\r\n      In colour, greyish blue.\r\n\r\n    For her I sighed, I panted;\r\n      I saw her in my dreams;\r\n    I vowed, protested, ranted;\r\n      I sent her chocolate creams.\r\n    Until methought one morning\r\n      I seemed to hear a voice,\r\n    A still, small voice of warning.\r\n      \"Does JONES approve your choice?\"\r\n\r\n    To JONES of my affection\r\n      I spoke that very night.\r\n    If he had no objection,\r\n      I said I'd wed Miss WHITE.\r\n    I asked him for his blessing,\r\n      But, turning rather blue,\r\n    He said: \"It's most distressing,\r\n      But _I_ adore her, too.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Then, JONES,\" I answered, sobbing,\r\n      \"My wooing's at an end,\r\n    I couldn't think of robbing\r\n      My best, my only friend.\r\n    The notion makes me furious--\r\n      I'd much prefer to die.\"\r\n    \"Perhaps you'll think it curious,\"\r\n      Said JONES, \"but so should I.\"\r\n\r\n    Nor he nor I would falter\r\n      In our resolve one jot.\r\n    I bade him seek the altar,\r\n      He vowed that he would not.\r\n    \"She's yours, old fellow. Make her\r\n      As happy as you can.\"\r\n    \"Not so,\" said I, \"you take her--\r\n      You are the lucky man.\"\r\n\r\n    At length--the situation\r\n      Had lasted now a year--\r\n    I had an inspiration,\r\n      Which seemed to make things clear.\r\n    \"Supposing,\" I suggested,\r\n      \"We ask Miss WHITE to choose?\r\n    I should be interested\r\n      To hear her private views.\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps she has a preference--\r\n      I own it sounds absurd--\r\n    But I submit, with deference,\r\n      That she might well be heard.\r\n    In clear, commercial diction\r\n      The case in point we'll state,\r\n    Disclose the cause of friction,\r\n      And leave the rest to Fate.\"\r\n\r\n    We did, and on the morrow\r\n      The postman brought us news.\r\n    Miss WHITE expressed her sorrow\r\n      At having to refuse.\r\n    Of all her many reasons\r\n      This seemed to me the pith:\r\n    Six months before (or rather more)\r\n      She'd married Mr. SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAUNTED TRAM\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ghosts of The Towers, The Grange, The Court,\r\n       Ghosts of the Castle Keep.\r\n    Ghosts of the finicking, \"high-life\" sort\r\n       Are growing a trifle cheap.\r\n    But here is a spook of another stamp,\r\n       No thin, theatrical sham,\r\n    But a spectre who fears not dirt nor damp:\r\n       He rides on a London tram.\r\n\r\n    By the curious glance of a mortal eye\r\n       He is not seen.

He had then\r\ndestroyed two of my best plants, and was commencing on a third, with\r\nevery appearance of self-satisfaction. I threw two large brushes and a\r\nboot at him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, papa! They didn't hit him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear, they did not. The brushes missed him by several yards,\r\nand the boot smashed a fourth carnation. However, I was so fortunate\r\nas to attract his attention, and he left off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't think what makes him do it. I suppose it's bones. He's got\r\nbones buried all over the garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he does it again, you'll find that there will be a few more\r\nbones buried in the garden!\" said the colonel grimly; and he subsided\r\ninto his paper.\r\n\r\nSylvia loved the dog partly for its own sake, but principally for that\r\nof the giver, one Reginald Dallas, whom it had struck at an early\r\nperiod of their acquaintance that he and Miss Sylvia Reynolds were\r\nmade for one another. On communicating this discovery to Sylvia\r\nherself he had found that her views upon the subject were identical\r\nwith his own; and all would have gone well had it not been for a\r\nmelancholy accident.\r\n\r\nOne day while out shooting with the colonel, with whom he was doing\r\nhis best to ingratiate himself, with a view to obtaining his consent\r\nto the match, he had allowed his sporting instincts to carry him away\r\nto such a degree that, in sporting parlance, he wiped his eye badly.\r\nNow, the colonel prided himself with justice on his powers as a shot;\r\nbut on this particular day he had a touch of liver, which resulted in\r\nhis shooting over the birds, and under the birds, and on each side of\r\nthe birds, but very rarely at the birds. Dallas being in especially\r\ngood form, it was found, when the bag came to be counted, that, while\r\nhe had shot seventy brace, the colonel had only managed to secure five\r\nand a half!\r\n\r\nHis bad marksmanship destroyed the last remnant of his temper. He\r\nswore for half an hour in Hindustani, and for another half-hour in\r\nEnglish. After that he felt better. And when, at the end of dinner,\r\nSylvia came to him with the absurd request that she might marry Mr.\r\nReginald Dallas he did not have a fit, but merely signified in fairly\r\nmoderate terms his entire and absolute refusal to think of such a\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nThis had happened a month before, and the pug, which had changed hands\r\nin the earlier days of the friendship, still remained, at the imminent\r\nrisk of its life, to soothe Sylvia and madden her father.\r\n\r\nIt was generally felt that the way to find favour in the eyes of\r\nSylvia--which were a charming blue, and well worth finding favour\r\nin--was to show an intelligent and affectionate interest in her dog.\r\nThis was so up to a certain point; but no farther, for the mournful\r\nrecollection of Mr. Dallas prevented her from meeting their advances\r\nin quite the spirit they could have wished.\r\n\r\nHowever, they persevered, and scarcely a week went by in which Thomas\r\nwas not rescued from an artfully arranged horrible fate by somebody.\r\n\r\nBut all their energy was in reality wasted, for Sylvia remembered her\r\nfaithful Reggie, who corresponded vigorously every day, and refused to\r\nbe put off with worthless imitations. The lovesick swains, however,\r\ncould not be expected to know of this, and the rescuing of Tommy\r\nproceeded briskly, now one, now another, playing the rôle of hero.\r\n\r\nThe very day after the conversation above recorded had taken place a\r\nterrible tragedy occurred.\r\n\r\nThe colonel, returning from a poor day's shooting, observed through\r\nthe mist that was beginning to rise a small form busily engaged in\r\nexcavating in the precious carnation-bed. Slipping in a cartridge, he\r\nfired; and the skill which had deserted him during the day came back\r\nto him. There was a yelp; then silence. And Sylvia, rushing out from\r\nthe house, found the luckless Thomas breathing his last on a heap of\r\nuprooted carnations.\r\n\r\nThe news was not long in spreading. The cook told the postman, and the\r\npostman thoughtfully handed it on to the servants at the rest of the\r\nhouses on his round. By noon it was public property; and in the\r\nafternoon, at various times from two to five, nineteen young men were\r\nstruck, quite independently of one another, with a brilliant idea.\r\n\r\nThe results of this idea were apparent on the following day.\r\n\r\n\"Is this all?\" asked the colonel of the servant, as she brought in a\r\ncouple of letters at breakfast-time.\r\n\r\n\"There's a hamper for Miss Sylvia, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hamper, is there? Well, bring it in.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, there's several of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Several? How many are there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nineteen, sir,\" said Mary, restraining with some difficulty an\r\ninclination to giggle.\r\n\r\n\"Eh? What? Nineteen? Nonsense! Where are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've put them in the coachhouse for the present, sir. And if you\r\nplease, sir, cook says she thinks there's something alive in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. And John says he thinks it's dogs, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel uttered a sound that was almost a bark, and, followed by\r\nSylvia, rushed to the coachhouse. There, sure enough, as far as the\r\neye could reach, were the hampers; and, as they looked, a sound\r\nproceeded from one of them that was unmistakably the plaintive note of\r\na dog that has been shut up, and is getting tired of it.\r\n\r\nInstantly the other eighteen hampers joined in, until the whole\r\ncoachhouse rang with the noise.\r\n\r\nThe colonel subsided against a wall, and began to express himself\r\nsoftly in Hindustani.\r\n\r\n\"Poor dears!\" said Sylvia. \"How stuffy they must be feeling!\"\r\n\r\nShe ran to the house, and returned with a basin of water.\r\n\r\n\"Poor dears!\" she said again. \"You'll soon have something to drink.\"\r\n\r\nShe knelt down by the nearest hamper, and cut the cord that fastened\r\nit. A pug jumped out like a jack-in-the-box, and rushed to the water.\r\nSylvia continued her work of mercy, and by the time the colonel had\r\nrecovered sufficiently to be able to express his views in English,\r\neighteen more pugs had joined their companion.\r\n\r\n\"Get out, you brute!\" shouted the colonel, as a dog insinuated itself\r\nbetween his legs. \"Sylvia, put them back again this minute! You had no\r\nbusiness to let them out. Put them back!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't, papa. I can't catch them.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked helplessly from him to the seething mass of dogs, and back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Where's my gun?\" began the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Papa, don't! You couldn't be so cruel! They aren't doing any harm,\r\npoor things!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I knew who sent them----\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there's something to show. Yes; here's a visiting-card in\r\nthis hamper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose is it?\" bellowed the colonel through the din.\r\n\r\n\"J. D'Arcy Henderson, The Firs,\" read Sylvia, at the top of her voice.\r\n\r\n\"Young blackguard!\" bawled the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"I expect there's one in each of the hampers. Yes; here's another. W.\r\nK. Ross, The Elms.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel came across, and began to examine the hampers with his own\r\nhand. Each hamper contained a visiting-card, and each card bore the\r\nname of a neighbour. The colonel returned to the breakfast-room, and\r\nlaid the nineteen cards out in a row on the table.\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" he said, at last. \"Mr. Reginald Dallas does not seem to be\r\nrepresented.\"\r\n\r\nSylvia said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"No; he seems not to be represented. I did not give him credit for so\r\nmuch sense.\" Then he dropped the subject, and breakfast proceeded in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman met the colonel on his walk that morning.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, colonel!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning!\" said the colonel grimly.\r\n\r\n\"Er--colonel, I--er--suppose Miss Reynolds got that dog all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"To which dog do you refer?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a pug, you know. It ought to have arrived by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I am inclined to think it has. Had it any special\r\ncharacteristics?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think so. Just an ordinary pug.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, young man, if you will go to my coachhouse, you will find\r\nnineteen ordinary pugs; and if you would kindly select your beast, and\r\nshoot it, I should be much obliged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nineteen?\" said the other, in astonishment. \"Why, are you setting up\r\nas a dog-fancier in your old age, colonel?\"\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the colonel. He exploded.\r\n\r\n\"Old age! Confound your impudence! Dog-fancier! No, sir! I have not\r\nbecome a dog-fancier in what you are pleased to call my old age! But\r\nwhile there is no law to prevent a lot of dashed young puppies like\r\nyourself, sir--like yourself--sending your confounded pug-dogs to my\r\ndaughter, who ought to have known better than to have let them out of\r\ntheir dashed hampers, I have no defence.\r\n\r\n\"Dog-fancier! Gad! Unless those dogs are removed by this time\r\nto-morrow, sir, they will go straight to the Battersea Home, where I\r\ndevoutly trust they will poison them. Here are the cards of the other\r\ngentlemen who were kind enough to think that I might wish to set up\r\nfor a dog-fancier in my old age. Perhaps you will kindly return them\r\nto their owners, and tell them what I have just said.\" And he strode\r\noff, leaving the young man in a species of trance.\r\n\r\n\"Sylvia!\" said the colonel, on arriving home.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you still want to marry that Dallas fellow? Now, for Heaven's\r\nsake, don't start crying! Goodness knows I've been worried enough this\r\nmorning without that. Please answer a plain question in a fairly sane\r\nmanner. Do you, or do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do, papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you may. He's the furthest from being a fool of any of the young\r\npuppies who live about here, and he knows one end of a gun from the\r\nother. I'll write to him now.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Dallas\" (wrote the colonel),--\"I find, on consideration,\r\n    that you are the only sensible person in the neighbourhood. I hope\r\n    you will come to lunch to-day. And if you still want to marry\r\n    my daughter, you may.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Dallas replied by return of messenger:\r\n\r\n    \"Thanks for both invitations. I will.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later he arrived in person, and the course of true love pulled\r\nitself together, and began to run smooth again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM, DICK, AND HARRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story will interest and amuse all cricketers, and while from the\r\nmale point of view it may serve as a good illustration of the\r\nfickleness of woman and the impossibility of forecasting what course\r\nshe will take, the fair sex will find in it an equally shining proof\r\nof the colossal vanity of man.\r\n\r\n\"It's like this.\"\r\n\r\nTom Ellison sat down on the bed, and paused.\r\n\r\n\"Whack it out,\" said Dick Henley encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"We're all friends here, and the password's 'Portland.' What's the\r\nmatter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate talking to a man when he's shaving. I don't want to have you\r\ncutting your head off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about me. This is a safety razor. And, anyhow, what's the\r\nexcitement? Going to make my flesh creep?\"\r\n\r\nTom Ellison kicked uncomfortably at the chair he was trying to balance\r\non one leg.\r\n\r\n\"It's so hard to explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a dash at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, look here, Dick, we've always been pals. What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we have.\"\r\n\r\n\"We went to the Empire last Boatrace night together----\"\r\n\r\n\"And got chucked out simultaneously.\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact, we've always been pals. What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, whenever there was a rag on, and a bonner in the quad, you\r\nalways knew you could help yourself to my chairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had the run of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've shared each other's baccy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And whisky.\"\r\n\r\n\"In short, we've always been pals. What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Tom Ellison, \"what are you trying to cut me out for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut you out?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what I mean. What do you think I came here for? To play\r\ncricket? Rot! I'd much rather have gone on tour with the Authentics. I\r\ncame here to propose to Dolly Burn.\"\r\n\r\nDick Henley frowned.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd speak of her as Miss Burn,\" he said austerely.\r\n\r\n\"There you are, you see,\" said Tom with sombre triumph; \"you oughtn't\r\nto have noticed a thing like that. It oughtn't to matter to you what I\r\ncall her. I always think of her as Dolly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've no right to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten to one in anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done,\" said Tom. \"I mean,\" he added hastily, \"don't be a fool. There\r\nare some things one can't bet on. As you ought to have known,\" he said\r\nprimly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, look here,\" said Dick, \"this thing has got to be settled. You say\r\nI'm trying to cut you out. I like that! We may fairly describe that as\r\nrich. As if my love were the same sort of passing fancy that yours is.\r\nYou know you fall in love, as you call it, with every girl you meet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. If the subject is painful we won't discuss it. Still, how\r\nabout that girl you used to rave about last summer? Ethel Something?\"\r\n\r\nTom blushed.\r\n\r\n\"A mere platonic friendship. We both collected autographs. And, if it\r\ncomes to that, how about Dora Thingummy? You had enough to say about\r\nher last winter.\"\r\n\r\nDick reddened.\r\n\r\n\"We were on good terms. Nothing more. She always sliced with her\r\nbrassy. So did I. It formed a sort of bond.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" resumed Dick, \"I don't see the point of all this. Why\r\nrake up the past? You aren't writing my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You started raking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to drop that, what do you propose to do about this? You're a\r\ngood chap, Tom, when you aren't making an ass of yourself; but I'm\r\nhanged if I'm going to have you interfering between me and Dolly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Burn.\"\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Dick. \"Cards on the table. I've loved her since last\r\nCommem.\"\r\n\r\n\"So have I.\"\r\n\r\n\"We went up the Char together in a Canader. Alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"She also did the trip with me. No chaperone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twice with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same here.\"\r\n\r\n\"She gave me a couple of dances at the Oriel ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"So she did me. She said my dancing was so much better than the\r\naverage young man's.\"\r\n\r\n\"She told me I must have had a great deal of practice at waltzing.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of photographs,\" said Tom, \"she gave me one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean 'also' or 'a brace'?\" inquired Tom anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"'Also,'\" confessed Dick with reluctance.\r\n\r\n\"Signed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather!\"\r\n\r\nA third pause.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is,\" said Tom; \"we must agree on something, or we\r\nshall both get left. All we're doing now is to confuse the poor girl.\r\nShe evidently likes us both the same. What I mean is, we're both so\r\nalike that she can't possibly make a choice unless one of us chucks\r\nit. You don't feel like chucking it, Dick. What?\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be more of an idiot than you can help.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only asked. So we are evidently both determined to stick to it. We\r\nshall have to toss, then, to settle which is to back out and give the\r\nother man a show.\"\r\n\r\n\"Toss!\" shouted Dick. \"For Dolly! Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"But we must do something. You won't back out like a sensible man. We\r\nmust settle it somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" said Dick. \"I've got it. We both seem to have come\r\nhere and let ourselves in for this rotten little village match, on a\r\nwicket which will probably be all holes and hillocks, simply for\r\nDolly's sake. So it's only right that we should let the match decide\r\nthis thing for us. It won't be so cold-blooded as tossing. See?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whichever of us makes the bigger score today wins. The loser has to\r\nkeep absolutely off the grass. Not so much as a look or a remark about\r\nthe weather. Then, of course, after the winner has had his innings, if\r\nhe hasn't brought the thing off, and she has chucked him, the loser\r\ncan have a look in. But not a moment before. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll give an interest to a rotten match,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\nTom rose to a point of order.\r\n\r\n\"There's one objection. You, being a stodgy sort of bat, and having a\r\nhabit of sitting on the splice, always get put in first. I'm a hitter,\r\nso they generally shove me in about fourth wicket. In this sort of\r\nmatch the man who goes in fourth wicket is likely to be not out half a\r\ndozen at the end of the innings. Nobody stays in more than three\r\nballs. Whereas you, going in first, will have time for a decent knock\r\nbefore the rot starts. Follow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to take any advantage of you,\" said Dick\r\ncondescendingly. \"I shan't need it. We'll see Drew after breakfast and\r\nget him to put us both in first.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Henry Drew, cricketing curate, was the captain of the side.\r\n\r\nConsulted on the matter after breakfast, the Rev. Henry looked grave.\r\nHe was taking this match very seriously, and held decided views on the\r\nsubject of managing his team.\r\n\r\n\"The point is, my dear Ellison,\" he said, \"that I want the bowling\r\nbroken a bit before you go in. Then your free, aggressive style would\r\nhave a better chance. I was thinking of putting you in fourth wicket.\r\nWould not that suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. Tell him, Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Drew,\" said Dick; \"you'll regard what I'm going to say as\r\nsaid under seal of the confessional and that sort of thing, won't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall, of course, respect any confidence you impart to me, my dear\r\nHenley. What is this dreadful secret?\"\r\n\r\nDick explained.\r\n\r\n\"So you see,\" he concluded, \"it's absolutely necessary that we should\r\nstart fair.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Henry looked as disturbed as if he had suddenly detected\r\nsymptoms of Pelagianism in a member of his Sunday-school class.\r\n\r\n\"Is such a contest quite----? Is it not a little--um?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Dick, hastening to justify himself and friend. \"We\r\nmust settle the thing somehow, and neither of us will back out. If we\r\ndidn't do this we should have to toss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid!\" said the curate, shocked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, is it a deal? Will you put us in first?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Good of you,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of country cricket. There is the variety you get\r\nat a country-house, where the wicket is prepared with a care as\r\nmeticulous as that in fashion on any county ground; where red marl and\r\nsuch-like aids to smoothness have been injected into the turf all\r\nthrough the winter; and where the out-fielding is good and the\r\nboundaries spacious. And there is the village match, where cows are\r\napt to stroll on to the pitch before the innings and cover-point\r\nstands up to his neck in a furze-bush.\r\n\r\nThe game which was to decide the fate of Tom and Dick belonged to the\r\nlatter variety. A pitch had been mown in the middle of a meadow\r\n(kindly lent by Farmer Rollitt on condition that he should be allowed\r\nto umpire, and his eldest son Ted put on to bowl first). The team\r\nconsisted of certain horny-handed sons of toil, with terrific\r\ngolf-shots in the direction of square-leg, and the enemy's ranks were\r\ncomposed of the same material. Tom and Dick, in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, would have gone in to bat in such a match with a\r\nfeeling of lofty disdain, as befitting experts from the civilised\r\nworld, come to teach the rustic mind what was what.\r\n\r\nBut on the present occasion the thought of all that depended on their\r\nbats induced a state of nerves which would have done credit to a test\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind taking first b-b-ball, old man?\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"All r-right,\" said Dick. He had been on the point of making the\r\nrequest himself, but it would not do to let Tom see that he was\r\nnervous.\r\n\r\nHe took guard from Farmer Rollitt, and settled himself into position\r\nto face the first delivery.\r\n\r\nWhether it is due to the pure air of the country or to daily manual\r\ntoil is not known, but the fact remains that bowlers in village\r\nmatches, whatever their other shortcomings, seldom fall short in the\r\nmatter of speed. The present trundler, having swung his arm round like\r\na flail, bounded to the crease and sent down a ball which hummed in\r\nthe air. It pitched halfway between the wickets in a slight hollow\r\ncaused by the foot of a cow and shot. Dick reached blindly forward,\r\nand the next moment his off-stump was out of the ground.\r\n\r\nA howl of approval went up from the supporters of the enemy, lying\r\nunder the trees.\r\n\r\nTom sat down, limp with joy. Dick out for a duck! What incredible good\r\nfortune! He began to frame in his mind epigrammatic sentences for use\r\nin the scene which would so shortly take place between Miss Dolly Burn\r\nand himself. The next man came in and played flukily but successfully\r\nthrough the rest of the over. \"Just a single,\" said Tom to himself as\r\nhe faced the bowler at the other end. \"Just one solitary single. Miss\r\nBurn--may I call you Dolly? Do you remember that moonlight night? On\r\nthe Char? In my Canadian canoe? We two?\"\r\n\r\n\"'S THAT?\" shrieked bowler and wicket-keeper as one man.\r\n\r\nTom looked blankly at them. He had not gone within a mile and a half\r\nof the ball, he was certain. And yet--there was the umpire with his\r\nhand raised, as if he were the Pope bestowing a blessing.\r\n\r\nHe walked quickly back to the trees, flung off his pads, and began to\r\nsmoke furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said a voice.\r\n\r\nDick was standing before him, grinning like a gargoyle.\r\n\r\n\"Of all the absolutely delirious decisions----\" began Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Dick rudely, \"I know all about that. Why, I could hear\r\nthe click from where I was sitting. The point is, what's to be done\r\nnow? We shall have to settle it on the second innings.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there is one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there'll be a second innings all right. There's another man out.\r\nOn a wicket like this we shall all be out in an hour, and we'll have\r\nthe other side out in another hour, and then we'll start again on this\r\nbusiness. I shall play a big game next innings. It was only that\r\ninfernal ball shooting that did me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Tom; \"if the umpire has got over his fit of delirium\r\ntremens, or been removed to Colney Hatch, shall almost certainly make\r\na century.\"\r\n\r\nIt was four o'clock by the time Tom and Dick went to the wickets for\r\nthe second time. Their side had been headed by their opponents by a\r\ndozen on the first innings--68 to 56.\r\n\r\nA splendid spirit of confidence animated the two batsmen. The umpire\r\nwho had effected Tom's downfall in the first innings had since\r\nreceived a hard drive in the small of the back as he turned coyly away\r\nto avoid the ball, and was now being massaged by strong men in the\r\ntaproom of the village inn. It was the sort of occurrence, said Tom,\r\nwhich proved once and for all the existence of an all-seeing,\r\nbenevolent Providence.\r\n\r\nAs for Dick, he had smoothed out a few of the more important\r\nmountain-ranges which marred the smoothness of the wicket, and was\r\nfeeling that all was right with the world.\r\n\r\nThe pair started well. The demon bowler of the enemy, having been\r\nfêted considerably under the trees by enthusiastic admirers during the\r\ninnings of his side, was a little incoherent in his deliveries. Four\r\nfull-pitches did he send down to Dick in his first over, and Dick had\r\nplaced 16 to his credit before Tom, who had had to look on anxiously,\r\nhad opened his account. Dick was a slow scorer as a rule, but he knew\r\na full-pitch to leg when he saw one.\r\n\r\nFrom his place at the other crease Tom could see Miss Burn and her\r\nmother sitting under the trees, watching the game.\r\n\r\nThe sight nerved him. By the time he had played through his first over\r\nhe had reduced Dick's lead by half. An oyster would have hit out in\r\nsuch circumstances, and Tom was always an aggressive batsman. By the\r\nend of the third over the scores were level. Each had made 20.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm ran high amongst the spectators, or such of them as were\r\nnatives of the village. Such a stand for the first wicket had not been\r\nseen in all the matches ever played in the neighbourhood. When Tom,\r\nwith a nice straight drive (which should have been a 4, but was\r\nstopped by a cow and turned into a single), brought up the century,\r\nsmall boys burst buttons and octogenarians wept like babes.\r\n\r\nThe bowling was collared. The demon had long since retired grumbling\r\nto the deep field. Weird trundlers, with actions like nothing else on\r\nearth, had been tried, had fired their ringing shot, and passed. One\r\nindividual had gone on with lobs, to the acute delight of everybody\r\nexcept the fieldsmen who had to retrieve the balls and the\r\nabove-mentioned cow. And still Tom and Dick stayed in and smote, while\r\nin the west the sun slowly sank.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Henry looked anxious. It was magnificent, but it must not be\r\noverdone. A little more and they would not have time to get the foe\r\nout for the second time. In which case the latter would win on the\r\nfirst innings. And this thought was as gall to him.\r\n\r\nHe walked out and addressed the rival captain.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said he, \"we will close our innings.\"\r\n\r\nTom and Dick made two bee-lines for the scorer and waited\r\npalpitatingly for the verdict.\r\n\r\n\"What's my score?\" panted Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty-fower, sur.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine?\" gasped Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty-fower, too, sur.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You see, my dear fellows,\" said the Rev. Henry when they had\r\nfinished--and his voice was like unto oil that is poured into a\r\nwound--\"we had to win this match, and if you had gone on batting we\r\nshould not have had time to get them out. As it is, we shall have to\r\nhurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, hang it----\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"But, look here----\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth are we to do?\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"We're in precisely the same hole as we were before,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know how to manage it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're absolutely bunkered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our competition, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"About Miss Burn, don't you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is to propose first?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't settle it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Henry smiled a faint, saintly smile and raised a protesting\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"My advice,\" he said, \"is that both of you should refrain from\r\nproposing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"_Wha-at_?\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" purred the Rev. Henry, \"you are both very young fellows.\r\nProbably you do not know your own minds. You take these things too\r\nseri----\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, look here,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"None of that rot,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"I shall propose tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall propose this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't,\" said the Rev. Henry. \"The fact is----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't tell you before, for fear it should put you off your game;\r\nbut Miss Burn is engaged already, and has been for three days.\"\r\n\r\nThe two rivals started.\r\n\r\n\"Engaged!\" cried Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Whom to?\" hissed Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Me,\" murmured Harry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEEVES TAKES CHARGE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, touching this business of old Jeeves--my man, you know--how do we\r\nstand? Lots of people think I'm much too dependent on him. My Aunt\r\nAgatha, in fact, has even gone so far as to call him my keeper. Well,\r\nwhat I say is: Why not? The man's a genius. From the collar upward he\r\nstands alone. I gave up trying to run my own affairs within a week of\r\nhis coming to me. That was about half a dozen years ago, directly\r\nafter the rather rummy business of Florence Craye, my Uncle\r\nWilloughby's book, and Edwin, the Boy Scout.\r\n\r\nThe thing really began when I got back to Easeby, my uncle's place in\r\nShropshire. I was spending a week or so there, as I generally did in\r\nthe summer; and I had had to break my visit to come back to London to\r\nget a new valet. I had found Meadowes, the fellow I had taken to\r\nEaseby with me, sneaking my silk socks, a thing no bloke of spirit\r\ncould stick at any price. It transpiring, moreover, that he had looted\r\na lot of other things here and there about the place, I was\r\nreluctantly compelled to hand the misguided blighter the mitten and go\r\nto London to ask the registry office to dig up another specimen for my\r\napproval. They sent me Jeeves.\r\n\r\nI shall always remember the morning he came. It so happened that the\r\nnight before I had been present at a rather cheery little supper, and\r\nI was feeling pretty rocky. On top of this I was trying to read a book\r\nFlorence Craye had given me. She had been one of the house-party at\r\nEaseby, and two or three days before I left we had got engaged. I was\r\ndue back at the end of the week, and I knew she would expect me to\r\nhave finished the book by then. You see, she was particularly keen on\r\nboosting me up a bit nearer her own plane of intellect. She was a girl\r\nwith a wonderful profile, but steeped to the gills in serious purpose.\r\nI can't give you a better idea of the way things stood than by telling\r\nyou that the book she'd given me to read was called \"Types of Ethical\r\nTheory,\" and that when I opened it at random I struck a page\r\nbeginning:--\r\n\r\n    _The postulate or common understanding involved in speech is\r\n    certainly co-extensive, in the obligation it carries, with the\r\n    social organism of which language is the instrument, and the\r\n    ends of which it is an effort to subserve._\r\n\r\nAll perfectly true, no doubt; but not the sort of thing to spring on a\r\nlad with a morning head.\r\n\r\nI was doing my best to skim through this bright little volume when the\r\nbell rang. I crawled off the sofa and opened the door. A kind of\r\ndarkish sort of respectful Johnnie stood without.\r\n\r\n\"I was sent by the agency, sir,\" he said. \"I was given to understand\r\nthat you required a valet.\"\r\n\r\nI'd have preferred an undertaker; but I told him to stagger in, and he\r\nfloated noiselessly through the doorway like a healing zephyr. That\r\nimpressed me from the start. Meadowes had had flat feet and used to\r\nclump. This fellow didn't seem to have any feet at all. He just\r\nstreamed in. He had a grave, sympathetic face, as if he, too, knew\r\nwhat it was to sup with the lads.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" he said gently.\r\n\r\nThen he seemed to flicker, and wasn't there any longer. I heard him\r\nmoving about in the kitchen, and presently he came back with a glass\r\non a tray.\r\n\r\n\"If you would drink this, sir,\" he said, with a kind of bedside\r\nmanner, rather like the royal doctor shooting the bracer into the sick\r\nprince. \"It is a little preparation of my own invention. It is the\r\nWorcester Sauce that gives it its colour. The raw egg makes it\r\nnutritious. The red pepper gives it its bite. Gentlemen have told me\r\nthey have found it extremely invigorating after a late evening.\"\r\n\r\nI would have clutched at anything that looked like a life-line that\r\nmorning. I swallowed the stuff. For a moment I felt as if somebody had\r\ntouched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling down my\r\nthroat with a lighted torch, and then everything seemed suddenly to\r\nget all right. The sun shone in through the window; birds twittered in\r\nthe tree-tops; and, generally speaking, hope dawned once more.\r\n\r\n\"You're engaged!\" I said, as soon as I could say anything.\r\n\r\nI perceived clearly that this cove was one of the world's wonders, the\r\nsort no home should be without.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir. My name is Jeeves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can start in at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Immediately, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I'm due down at Easeby, in Shropshire, the day after\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\" He looked past me at the mantelpiece. \"That is an\r\nexcellent likeness of Lady Florence Craye, sir. It is two years since\r\nI saw her ladyship. I was at one time in Lord Worplesdon's employment.\r\nI tendered my resignation because I could not see eye to eye with his\r\nlordship in his desire to dine in dress trousers, a flannel shirt, and\r\na shooting coat.\"\r\n\r\nHe couldn't tell me anything I didn't know about the old boy's\r\neccentricity. This Lord Worplesdon was Florence's father. He was the\r\nold buster who, a few years later, came down to breakfast one morning,\r\nlifted the first cover he saw, said \"Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Damn all eggs!\"\r\nin an overwrought sort of voice, and instantly legged it for France,\r\nnever to return to the bosom of his family. This, mind you, being a\r\nbit of luck for the bosom of the family, for old Worplesdon had the\r\nworst temper in the county.\r\n\r\nI had known the family ever since I was a kid, and from boyhood up\r\nthis old boy had put the fear of death into me. Time, the great\r\nhealer, could never remove from my memory the occasion when he found\r\nme--then a stripling of fifteen--smoking one of his special cigars in\r\nthe stables. He got after me with a hunting-crop just at the moment\r\nwhen I was beginning to realise that what I wanted most on earth was\r\nsolitude and repose, and chased me more than a mile across difficult\r\ncountry. If there was a flaw, so to speak, in the pure joy of being\r\nengaged to Florence, it was the fact that she rather took after her\r\nfather, and one was never certain when she might erupt. She had a\r\nwonderful profile, though.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Florence and I are engaged, Jeeves,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\r\n\r\nYou know, there was a kind of rummy something about his manner.\r\nPerfectly all right and all that, but not what you'd call chirpy. It\r\nsomehow gave me the impression that he wasn't keen on Florence. Well,\r\nof course, it wasn't my business. I supposed that while he had been\r\nvaleting old Worplesdon she must have trodden on his toes in some way.\r\nFlorence was a dear girl, and, seen sideways, most awfully\r\ngood-looking; but if she had a fault it was a tendency to be a bit\r\nimperious with the domestic staff.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the proceedings there was another ring at the front\r\ndoor. Jeeves shimmered out and came back with a telegram. I opened it.\r\nIt ran:\r\n\r\n    _Return immediately. Extremely urgent. Catch first train.\r\n    Florence._\r\n\r\n\"Rum!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing!\"\r\n\r\nIt shows how little I knew Jeeves in those days that I didn't go a bit\r\ndeeper into the matter with him. Nowadays I would never dream of\r\nreading a rummy communication without asking him what he thought of\r\nit. And this one was devilish odd. What I mean is, Florence knew I was\r\ngoing back to Easeby the day after to-morrow, anyway; so why the hurry\r\ncall? Something must have happened, of course; but I couldn't see what\r\non earth it could be.\r\n\r\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"we shall be going down to Easeby this afternoon.\r\nCan you manage it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can get your packing done and all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without any difficulty, sir. Which suit will you wear for the\r\njourney?\"\r\n\r\n\"This one.\"\r\n\r\nI had on a rather sprightly young check that morning, to which I was a\r\ngood deal attached; I fancied it, in fact, more than a little. It was\r\nperhaps rather sudden till you got used to it, but, nevertheless, an\r\nextremely sound effort, which many lads at the club and elsewhere had\r\nadmired unrestrainedly.\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was that kind of rummy something in his manner. It was the\r\nway he said it, don't you know. He didn't like the suit. I pulled\r\nmyself together to assert myself. Something seemed to tell me that,\r\nunless I was jolly careful and nipped this lad in the bud, he would be\r\nstarting to boss me. He had the aspect of a distinctly resolute\r\nblighter.\r\n\r\nWell, I wasn't going to have any of that sort of thing, by Jove! I'd\r\nseen so many cases of fellows who had become perfect slaves to their\r\nvalets. I remember poor old Aubrey Fothergill telling me--with\r\nabsolute tears in his eyes, poor chap!--one night at the club, that he\r\nhad been compelled to give up a favourite pair of brown shoes simply\r\nbecause Meekyn, his man, disapproved of them. You have to keep these\r\nfellows in their place, don't you know. You have to work the good old\r\niron-hand-in-the-velvet-glove wheeze. If you give them a\r\nwhat's-its-name, they take a thingummy.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you like this suit, Jeeves?\" I said coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what don't you like about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a very nice suit, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's wrong with it? Out with it, dash it!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I might make the suggestion, sir, a simple brown or blue, with a\r\nhint of some quiet twill----\"\r\n\r\n\"What absolute rot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly blithering, my dear man!\"\r\n\r\n\"As you say, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI felt as if I had stepped on the place where the last stair ought to\r\nhave been, but wasn't. I felt defiant, if you know what I mean, and\r\nthere didn't seem anything to defy.\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he went away to collect his kit, while I started in again on\r\n\"Types of Ethical Theory\" and took a stab at a chapter headed\r\n\"Idiopsychological Ethics.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost of the way down in the train that afternoon, I was wondering what\r\ncould be up at the other end. I simply couldn't see what could have\r\nhappened. Easeby wasn't one of those country houses you read about in\r\nthe society novels, where young girls are lured on to play baccarat\r\nand then skinned to the bone of their jewellery, and so on. The\r\nhouse-party I had left had consisted entirely of law-abiding birds\r\nlike myself.\r\n\r\nBesides, my uncle wouldn't have let anything of that kind go on in his\r\nhouse. He was a rather stiff, precise sort of old boy, who liked a\r\nquiet life. He was just finishing a history of the family or\r\nsomething, which he had been working on for the last year, and didn't\r\nstir much from the library. He was rather a good instance of what they\r\nsay about its being a good scheme for a fellow to sow his wild oats.\r\nI'd been told that in his youth Uncle Willoughby had been a bit of a\r\nrounder. You would never have thought it to look at him now.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the house, Oakshott, the butler, told me that Florence\r\nwas in her room, watching her maid pack. Apparently there was a dance\r\non at a house about twenty miles away that night, and she was motoring\r\nover with some of the Easeby lot and would be away some nights.\r\nOakshott said she had told him to tell her the moment I arrived; so I\r\ntrickled into the smoking-room and waited, and presently in she came.\r\nA glance showed me that she was perturbed, and even peeved. Her eyes\r\nhad a goggly look, and altogether she appeared considerably pipped.\r\n\"Darling!\" I said, and attempted the good old embrace; but she\r\nsidestepped like a bantam weight.\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything's the matter! Bertie, you remember asking me, when you\r\nleft, to make myself pleasant to your uncle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea being, of course, that as at that time I was more or less\r\ndependent on Uncle Willoughby I couldn't very well marry without his\r\napproval. And though I knew he wouldn't have any objection to\r\nFlorence, having known her father since they were at Oxford together,\r\nI hadn't wanted to take any chances; so I had told her to make an\r\neffort to fascinate the old boy.\r\n\r\n\"You told me it would please him particularly if I asked him to read\r\nme some of his history of the family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't he pleased?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was delighted. He finished writing the thing yesterday afternoon,\r\nand read me nearly all of it last night. I have never had such a shock\r\nin my life. The book is an outrage. It is impossible. It is horrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, dash it, the family weren't so bad as all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not a history of the family at all. Your uncle has written his\r\nreminiscences! He calls them 'Recollections of a Long Life'!\"\r\n\r\nI began to understand. As I say, Uncle Willoughby had been somewhat on\r\nthe tabasco side as a young man, and it began to look as if he might\r\nhave turned out something pretty fruity if he had started recollecting\r\nhis long life.\r\n\r\n\"If half of what he has written is true,\" said Florence, \"your uncle's\r\nyouth must have been perfectly appalling. The moment we began to read\r\nhe plunged straight into a most scandalous story of how he and my\r\nfather were thrown out of a music-hall in 1887!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I decline to tell you why.\"\r\n\r\nIt must have been something pretty bad. It took a lot to make them\r\nchuck people out of music-halls in 1887.\r\n\r\n\"Your uncle specifically states that father had drunk a quart and a\r\nhalf of champagne before beginning the evening,\" she went on. \"The\r\nbook is full of stories like that. There is a dreadful one about Lord\r\nEmsworth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Emsworth? Not the one we know? Not the one at Blandings?\"\r\n\r\nA most respectable old Johnnie, don't you know. Doesn't do a thing\r\nnowadays but dig in the garden with a spud.\r\n\r\n\"The very same. That is what makes the book so unspeakable. It is full\r\nof stories about people one knows who are the essence of propriety\r\ntoday, but who seem to have behaved, when they were in London in the\r\n'eighties, in a manner that would not have been tolerated in the\r\nfo'c'sle of a whaler. Your uncle seems to remember everything\r\ndisgraceful that happened to anybody when he was in his early\r\ntwenties. There is a story about Sir Stanley Gervase-Gervase at\r\nRosherville Gardens which is ghastly in its perfection of detail. It\r\nseems that Sir Stanley--but I can't tell you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a dash!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, I shouldn't worry. No publisher will print the book if it's\r\nas bad as all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, your uncle told me that all negotiations are settled\r\nwith Riggs and Ballinger, and he's sending off the manuscript tomorrow\r\nfor immediate publication. They make a special thing of that sort of\r\nbook. They published Lady Carnaby's 'Memories of Eighty Interesting\r\nYears.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I read 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, when I tell you that Lady Carnaby's Memories are simply\r\nnot to be compared with your uncle's Recollections, you will\r\nunderstand my state of mind. And father appears in nearly every story\r\nin the book! I am horrified at the things he did when he was a young\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"The manuscript must be intercepted before it reaches Riggs and\r\nBallinger, and destroyed!\"\r\n\r\nI sat up.\r\n\r\nThis sounded rather sporting.\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to do it?\" I enquired.\r\n\r\n\"How can I do it? Didn't I tell you the parcel goes off to-morrow? I\r\nam going to the Murgatroyds' dance to-night and shall not be back till\r\nMonday. You must do it. That is why I telegraphed to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\nShe gave me a look.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say you refuse to help me, Bertie?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but--I say!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quite simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"But even if I--What I mean is--Of course, anything I can do--but--if\r\nyou know what I mean----\"\r\n\r\n\"You say you want to marry me, Bertie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course; but still----\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment she looked exactly like her old father.\r\n\r\n\"I will never marry you if those Recollections are published.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Florence, old thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean it. You may look on it as a test, Bertie. If you have the\r\nresource and courage to carry this thing through, I will take it as\r\nevidence that you are not the vapid and shiftless person most people\r\nthink you. If you fail, I shall know that your Aunt Agatha was right\r\nwhen she called you a spineless invertebrate and advised me strongly\r\nnot to marry you. It will be perfectly simple for you to intercept the\r\nmanuscript, Bertie. It only requires a little resolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose Uncle Willoughby catches me at it? He'd cut me off with a\r\nbob.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you care more for your uncle's money than for me----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Rather not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then. The parcel containing the manuscript will, of\r\ncourse, be placed on the hall table to-morrow for Oakshott to take to\r\nthe village with the letters. All you have to do is to take it away\r\nand destroy it. Then your uncle will think it has been lost in the\r\npost.\"\r\n\r\nIt sounded thin to me.\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't he got a copy of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it has not been typed. He is sending the manuscript just as he\r\nwrote it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he could write it over again.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if he would have the energy!\"\r\n\r\n\"But----\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are going to do nothing but make absurd objections, Bertie----\"\r\n\r\n\"I was only pointing things out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't! Once and for all, will you do me this quite simple act\r\nof kindness?\"\r\n\r\nThe way she put it gave me an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Why not get Edwin to do it? Keep it in the family, kind of, don't you\r\nknow. Besides, it would be a boon to the kid.\"\r\n\r\nA jolly bright idea it seemed to me. Edwin was her young brother, who\r\nwas spending his holidays at Easeby. He was a ferret-faced kid, whom I\r\nhad disliked since birth. As a matter of fact, talking of\r\nRecollections and Memories, it was young blighted Edwin who, nine\r\nyears before, had led his father to where I was smoking his cigar and\r\ncaused all of the unpleasantness. He was fourteen now and had just\r\njoined the Boy Scouts. He was one of those thorough kids, and took his\r\nresponsibilities pretty seriously. He was always in a sort of fever\r\nbecause he was dropping behind schedule with his daily acts of\r\nkindness. However hard he tried, he'd fall behind; and then you would\r\nfind him prowling about the house, setting such a clip to try and\r\ncatch up with himself that Easeby was rapidly becoming a perfect hell\r\nfor man and beast.\r\n\r\nThe idea didn't seem to strike Florence.\r\n\r\n\"I shall do nothing of the kind, Bertie. I wonder you can't appreciate\r\nthe compliment I am paying you--trusting you like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see that all right, but what I mean is, Edwin would do it so\r\nmuch better than I would. These Boy Scouts are up to all sorts of\r\ndodges. They spoor, don't you know, and take cover and creep about,\r\nand what not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bertie, will you or will you not do this perfectly trivial thing for\r\nme? If not, say so now, and let us end this farce of pretending that\r\nyou care a snap of the fingers for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear old soul, I love you devotedly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then will you or will you not----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right,\" I said. \"All right! All right! All right!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then I tottered forth to think it over. I met Jeeves in the\r\npassage just outside.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. I was endeavouring to find you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt that I should tell you, sir, that somebody has been putting\r\nblack polish on our brown walking shoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Who? Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not say, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can anything be done with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI've often wondered since then how these murderer fellows manage to\r\nkeep in shape while they're contemplating their next effort. I had a\r\nmuch simpler sort of job on hand, and the thought of it rattled me to\r\nsuch an extent in the night watches that I was a perfect wreck next\r\nday. Dark circles under the eyes--I give you my word! I had to call on\r\nJeeves to rally round with one of those life-savers of his.\r\n\r\nFrom breakfast on I felt like a bag-snatcher at a railway station. I\r\nhad to hang about waiting for the parcel to be put on the hall table,\r\nand it wasn't put. Uncle Willoughby was a fixture in the library,\r\nadding the finishing touches to the great work, I supposed, and the\r\nmore I thought the thing over the less I liked it. The chances against\r\nmy pulling it off seemed about three to two, and the thought of what\r\nwould happen if I didn't gave me cold shivers down the spine. Uncle\r\nWilloughby was a pretty mild sort of old boy, as a rule, but I've\r\nknown him to cut up rough, and, by Jove, he was scheduled to extend\r\nhimself if he caught me trying to get away with his life work.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't till nearly four that he toddled out of the library with the\r\nparcel under his arm, put it on the table, and toddled off again. I\r\nwas hiding a bit to the south-east at the moment, behind a suit of\r\narmour. I bounded out and legged it for the table. Then I nipped\r\nupstairs to hide the swag. I charged in like a mustang and nearly\r\nstubbed my toe on young blighted Edwin, the Boy Scout. He was standing\r\nat the chest of drawers, confound him, messing about with my ties.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm tidying your room. It's my last Saturday's act of kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last Saturday's?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm five days behind. I was six till last night, but I polished your\r\nshoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Did you see them? I just happened to think of it. I was in here,\r\nlooking round. Mr. Berkeley had this room while you were away. He left\r\nthis morning. I thought perhaps he might have left something in it\r\nthat I could have sent on. I've often done acts of kindness that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be a comfort to one and all!\"\r\n\r\nIt became more and more apparent to me that this infernal kid must\r\nsomehow be turned out eftsoons or right speedily. I had hidden the\r\nparcel behind my back, and I didn't think he had seen it; but I wanted\r\nto get at that chest of drawers quick, before anyone else came along.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't bother about tidying the room,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I like tidying it. It's not a bit of trouble--really.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's quite tidy now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so tidy as I shall make it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was getting perfectly rotten. I didn't want to murder the kid,\r\nand yet there didn't seem any other way of shifting him. I pressed\r\ndown the mental accelerator. The old lemon throbbed fiercely. I got an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\"There's something much kinder than that which you could do,\" I said.\r\n\"You see that box of cigars? Take it down to the smoking-room and snip\r\noff the ends for me. That would save me no end of trouble. Stagger\r\nalong, laddie.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed a bit doubtful; but he staggered. I shoved the parcel into a\r\ndrawer, locked it, trousered the key, and felt better. I might be a\r\nchump, but, dash it, I could out-general a mere kid with a face like a\r\nferret. I went downstairs again. Just as I was passing the\r\nsmoking-room door, out curveted Edwin. It seemed to me that if he\r\nwanted to do a real act of kindness he would commit suicide.\r\n\r\n\"I'm snipping them,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Snip on! Snip on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you like them snipped much, or only a bit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Medium.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'll be getting on, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we parted.\r\n\r\nFellows who know all about that sort of thing--detectives, and so\r\non--will tell you that the most difficult thing in the world is to get\r\nrid of the body. I remember, as a kid, having to learn by heart a poem\r\nabout a bird by the name of Eugene Aram, who had the deuce of a job in\r\nthis respect. All I can recall of the actual poetry is the bit that\r\ngoes:\r\n\r\n    _Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum-tumty-tum,\r\n    I slew him, tum-tum-tum!_\r\n\r\nBut I recollect that the poor blighter spent much of his valuable time\r\ndumping the corpse into ponds and burying it, and what not, only to\r\nhave it pop out at him again. It was about an hour after I had shoved\r\nthe parcel into the drawer when I realised that I had let myself in\r\nfor just the same sort of thing.\r\n\r\nFlorence had talked in an airy sort of way about destroying the\r\nmanuscript; but when one came down to it, how the deuce can a chap\r\ndestroy a great chunky mass of paper in somebody else's house in the\r\nmiddle of summer? I couldn't ask to have a fire in my bedroom, with\r\nthe thermometer in the eighties. And if I didn't burn the thing, how\r\nelse could I get rid of it? Fellows on the battle-field eat dispatches\r\nto keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy, but it would\r\nhave taken me a year to eat Uncle Willoughby's Recollections.\r\n\r\nI'm bound to say the problem absolutely baffled me. The only thing\r\nseemed to be to leave the parcel in the drawer and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether you have ever experienced it, but it's a dashed\r\nunpleasant thing having a crime on one's conscience. Towards the end\r\nof the day the mere sight of the drawer began to depress me. I found\r\nmyself getting all on edge; and once when Uncle Willoughby trickled\r\nsilently into the smoking-room when I was alone there and spoke to me\r\nbefore I knew he was there, I broke the record for the sitting high\r\njump.\r\n\r\nI was wondering all the time when Uncle Willoughby would sit up and\r\ntake notice. I didn't think he would have time to suspect that\r\nanything had gone wrong till Saturday morning, when he would be\r\nexpecting, of course, to get the acknowledgment of the manuscript from\r\nthe publishers. But early on Friday evening he came out of the library\r\nas I was passing and asked me to step in. He was looking considerably\r\nrattled.\r\n\r\n\"Bertie,\" he said--he always spoke in a precise sort of pompous kind\r\nof way--\"an exceedingly disturbing thing has happened. As you know, I\r\ndispatched the manuscript of my book to Messrs. Riggs and Ballinger,\r\nthe publishers, yesterday afternoon. It should have reached them by\r\nthe first post this morning. Why I should have been uneasy I cannot\r\nsay, but my mind was not altogether at rest respecting the safety of\r\nthe parcel. I therefore telephoned to Messrs. Riggs and Ballinger a\r\nfew moments back to make enquiries. To my consternation they informed\r\nme that they were not yet in receipt of my manuscript.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very rum!\"\r\n\r\n\"I recollect distinctly placing it myself on the hall table in good\r\ntime to be taken to the village. But here is a sinister thing. I have\r\nspoken to Oakshott, who took the rest of the letters to the post\r\noffice, and he cannot recall seeing it there. He is, indeed,\r\nunswerving in his assertions that when he went to the hall to collect\r\nthe letters there was no parcel among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds funny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bertie, shall I tell you what I suspect?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The suspicion will no doubt sound to you incredible, but it alone\r\nseems to fit the facts as we know them. I incline to the belief that\r\nthe parcel has been stolen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say! Surely not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait! Hear me out. Though I have said nothing to you before, or to\r\nanyone else, concerning the matter, the fact remains that during the\r\npast few weeks a number of objects--some valuable, others not--have\r\ndisappeared in this house. The conclusion to which one is irresistibly\r\nimpelled is that we have a kleptomaniac in our midst. It is a\r\npeculiarity of kleptomania, as you are no doubt aware, that the\r\nsubject is unable to differentiate between the intrinsic values of\r\nobjects. He will purloin an old coat as readily as a diamond ring, or\r\na tobacco pipe costing but a few shillings with the same eagerness as\r\na purse of gold. The fact that this manuscript of mine could be of no\r\npossible value to any outside person convinces me that----\"\r\n\r\n\"But, uncle, one moment; I know all about those things that were\r\nstolen. It was Meadowes, my man, who pinched them. I caught him\r\nsnaffling my silk socks. Right in the act, by Jove!\"\r\n\r\nHe was tremendously impressed.\r\n\r\n\"You amaze me, Bertie! Send for the man at once and question him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he isn't here. You see, directly I found that he was a\r\nsock-sneaker I gave him the boot. That's why I went to London--to\r\nget a new man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if the man Meadowes is no longer in the house it could not be\r\nhe who purloined my manuscript. The whole thing is inexplicable.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which we brooded for a bit. Uncle Willoughby pottered about the\r\nroom, registering baffledness, while I sat sucking at a cigarette,\r\nfeeling rather like a chappie I'd once read about in a book, who\r\nmurdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table,\r\nand then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there\r\nall the time. My guilty secret oppressed me to such an extent that\r\nafter a while I couldn't stick it any longer. I lit another cigarette\r\nand started for a stroll in the grounds, by way of cooling off.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those still evenings you get in the summer, when you can\r\nhear a snail clear its throat a mile away. The sun was sinking over\r\nthe hills and the gnats were fooling about all over the place, and\r\neverything smelled rather topping--what with the falling dew and so\r\non--and I was just beginning to feel a little soothed by the peace of\r\nit all when suddenly I heard my name spoken.\r\n\r\n\"It's about Bertie.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the loathsome voice of young blighted Edwin! For a moment I\r\ncouldn't locate it. Then I realised that it came from the library. My\r\nstroll had taken me within a few yards of the open window.\r\n\r\nI had often wondered how those Johnnies in books did it--I mean the\r\nfellows with whom it was the work of a moment to do about a dozen\r\nthings that ought to have taken them about ten minutes. But, as a\r\nmatter of fact, it was the work of a moment with me to chuck away my\r\ncigarette, swear a bit, leap about ten yards, dive into a bush that\r\nstood near the library window, and stand there with my ears flapping.\r\nI was as certain as I've ever been of anything that all sorts of\r\nrotten things were in the offing.\r\n\r\n\"About Bertie?\" I heard Uncle Willoughby say.\r\n\r\n\"About Bertie and your parcel. I heard you talking to him just now. I\r\nbelieve he's got it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I tell you that just as I heard these frightful words a fairly\r\nsubstantial beetle of sorts dropped from the bush down the back of my\r\nneck, and I couldn't even stir to squash the same, you will understand\r\nthat I felt pretty rotten. Everything seemed against me.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, boy? I was discussing the disappearance of my\r\nmanuscript with Bertie only a moment back, and he professed himself as\r\nperplexed by the mystery as myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was in his room yesterday afternoon, doing him an act of\r\nkindness, and he came in with a parcel. I could see it, though he\r\ntried to keep it behind his back. And then he asked me to go to the\r\nsmoking-room and snip some cigars for him; and about two minutes\r\nafterwards he came down--and he wasn't carrying anything. So it must\r\nbe in his room.\"\r\n\r\nI understand they deliberately teach these dashed Boy Scouts to\r\ncultivate their powers of observation and deduction and what not.\r\nDevilish thoughtless and inconsiderate of them, I call it. Look at the\r\ntrouble it causes.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds incredible,\" said Uncle Willoughby, thereby bucking me up a\r\ntrifle.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I go and look in his room?\" asked young blighted Edwin. \"I'm\r\nsure the parcel's there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what could be his motive for perpetrating this extraordinary\r\ntheft?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he's a--what you said just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"A kleptomaniac? Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have been Bertie who took all those things from the very\r\nstart,\" suggested the little brute hopefully. \"He may be like\r\nRaffles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Raffles?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a chap in a book who went about pinching things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot believe that Bertie would--ah--go about pinching things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure he's got the parcel. I'll tell you what you might do.\r\nYou might say that Mr. Berkeley wired that he had left something here.\r\nHe had Bertie's room, you know. You might say you wanted to look for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be possible. I----\"\r\n\r\nI didn't wait to hear any more. Things were getting too hot. I sneaked\r\nsoftly out of my bush and raced for the front door. I sprinted up to\r\nmy room and made for the drawer where I had put the parcel. And then I\r\nfound I hadn't the key. It wasn't for the deuce of a time that I\r\nrecollected I had shifted it to my evening trousers the night before\r\nand must have forgotten to take it out again.\r\n\r\nWhere the dickens were my evening things? I had looked all over the\r\nplace before I remembered that Jeeves must have taken them away to\r\nbrush. To leap at the bell and ring it was, with me, the work of a\r\nmoment. I had just rung it when there was a footstep outside, and in\r\ncame Uncle Willoughby.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bertie,\" he said, without a blush, \"I have--ah--received a\r\ntelegram from Berkeley, who occupied this room in your absence, asking\r\nme to forward him his--er--his cigarette-case, which, it would appear,\r\nhe inadvertently omitted to take with him when he left the house. I\r\ncannot find it downstairs; and it has, therefore, occurred to me that\r\nhe may have left it in this room. I will--er--just take a look\r\naround.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most disgusting spectacles I've ever seen--this\r\nwhite-haired old man, who should have been thinking of the hereafter,\r\nstanding there lying like an actor.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't seen it anywhere,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I will search. I must--ah--spare no effort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have seen it if it had been here--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may have escaped your notice. It is--er--possibly in one of the\r\ndrawers.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to nose about. He pulled out drawer after drawer, pottering\r\naround like an old bloodhound, and babbling from time to time about\r\nBerkeley and his cigarette-case in a way that struck me as perfectly\r\nghastly. I just stood there, losing weight every moment.\r\n\r\nThen he came to the drawer where the parcel was.\r\n\r\n\"This appears to be locked,\" he said, rattling the handle.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I shouldn't bother about that one. It--it's--er--locked, and all\r\nthat sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not the key?\"\r\n\r\nA soft, respectful voice spoke behind me.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy, sir, that this must be the key you require. It was in the\r\npocket of your evening trousers.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Jeeves. He had shimmered in, carrying my evening things, and\r\nwas standing there holding out the key. I could have massacred the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said my uncle.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment Uncle Willoughby had opened the drawer. I shut my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Uncle Willoughby, \"there is nothing here. The drawer is\r\nempty. Thank you, Bertie. I hope I have not disturbed you. I\r\nfancy--er--Berkeley must have taken his case with him after all.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone I shut the door carefully. Then I turned to Jeeves.\r\nThe man was putting my evening things out on a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Jeeves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\r\n\r\nIt was deuced difficult to know how to begin.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Jeeves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you--Was there--Have you by chance----\"\r\n\r\n\"I removed the parcel this morning, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--ah--why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I considered it more prudent, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI mused for a while.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I suppose all this seems tolerably rummy to you, Jeeves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir. I chanced to overhear you and Lady Florence speaking\r\nof the matter the other evening, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you, by Jove?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--er--Jeeves, I think that, on the whole, if you were to--as it\r\nwere--freeze on to that parcel until we get back to London----\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then we might--er--so to speak--chuck it away somewhere--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll leave it in your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, Jeeves, you're by way of being rather a topper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"One in a million, by Jove!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very kind of you to say so, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's about all, then, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nFlorence came back on Monday. I didn't see her till we were all having\r\ntea in the hall. It wasn't till the crowd had cleared away a bit that\r\nwe got a chance of having a word together.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bertie?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have destroyed the manuscript?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly; but----\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean I haven't absolutely----\"\r\n\r\n\"Bertie, your manner is furtive!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right. It's this way----\"\r\n\r\nAnd I was just going to explain how things stood when out of the\r\nlibrary came leaping Uncle Willoughby looking as braced as a\r\ntwo-year-old. The old boy was a changed man.\r\n\r\n\"A most remarkable thing, Bertie! I have just been speaking with Mr.\r\nRiggs on the telephone, and he tells me he received my manuscript by\r\nthe first post this morning. I cannot imagine what can have caused the\r\ndelay. Our postal facilities are extremely inadequate in the rural\r\ndistricts. I shall write to headquarters about it. It is insufferable\r\nif valuable parcels are to be delayed in this fashion.\"\r\n\r\nI happened to be looking at Florence's profile at the moment, and at\r\nthis juncture she swung round and gave me a look that went right\r\nthrough me like a knife. Uncle Willoughby meandered back to the\r\nlibrary, and there was a silence that you could have dug bits out of\r\nwith a spoon.\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand it,\" I said at last. \"I can't understand it, by\r\nJove!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can. I can understand it perfectly, Bertie. Your heart failed you.\r\nRather than risk offending your uncle you----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Absolutely!\"\r\n\r\n\"You preferred to lose me rather than risk losing the money. Perhaps\r\nyou did not think I meant what I said. I meant every word. Our\r\nengagement is ended.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--I say!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not another word!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Florence, old thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to hear any more. I see now that your Aunt Agatha was\r\nperfectly right. I consider that I have had a very lucky escape. There\r\nwas a time when I thought that, with patience, you might be moulded\r\ninto something worth while. I see now that you are impossible!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she popped off, leaving me to pick up the pieces. When I had\r\ncollected the debris to some extent I went to my room and rang for\r\nJeeves. He came in looking as if nothing had happened or was ever\r\ngoing to happen. He was the calmest thing in captivity.\r\n\r\n\"Jeeves!\" I yelled. \"Jeeves, that parcel has arrived in London!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you send it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I acted for the best, sir. I think that both you and Lady\r\nFlorence overestimated the danger of people being offended at being\r\nmentioned in Sir Willoughby's Recollections. It has been my\r\nexperience, sir, that the normal person enjoys seeing his or her name\r\nin print, irrespective of what is said about them. I have an aunt,\r\nsir, who a few years ago was a martyr to swollen limbs. She tried\r\nWalkinshaw's Supreme Ointment and obtained considerable relief--so\r\nmuch so that she sent them an unsolicited testimonial. Her pride at\r\nseeing her photograph in the daily papers in connection with\r\ndescriptions of her lower limbs before taking, which were nothing less\r\nthan revolting, was so intense that it led me to believe that\r\npublicity, of whatever sort, is what nearly everybody desires.\r\nMoreover, if you have ever studied psychology, sir, you will know that\r\nrespectable old gentlemen are by no means averse to having it\r\nadvertised that they were extremely wild in their youth. I have an\r\nuncle----\"\r\n\r\nI cursed his aunts and his uncles and him and all the rest of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that Lady Florence has broken off her engagement with\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\r\n\r\nNot a bit of sympathy! I might have been telling him it was a fine\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"You're sacked!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe coughed gently.\r\n\r\n\"As I am no longer in your employment, sir, I can speak freely without\r\nappearing to take a liberty. In my opinion you and Lady Florence were\r\nquite unsuitably matched. Her ladyship is of a highly determined and\r\narbitrary temperament, quite opposed to your own. I was in Lord\r\nWorplesdon's service for nearly a year, during which time I had ample\r\nopportunities of studying her ladyship. The opinion of the servants'\r\nhall was far from favourable to her. Her ladyship's temper caused a\r\ngood deal of adverse comment among us. It was at times quite\r\nimpossible. You would not have been happy, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you would also have found her educational methods a little\r\ntrying, sir. I have glanced at the book her ladyship gave you--it has\r\nbeen lying on your table since our arrival--and it is, in my opinion,\r\nquite unsuitable. You would not have enjoyed it. And I have it from\r\nher ladyship's own maid, who happened to overhear a conversation\r\nbetween her ladyship and one of the gentlemen staying here--Mr.\r\nMaxwell, who is employed in an editorial capacity by one of the\r\nreviews--that it was her intention to start you almost immediately\r\nupon Nietzsche. You would not enjoy Nietzsche, sir. He is\r\nfundamentally unsound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt's rummy how sleeping on a thing often makes you feel quite\r\ndifferent about it. It's happened to me over and over again. Somehow\r\nor other, when I woke next morning the old heart didn't feel half so\r\nbroken as it had done. It was a perfectly topping day, and there was\r\nsomething about the way the sun came in at the window and the row the\r\nbirds were kicking up in the ivy that made me half wonder whether\r\nJeeves wasn't right. After all, though she had a wonderful profile,\r\nwas it such a catch being engaged to Florence Craye as the casual\r\nobserver might imagine? Wasn't there something in what Jeeves had said\r\nabout her character? I began to realise that my ideal wife was\r\nsomething quite different, something a lot more clinging and drooping\r\nand prattling, and what not.\r\n\r\nI had got as far as this in thinking the thing out when that \"Types of\r\nEthical Theory\" caught my eye. I opened it, and I give you my honest\r\nword this was what hit me:\r\n\r\n    _Of the two antithetic terms in the Greek philosophy one only\r\n    was real and self-subsisting; and that one was Ideal Thought as\r\n    opposed to that which it has to penetrate and mould. The other,\r\n    corresponding to our Nature, was in itself phenomenal, unreal,\r\n    without any permanent footing, having no predicates that held\r\n    true for two moments together, in short, redeemed from negation\r\n    only by including indwelling realities appearing through_.\r\n\r\nWell--I mean to say--what? And Nietzsche, from all accounts, a lot\r\nworse than that!\r\n\r\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, when he came in with my morning tea, \"I've been\r\nthinking it over. You're engaged again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI sucked down a cheerful mouthful. A great respect for this bloke's\r\njudgment began to soak through me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jeeves,\" I said; \"about that check suit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it really a frost?\"\r\n\r\n\"A trifle too bizarre, sir, in my opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But lots of fellows have asked me who my tailor is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless in order to avoid him, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's supposed to be one of the best men in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am saying nothing against his moral character, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated a bit. I had a feeling that I was passing into this\r\nchappie's clutches, and that if I gave in now I should become just\r\nlike poor old Aubrey Fothergill, unable to call my soul my own. On the\r\nother hand, this was obviously a cove of rare intelligence, and it\r\nwould be a comfort in a lot of ways to have him doing the thinking for\r\nme. I made up my mind.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Jeeves,\" I said. \"You know! Give the bally thing away to\r\nsomebody!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked down at me like a father gazing tenderly at the wayward\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir. I gave it to the under-gardener last night. A little\r\nmore tea, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISENTANGLING OLD DUGGIE\r\n\r\n\r\nDoesn't some poet or philosopher fellow say that it's when our\r\nintentions are best that we always make the worst breaks? I can't put\r\nmy hand on the passage, but you'll find it in Shakespeare or\r\nsomewhere, I'm pretty certain.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it's always that way with me. And the affair of Douglas\r\nCraye is a case in point.\r\n\r\nI had dined with Duggie (a dear old pal of mine) one night at his\r\nclub, and as he was seeing me out he said: \"Reggie, old top\"--my\r\nname's Reggie Pepper--\"Reggie, old top, I'm rather worried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you, Duggie, old pal?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Reggie, old fellow,\" he said, \"I am. It's like this. The Booles\r\nhave asked me down to their place for the week-end, and I don't know\r\nwhether to go or not. You see, they have early breakfast, and besides\r\nthat there's a frightful risk of music after dinner. On the other\r\nhand, young Roderick Boole thinks he can play piquet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should go,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not sure Roderick's going to be there this time.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a problem, and I didn't wonder poor old Dug had looked pale and\r\ntired at dinner.\r\n\r\nThen I had the idea which really started all the trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you consult a palmist?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"That sounds a good idea,\" said Duggie.\r\n\r\n\"Go and see Dorothea in Forty-second Street. She's a wonder. She'll\r\nsettle it for you in a second. She'll see from your lines that you are\r\nthinking of making a journey, and she'll either tell you to get a move\r\non, which will mean that Roderick will be there, or else to keep away\r\nbecause she sees disaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be next to the game all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been to a good many of them. You'll like Dorothea.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say her name was--Dorothea? What do I do? Do I just walk\r\nin? Shan't I feel a fearful chump? How much do I give her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five bucks. You'd better write and make a date.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Duggie. \"But I know I shall look a frightful fool.\"\r\n\r\nAbout a week later I ran into him between the acts at the\r\nKnickerbocker. The old boy was beaming.\r\n\r\n\"Reggie,\" he said, \"you did me the best turn anyone's ever done me,\r\nsending me to Mrs. Darrell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Darrell?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know. Dorothea. Her real name's Darrell. She's a widow. Her\r\nhusband was in some regiment, and left her without a penny. It's a\r\nfrightfully pathetic story. Haven't time to tell you now. My boy,\r\nshe's a marvel. She had hardly looked at my hand, when she said: 'You\r\nwill prosper in any venture you undertake.' And next day, by George, I\r\nwent down to the Booles' and separated young Roderick from seventy\r\ndollars. She's a wonderful woman. Did you ever see just that shade of\r\nhair?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't notice her hair.\"\r\n\r\nHe gaped at me in a sort of petrified astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"You--didn't--notice--her--hair!\" he gasped.\r\n\r\nI can't fix the dates exactly, but it must have been about three weeks\r\nafter this that I got a telegram:\r\n\r\n    \"Call Madison Avenue immediately--Florence Craye.\"\r\n\r\nShe needn't have signed her name. I should have known who it was from\r\nby the wording. Ever since I was a kid, Duggie's sister Florence has\r\noppressed me to the most fearful extent. Not that I'm the only one.\r\nHer brothers live in terror of her, I know. Especially Edwin. He's\r\nnever been able to get away from her and it's absolutely broken his\r\nspirit. He's a mild, hopeless sort of chump who spends all his time at\r\nhome--they live near Philadelphia--and has never been known to come to\r\nNew York. He's writing a history of the family, or something, I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nYou see, events have conspired, so to speak, to let Florence do pretty\r\nmuch as she likes with them. Originally there was old man Craye,\r\nDuggie's father, who made a fortune out of the Soup Trust; Duggie's\r\nelder brother Edwin; Florence; and Duggie. Mrs. Craye has been dead\r\nsome years. Then came the smash. It happened through the old man. Most\r\npeople, if you ask them, will tell you that he ought to be in\r\nBloomingdale; and I'm not sure they're not right. At any rate, one\r\nmorning he came down to breakfast, lifted the first cover on the\r\nsideboard, said in a sort of despairing way, \"Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Curse\r\nall eggs!\" and walked out of the room. Nobody thought much of it till\r\nabout an hour afterward, when they found that he had packed a grip,\r\nleft the house, and caught the train to New York. Next day they got a\r\nletter from him, saying that he was off to Europe, never to return,\r\nand that all communications were to be addressed to his lawyers. And\r\nfrom that day on none of them had seen him. He wrote occasionally,\r\ngenerally from Paris; and that was all.\r\n\r\nWell, directly news of this got about, down swooped a series of aunts\r\nto grab the helm. They didn't stay long. Florence had them out, one\r\nafter the other, in no time. If any lingering doubt remained in their\r\nminds, don't you know, as to who was going to be boss at home, it\r\nwasn't her fault. Since then she has run the show.\r\n\r\nI went to Madison Avenue. It was one of the aunts' houses. There was\r\nno sign of the aunt when I called--she had probably climbed a tree and\r\npulled it up after her--but Florence was there.\r\n\r\nShe is a tall woman with what, I believe, is called \"a presence.\" Her\r\neyes are bright and black, and have a way of getting right inside you,\r\ndon't you know, and running up and down your spine. She has a deep\r\nvoice. She is about ten years older than Duggie's brother Edwin, who\r\nis six years older than Duggie.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" she said. \"Sit down.\"\r\n\r\nI poured myself into a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Reginald,\" she said, \"what is this I hear about Douglas?\"\r\n\r\nI said I didn't know.\r\n\r\n\"He says that you introduced him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"To this woman--this Mrs. Darrell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Darrell?\"\r\n\r\nMy memory's pretty rocky, and the name conveyed nothing to me.\r\n\r\nShe pulled out a letter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"Mrs. Dorothy Darrell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! Dorothea!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes resumed their spine drill.\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a palmist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a palmist!\" Her voice absolutely boomed. \"Well, my brother\r\nDouglas is engaged to be married to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many happy returns of the day,\" I said.\r\n\r\nI don't know why I said it. It wasn't what I meant to say. I'm not\r\nsure I meant to say anything.\r\n\r\nShe glared at me. By this time I was pure jelly. I simply flowed about\r\nthe chair.\r\n\r\n\"You are facetious, Reginald,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no,\" I shouted. \"It slipped out. I wouldn't be facetious for\r\nworlds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad. It is no laughing matter. Have you any suggestions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suggestions?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't imagine it can be allowed to go on? The engagement must be\r\nbroken, of course. But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell him he mustn't?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall naturally express my strong disapproval, but it may not be\r\neffective. When out of the reach of my personal influence, my wretched\r\nbrother is self-willed to a degree.\"\r\n\r\nI saw what she meant. Good old Duggie wasn't going to have those eyes\r\npatrolling his spine if he knew it. He meant to keep away and conduct\r\nthis business by letter. There was going to be no personal interview\r\nwith sister, if he had to dodge about America like a snipe.\r\n\r\nWe sat for a long time without speaking. Then I became rather subtle.\r\nI had a brain-wave and saw my way to making things right for Dug and\r\nat the same time squaring myself with Florence. After all, I thought,\r\nthe old boy couldn't keep away from home for the rest of his life. He\r\nwould have to go there sooner or later. And my scheme made it pleasant\r\nand easy for him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I should do if I were you,\" I said. \"I'm not sure\r\nI didn't read some book or see some play somewhere or other where they\r\ntried it on, and it worked all right. Fellow got engaged to a girl,\r\nand the family didn't like it, but, instead of kicking, they pretended\r\nto be tickled to pieces, and had the fellow and the girl down to visit\r\nthem. And then, after the fellow had seen the girl with the home\r\ncircle as a background, don't you know, he came to the conclusion that\r\nit wouldn't do, and broke off the engagement.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to strike her.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly expected so sensible a suggestion from you, Reginald,\" she\r\nsaid. \"It is a very good plan. It shows that you really have a\r\ndefinite substratum of intelligence; and it is all the more deplorable\r\nthat you should idle your way through the world as you do, when you\r\nmight be performing some really useful work.\"\r\n\r\nThat was Florence all over. Even when she patted you on the head, she\r\nhad to do it with her knuckles.\r\n\r\n\"I will invite them down next week,\" she went on. \"You had better\r\ncome, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's awfully kind of you, but the fact is----\"\r\n\r\n\"Next Wednesday. Take the three-forty-seven.\"\r\n\r\nI met Duggie next day. He was looking happy, but puzzled, like a man\r\nwho has found a dime on the street and is wondering if there's a\r\nstring tied to it. I congratulated him on his engagement.\r\n\r\n\"Reggie,\" he said, \"a queer thing has happened. I feel as if I'd\r\ntrodden on the last step when it wasn't there. I've just had a letter\r\nfrom my sister Florence asking me to bring Dorothy home on Wednesday.\r\nFlorence doesn't seem to object to the idea of the engagement at all;\r\nand I'd expected that I'd have to call out the police reserves when\r\nshe heard of it. I believe there's a catch somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nI tapped him on the breastbone.\r\n\r\n\"There is, Dug,\" I said, \"and I'll tell you what it is. I saw her\r\nyesterday, and I can put you next to the game. She thinks that if you\r\nsee Mrs. Darrell mingling with the home circle, you'll see flaws in\r\nher which you don't see when you don't see her mingling with the home\r\ncircle, don't you see? Do you see now?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed--heroically, don't you know.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid she'll be disappointed. Love like mine is not dependent on\r\nenvironment.\"\r\n\r\nWhich wasn't bad, I thought, if it was his own.\r\n\r\nI said good-by to him, and toddled along rather pleased with myself.\r\nIt seemed to me that I had handled his affairs in a pretty masterly\r\nmanner for a chap who's supposed to be one of the biggest chumps in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nWell, of course, the thing was an absolute fliver, as I ought to have\r\nguessed it would be. Whatever could have induced me to think that a\r\nfellow like poor old Dug stood a dog's chance against a determined\r\nfemale like his sister Florence, I can't imagine. It was like\r\nexpecting a rabbit to put up a show with a python. From the very start\r\nthere was only one possible end to the thing. To a woman like\r\nFlorence, who had trained herself as tough as whalebone by years of\r\nscrapping with her father and occasional by-battles with aunts, it was\r\nas easy as killing rats with a stick.\r\n\r\nI was sorry for Mrs. Darrell. She was a really good sort and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, just the kind of wife who would have done old Duggie a\r\nbit of good. And on her own ground I shouldn't wonder if she might not\r\nhave made a fight for it. But now she hadn't a chance. Poor old Duggie\r\nwas just like so much putty in Florence's hands when he couldn't get\r\naway from her. You could see the sawdust trickling out of Love's Young\r\nDream in a steady flow.\r\n\r\nI took Mrs. Darrell for a walk one afternoon, to see if I couldn't\r\ncheer her up a bit, but it wasn't much good. She hardly spoke a word\r\ntill we were on our way home. Then she said with a sort of jerk: \"I'm\r\ngoing back to New York tomorrow, Mr. Pepper.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose I ought to have pretended to be surprised, but I couldn't\r\nwork it.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you've had a bad time,\" I said. \"I'm very sorry.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"It's nice of you to be sympathetic instead of\r\ntactful. You're rather a dear, Mr. Pepper.\"\r\n\r\nI hadn't any remarks to make. I whacked at a nettle with my stick.\r\n\r\n\"I shall break off my engagement after dinner, so that Douglas can\r\nhave a good night's rest. I'm afraid he has been brooding on the\r\nfuture a good deal. It will be a great relief to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I know exactly how he feels. He thought he could carry me\r\noff, but he finds he overestimated his powers. He has remembered that\r\nhe is a Craye. I imagine that the fact has been pointed out to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ask my opinion,\" I said--I was feeling pretty sore about\r\nit--\"that woman Florence is an absolute cat.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Pepper, I wouldn't have dreamed of asking your opinion on\r\nsuch a delicate subject. But I'm glad to have it. Thank you very much.\r\nDo I strike you as a vindictive woman, Mr. Pepper?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you do,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"By nature I don't think I am. But I'm feeling a little vindictive\r\njust at present.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why I'm boring you like this, Mr. Pepper,\" she said.\r\n\"For goodness' sake let's be cheerful. Say something bright.\"\r\n\r\nI was going to take a whirl at it, but she started in to talk, and\r\ntalked all the rest of the way. She seemed to have cheered up a whole\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nShe left next day. I gather she fired Duggie as per schedule, for the\r\nold boy looked distinctly brighter, and Florence wore an off-duty\r\nexpression and was quite decently civil. Mrs. Darrell bore up all\r\nright. She avoided Duggie, of course, and put in most of the time\r\ntalking to Edwin. He evidently appreciated it, for I had never seen\r\nhim look so nearly happy before.\r\n\r\nI went back to New York directly afterward, and I hadn't been there\r\nmuch more than a week when a most remarkably queer thing happened.\r\nTurning in at Hammerstein's for half an hour one evening, whom should\r\nI meet but brother Edwin, quite fairly festive, with a fat cigar in\r\nhis mouth. \"Hello, Reggie,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I had to come up to New York to look up a life of Hilary de Craye at\r\nthe library. I believe Mister Man was a sort of ancestor.\"\r\n\r\n\"This isn't the library.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was beginning to guess as much. The difference is subtle but well\r\nmarked.\"\r\n\r\nIt struck me that there was another difference that was subtle but\r\nwell marked, and that was the difference between the Edwin I'd left\r\nmessing about over his family history a week before and the jovial\r\nrounder who was blowing smoke in my face now.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact,\" he said, \"the library would be all the better\r\nfor a little of this sort of thing. It's too conservative. That's\r\nwhat's the trouble with the library. What's the matter with having a\r\ncross-talk team and a few performing dogs there? It would brighten the\r\nplace up and attract custom. Reggie, you're looking fatigued. I've\r\nheard there's a place somewhere in this city, if you can only find it,\r\nexpressly designed for supplying first-aid to the fatigued. Let's go\r\nand look for it.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not given to thinking much as a rule, but I couldn't help\r\npondering over this meeting with Edwin. It's hard to make you see the\r\nremarkableness of the whole thing, for, of course, if you look at it,\r\nin one way, there's nothing so record-breaking in smoking a cigar and\r\ndrinking a highball. But then you have never seen Edwin. There are\r\ndegrees in everything, don't you know. For Edwin to behave as he did\r\nwith me that night was simply nothing more nor less than a frightful\r\noutburst, and it disturbed me. Not that I cared what Edwin did, as a\r\nrule, but I couldn't help feeling a sort of what-d'you-call-it--a\r\npresentiment, that somehow, in some way I didn't understand, I was\r\nmixed up in it, or was soon going to be. I think the whole fearful\r\nfamily had got on my nerves to such an extent that the mere sight of\r\nany of them made me jumpy.\r\n\r\nAnd, by George, I was perfectly right, don't you know. In a day or two\r\nalong came the usual telegram from Florence, telling me to come to\r\nMadison Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe mere idea of Madison Avenue was beginning to give me that tired\r\nfeeling, and I made up my mind I wouldn't go near the place. But of\r\ncourse I did. When it came to the point, I simply hadn't the common\r\nmanly courage to keep away.\r\n\r\nFlorence was there as before.\r\n\r\n\"Reginald,\" she said, \"I think I shall go raving mad.\"\r\n\r\nThis struck me as a mighty happy solution of everybody's troubles, but\r\nI felt it was too good to be true.\r\n\r\n\"Over a week ago,\" she went on, \"my brother Edwin came up to New York\r\nto consult a book at the library. I anticipated that this would occupy\r\nperhaps an afternoon, and was expecting him back by an early train\r\nnext day. He did not arrive. He sent an incoherent telegram. But even\r\nthen I suspected nothing.\" She paused. \"Yesterday morning,\" she said,\r\n\"I had a letter from my aunt Augusta.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused again. She seemed to think I ought to be impressed.\r\n\r\nHer eyes tied a bowknot in my spine.\r\n\r\n\"Let me read you her letter. No, I will tell you its contents. Aunt\r\nAugusta had seen Edwin lunching at the Waldorf with a creature.\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\"\r\n\r\n\"My aunt described her. Her hair was of a curious dull bronze tint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your aunt's?\"\r\n\r\n\"The woman's. It was then that I began to suspect. How many women with\r\ndull bronze hair does Edwin know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! Why ask me?\"\r\n\r\nI had got used to being treated as a sort of \"Hey, Bill!\" by Florence,\r\nbut I was darned if I was going to be expected to be an encyclopedia\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\"One,\" she said. \"That appalling Darrell woman.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday evening,\" she said, \"I saw them together in a taximeter\r\ncab. They were obviously on their way to some theatre.\"\r\n\r\nShe fixed me with her eye.\r\n\r\n\"Reginald,\" she said, \"you must go and see her the first thing\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I cried. \"Me? Why? Why me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you are responsible for the whole affair. You introduced\r\nDouglas to her. You suggested that he should bring her home. Go to her\r\nto-morrow and ascertain her intentions.\"\r\n\r\n\"But----\"\r\n\r\n\"The very first thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wouldn't it be better to have a talk with Edwin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have made every endeavour to see Edwin, but he deliberately avoids\r\nme. His answers to my telegrams are willfully evasive.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that Edwin had effected a thorough bolt. He was\r\nhaving quite a pleasant little vacation: Two Weeks in Sunny New York.\r\nAnd from what I'd seen of him, he seemed to be thriving on it. I\r\ndidn't wonder Florence had got rather anxious. She'd have been more\r\nanxious if she had seen him when I did. He'd got a sort of\r\n\"New-York-is-so-bracing\" look about him, which meant a whole heap of\r\ntrouble before he trotted back to the fold.\r\n\r\nWell, I started off to interview Mrs. Darrell, and, believe me, I\r\ndidn't like the prospect. I think they ought to train A. D. T.\r\nmessengers to do this sort of thing. I found her alone. The rush hour\r\nof clients hadn't begun.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Pepper?\" she said. \"How nice of you to call.\"\r\n\r\nVery friendly, and all that. It made the situation darned difficult\r\nfor a fellow, if you see what I mean.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" I said. \"What about it, don't you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly don't,\" she said. \"What ought I to know about what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, about Edwin--Edwin Craye,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! So you're an ambassador, Mr. Pepper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I did come to see if I could find out how\r\nthings were running. What's going to happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you consulting me professionally? If so, you must show me your\r\nhand. Or perhaps you would rather I showed you mine?\"\r\n\r\nIt was subtle, but I got on to it after a bit.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I wish you would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Do you remember a conversation we had, Mr. Pepper, my last\r\nafternoon at the Crayes'? We came to the conclusion that I was rather\r\na vindictive woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"By George! You're stringing old Edwin so as to put one over on\r\nFlorence?\"\r\n\r\nShe flushed a little.\r\n\r\n\"How very direct you are, Mr. Pepper! How do you know I'm not very\r\nfond of Mr. Craye? At any rate, I'm very sorry for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's such a chump.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's improving every day. Have you seen him? You must notice the\r\ndifference?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"He only wanted taking out of himself. I think he found his sister\r\nFlorence's influence a little oppressive sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but see here,\" I said, \"are you going to marry him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm only a palmist. I don't pretend to be a clairvoyant. A marriage\r\nmay be indicated in Mr. Craye's hand, but I couldn't say without\r\nlooking at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall have to tell her something definite, or she won't give me\r\na moment's peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her her brother is of age. Surely that's definite enough?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I couldn't get any more out of her. I went back to Florence and\r\nreported. She got pretty excited about it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I were a man!\" she said.\r\n\r\nI didn't see how that would have helped. I said so.\r\n\r\n\"I'd go straight to Edwin and _drag_ him away. He is staying at\r\nhis club. If I were a man I could go in and find him----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if you weren't a member,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"--And tell him what I thought of his conduct. As I'm only a woman, I\r\nhave to wait in the hall while a deceitful small boy pretends to go\r\nand look for him.\"\r\n\r\nIt had never struck me before what a splendid institution a club was.\r\nOnly a few days back I'd been thinking that the subscription to mine\r\nwas a bit steep. But now I saw that the place earned every cent of the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no influence with him, Reginald?\"\r\n\r\nI said I didn't think I had. She called me something. Invertebrate, or\r\nsomething. I didn't catch it.\r\n\r\n\"Then there's only one thing to do. You must find my father and tell\r\nhim all. Perhaps you may rouse him to a sense of what is right. You\r\nmay make him remember that he has duties as a parent.\"\r\n\r\nI thought it far more likely that I should make him remember that he\r\nhad a foot. I hadn't a very vivid recollection of old man Craye. I was\r\nquite a kid when he made his great speech on the Egg Question and beat\r\nit for Europe--but what I did recollect didn't encourage me to go and\r\nchat with him about the duties of a parent.\r\n\r\nAs I remember him, he was a rather large man with elephantiasis of the\r\ntemper. I distinctly recalled one occasion when I was spending a\r\nschool vacation at his home, and he found me trying to shave old\r\nDuggie, then a kid of fourteen, with his razor.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't be able to find him,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You can get his address from his lawyers.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may be at the North Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must go to the North Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"But say----!\"\r\n\r\n\"Reginald!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right.\"\r\n\r\nI knew just what would happen. Parbury and Stevens, the lawyers,\r\nsimply looked at me as if I had been caught snatching bags. At least,\r\nStevens did. And Parbury would have done it, too, only he had been\r\ndead a good time. Finally, after drinking me in for about a quarter of\r\nan hour, Stevens said that if I desired to address a communication to\r\nhis client, care of this office, it would be duly forwarded. Good\r\nmorning. Good morning. Anything further? No, thanks. Good morning.\r\nGood morning.\r\n\r\nI handed the glad news on to Florence and left her to do what she\r\nliked about it. She went down and interviewed Stevens. I suppose he'd\r\nhad experience of her. At any rate, he didn't argue. He yielded up the\r\naddress in level time. Old man Craye was living in Paris, but was to\r\narrive in New York that night, and would doubtless be at his club.\r\n\r\nIt was the same club where Edwin was hiding from Florence. I pointed\r\nthis out to her.\r\n\r\n\"There's no need for me to butt in after all,\" I said. \"He'll meet\r\nEdwin there, and they can fight it out in the smoking room. You've\r\nonly to drop him a line explaining the facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall certainly communicate with him in writing, but, nevertheless,\r\nyou must see him. I cannot explain everything in a letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But doesn't it strike you that he may think it pretty bad\r\ngall--impertinence, don't you know, for a comparative stranger like me\r\nto be tackling a delicate family affair like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will explain that you are acting for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be better if old Duggie went along instead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to go, Reginald.\"\r\n\r\nWell, of course, it was all right, don't you know, but I was losing\r\nseveral pounds a day over the business. I was getting so light that I\r\nfelt that, when the old man kicked me, I should just soar up to the\r\nceiling like an air balloon.\r\n\r\nThe club was one of those large clubs that look like prisons. I used\r\nto go there to lunch with my uncle, the one who left me his money, and\r\nI always hated the place. It was one of those clubs that are all red\r\nleather and hushed whispers.\r\n\r\nI'm bound to say, though, there wasn't much hushed whispering when I\r\nstarted my interview with old man Craye. His voice was one of my\r\nchildhood's recollections.\r\n\r\nHe was most extraordinarily like Florence. He had just the same eyes.\r\nI felt boneless from the start.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he said. \"Speak up. Don't mumble.\"\r\n\r\nI hadn't known he was deaf. The last time we'd had any\r\nconversation--on the subject of razors--he had done all the talking.\r\nThis seemed to me to put the lid on it.\r\n\r\n\"I only said 'Good morning,'\" I shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Good what? Speak up. I believe you're sucking candy. Oh, good\r\nmorning? I remember you now. You're the boy who spoiled my razor.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't half like this reopening of old wounds. I hurried on.\r\n\r\n\"I came about Edwin,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Edwin. Your son.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Florence told me to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Florence. Your daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about her?\"\r\n\r\nAll this vaudeville team business, mind you, as if we were bellowing\r\nat each other across the street. All round the room you could see old\r\ngentlemen shooting out of their chairs like rockets and dashing off at\r\na gallop to write to the governing board about it. Thousands of\r\nwaiters had appeared from nowhere, and were hanging about, dusting\r\ntable legs. If ever a business wanted to be discussed privately, this\r\nseemed to me to be it. And it was just about as private as a\r\nconversation through megaphones in Longacre Square.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't she write to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I got a letter from her. I tore it up. I didn't read it.\"\r\n\r\nPleasant, was it not? It was not. I began to understand what a\r\nshipwrecked sailor must feel when he finds there's something gone\r\nwrong with the life belt.\r\n\r\nI thought I might as well get to the point and get it over.\r\n\r\n\"Edwin's going to marry a palmist,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Who the devil's Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Harry. Marry. He's going to marry a palmist.\"\r\n\r\nAbout four hundred waiters noticed a speck of dust on an ash tray at\r\nthe table next to ours, and swooped down on it.\r\n\r\n\"Edwin is going to marry a palmist?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must be mad. Hasn't she seen Edwin?\"\r\n\r\nAnd just then who should stroll in but Edwin himself. I sighted him\r\nand gave him a hail.\r\n\r\nHe curveted up to us. It was amazing the way the fellow had altered.\r\nHe looked like a two-year-old. Flower in his button-hole and a\r\nsix-inch grin, and all that. The old man seemed surprised, too. I\r\ndidn't wonder. The Edwin he remembered was a pretty different kind of\r\na fellow.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, dad,\" he said. \"Fancy meeting you here. Have a cigarette?\"\r\n\r\nHe shoved out his case. Old man Craye helped himself in a sort of\r\ndazed way.\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ Edwin?\" he said slowly.\r\n\r\nI began to sidle out. They didn't notice me. They had moved to a\r\nsettee, and Edwin seemed to be telling his father a funny story.\r\n\r\nAt least, he was talking and grinning, and the old man was making a\r\nnoise like distant thunder, which I supposed was his way of chuckling.\r\nI slid out and left them.\r\n\r\nSome days later Duggie called on me. The old boy was looking scared.\r\n\r\n\"Reggie,\" he said, \"what do doctors call it when you think you see\r\nthings when you don't? Hal-something. I've got it, whatever it is.\r\nIt's sometimes caused by overwork. But it can't be that with me,\r\nbecause I've not been doing any work. You don't think my brain's going\r\nor anything like that, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? What's been happening?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like being haunted. I read a story somewhere of a fellow who\r\nkept thinking he saw a battleship bearing down on him. I've got it,\r\ntoo. Four times in the last three days I could have sworn I saw my\r\nfather and Edwin. I saw them as plainly as I see you. And, of course,\r\nEdwin's at home and father's in Europe somewhere. Do you think it's\r\nsome sort of a warning? Do you think I'm going to die?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, old top,\" I said. \"As a matter of fact, they are both\r\nin New York just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean that? Great Scot, what a relief! But, Reggie, old fox,\r\nit couldn't have been them really. The last time was at Louis\r\nMartin's, and the fellow I mistook for Edwin was dancing all by\r\nhimself in the middle of the floor.\"\r\n\r\nI admitted it was pretty queer.\r\n\r\nI was away for a few days after that in the country. When I got back I\r\nfound a pile of telegrams waiting for me. They were all from Florence,\r\nand they all wanted me to go to Madison Avenue. The last of the batch,\r\nwhich had arrived that morning, was so peremptory that I felt as if\r\nsomething had bitten me when I read it.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I admit I hung back. Then I rallied. There are times in a\r\nman's life when he has got to show a flash of the old bulldog pluck,\r\ndon't you know, if he wants to preserve his self-respect. I did then.\r\nMy grip was still unpacked. I told my man to put it on a cab. And in\r\nabout two ticks I was bowling off to the club. I left for England next\r\nday by the _Lusitania_.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks later I fetched up at Nice. You can't walk far at\r\nNice without bumping into a casino. The one I hit my first evening was\r\nthe Casino Municipale in the Place Masséna. It looked more or less of\r\na Home From Home, so I strolled in.\r\n\r\nThere was quite a crowd round the boule tables, and I squashed in. And\r\nwhen I'd worked through into the front rank I happened to look down\r\nthe table, and there was Edwin, with a green Tyrolese hat hanging over\r\none ear, clutching out for a lot of five-franc pieces which the\r\ncroupier was steering toward him at the end of a rake.\r\n\r\nI was feeling lonesome, for I knew no one in the place, so I edged\r\nround in his direction.\r\n\r\nHalfway there I heard my name called, and there was Mrs. Darrell.\r\n\r\nI saw the whole thing in a flash. Old man Craye hadn't done a thing to\r\nprevent it--apart from being eccentric, he was probably glad that\r\nEdwin had had the sense to pick out anybody half as good a sort--and\r\nthe marriage had taken place. And here they were on their honeymoon.\r\n\r\nI wondered what Florence was thinking of it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well, here we all are,\" I said. \"I've just seen Edwin. He\r\nseems to be winning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear boy!\" she said. \"He does enjoy it so. I think he gets so much\r\nmore out of life than he used to, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure thing. May I wish you happiness? Why didn't you let me know and\r\ncollect the silver fish-slice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you so much, Mr. Pepper. I did write to you, but I suppose you\r\nnever got the letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Craye didn't make any objections, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary. He was more in favor of the marriage than anyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll tell you why,\" I said. \"I'm rather a chump, you know, but I\r\nobserve things. I bet he was most frightfully grateful to you for\r\ntaking Edwin in hand and making him human.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you're wonderful, Mr. Pepper. That is exactly what he said\r\nhimself. It was that that first made us friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--er--Florence?\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid Florence has taken the thing a little badly. But I hope to\r\nwin her over in time. I want all my children to love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All your what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think of them as my children, you see, Mr. Pepper. I adopted them\r\nas my own when I married their father. Did you think I had married\r\nEdwin? What a funny mistake. I am very fond of Edwin, but not in that\r\nway. No, I married Mr. Craye. We left him at our villa tonight, as he\r\nhad some letters to get off. You must come and see us, Mr. Pepper. I\r\nalways feel that it was you who brought us together, you know. I\r\nwonder if you will be seeing Florence when you get back? Will you give\r\nher my very best love?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Wodehouse Miscellany, by P. G. Wodehouse"
