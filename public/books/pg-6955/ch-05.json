    "MR. SCOBELL HAS ANOTHER IDEA\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to collaboration between Fate and Mr. Scobell, John's state entry\r\ninto Mervo was an interesting blend between a pageant and a vaudeville\r\nsketch. The pageant idea was Mr. Scobell's. Fate supplied the\r\nvaudeville.\r\n\r\nThe reception at the quay, when the little steamer that plied between\r\nMarseilles and the island principality gave up its precious freight,\r\nwas not on quite so impressive a scale as might have been given to the\r\nmonarch of a more powerful kingdom; but John was not disappointed.\r\nDuring the voyage from New York, in the intervals of seasickness--for\r\nhe was a poor sailor--Mr. Crump had supplied him with certain facts\r\nabout Mervo, one of which was that its adult population numbered just\r\nunder thirteen thousand, and this had prepared him for any shortcomings\r\nin the way of popular demonstration.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mr. Scobell was exceedingly pleased with the scale\r\nof the reception, which to his mind amounted practically to pomp. The\r\nPalace Guard, forty strong, lined the quay. Besides these, there were\r\nfour officers, a band, and sixteen mounted carbineers. The rest of the\r\narmy was dotted along the streets. In addition to the military, there\r\nwas a gathering of a hundred and fifty civilians, mainly drawn from\r\nfishing circles. The majority of these remained stolidly silent\r\nthroughout, but three, more emotional, cheered vigorously as a young\r\nman was seen to step on to the gangway, carrying a grip, and make for\r\nthe shore. General Poineau, a white-haired warrior with a fierce\r\nmustache, strode forward and saluted. The Palace Guards presented arms.\r\nThe band struck up the Mervian national anthem. General Poineau,\r\nlowering his hand, put on a pair of _pince-nez_ and began to\r\nunroll an address of welcome.\r\n\r\nIt was then seen that the young man was Mr. Crump. General Poineau\r\nremoved his glasses and gave an impatient twirl to his mustache. Mr.\r\nScobell, who for possibly the first time in his career was not smoking\r\n(though, as was afterward made manifest, he had the materials on his\r\nperson), bustled to the front.\r\n\r\n\"Where's his nibs, Crump?\" he enquired.\r\n\r\nThe secretary's reply was swept away in a flood of melody. To the band\r\nMr. Crump's face was strange. They had no reason to suppose that he was\r\nnot Prince John, and they acted accordingly. With a rattle of drums\r\nthey burst once more into their spirited rendering of the national\r\nanthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Scobell sawed the air with his arms, but was powerless to dam the\r\nflood.\r\n\r\n\"His Highness is shaving, sir!\" bawled Mr. Crump, depositing his grip\r\non the quay and making a trumpet of his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Shaving!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I told him he ought to come along, but His Highness said he\r\nwasn't going to land looking like a tramp comedian.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time General Poineau had explained matters to the band and they\r\nchecked the national anthem abruptly in the middle of a bar, with the\r\nexception of the cornet player, who continued gallantly by himself till\r\na feeling of loneliness brought the truth home to him. An awkward stage\r\nwait followed, which lasted until John was seen crossing the deck, when\r\nthere were more cheers, and General Poineau, resuming his\r\n_pince-nez_, brought out the address of welcome again.\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. Scobell made his presence felt.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to meet you, Prince,\" he said, coming forward. \"Scobell's my\r\nname. Shake hands with General Poineau. No, that's wrong. I guess he\r\nkisses your hand, don't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll swing on him if he does,\" said John, cheerfully.\r\n\r\nMr. Scobell eyed him doubtfully. His Highness did not appear to him to\r\nbe treating the inaugural ceremony with that reserved dignity which we\r\nlike to see in princes on these occasions. Mr. Scobell was a business\r\nman. He wanted his money's worth. His idea of a Prince of Mervo was\r\nsomething statuesquely aloof, something--he could not express it\r\nexactly--on the lines of the illustrations in the Zenda stories in the\r\nmagazines--about eight feet high and shinily magnificent, something\r\nthat would give the place a tone. That was what he had had in his mind\r\nwhen he sent for John. He did not want a cheerful young man in a soft\r\nhat and a flannel suit who looked as if at any moment he might burst\r\ninto a college yell.\r\n\r\nGeneral Poineau, meanwhile, had embarked on the address of welcome.\r\nJohn regarded him thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I can see,\" he said to Mr. Scobell, \"that the gentleman is making a\r\ngood speech, but what is he saying? That is what gets past me.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is welcoming Your Highness,\" said Mr. Crump, the linguist, \"in the\r\nname of the people of Mervo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, I notice, have had the bully good sense to stay in bed. I guess\r\nthey knew that the Boy Orator would do all that was necessary. He\r\nhasn't said anything about a bite of breakfast, has he? Has his address\r\nhappened to work around to the subject of shredded wheat and shirred\r\neggs yet? That's the part that's going to make a hit with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There'll be breakfast at my villa, Your Highness,\" said Mr. Scobell.\r\n\"My automobile is waiting along there.\"\r\n\r\nThe General reached his peroration, worked his way through it, and\r\nfinished with a military clash of heels and a salute. The band rattled\r\noff the national anthem once more.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what?\" said John, turning to Mr. Scobell. \"Breakfast?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you'd better say a few words to them, Your Highness; they'll\r\nexpect it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't speak the language, and they can't understand English. The\r\nthing'll be a stand-off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Crump will hand it to 'em. Here, Crump.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Line up and shoot His Highness's remarks into 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\"It's all very well for you, Crump,\" said John. \"You probably enjoy\r\nthis sort of thing. I don't. I haven't felt such a fool since I sang\r\n'The Maiden's Prayer' on Tremont Street when I was joining the frat.\r\nAre you ready? No, it's no good. I don't know what to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell 'em you're tickled to death,\" advised Mr. Scobell anxiously.\r\n\r\nJohn smiled in a friendly manner at the populace. Then he coughed.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said--\"and more particularly the sport on my left who\r\nhas just spoken his piece whose name I can't remember--I thank you for\r\nthe warm welcome you have given me. If it is any satisfaction to you to\r\nknow that it has made me feel like thirty cents, you may have that\r\nsatisfaction. Thirty is a liberal estimate.\"\r\n\r\n\"'His Highness is overwhelmed by your loyal welcome. He thanks you\r\nwarmly,'\" translated Mr. Crump, tactfully.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that we shall get along nicely together,\" continued John. \"If\r\nyou are chumps enough to turn out of your comfortable beds at this time\r\nof the morning simply to see me, you can't be very hard to please. We\r\nshall hit it off fine.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Crump:_ \"His Highness hopes and believes that he will always\r\ncontinue to command the affection of his people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--\" John paused. \"That's the lot,\" he said. \"The flow of inspiration\r\nhas ceased. The magic fire has gone out. Break it to 'em, Crump. For\r\nme, breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the early portion of the ride Mr. Scobell was silent and\r\nthoughtful. John's speech had impressed him neither as oratory nor as\r\nan index to his frame of mind. He had not interrupted him, because he\r\nknew that none of those present could understand what was being said,\r\nand that Mr. Crump was to be relied on as an editor. But he had not\r\nenjoyed it. He did not take the people of Mervo seriously himself, but\r\nin the Prince such an attitude struck him as unbecoming. Then he\r\ncheered up. After all, John had given evidence of having a certain\r\namount of what he would have called \"get-up\" in him. For the purposes\r\nfor which he needed him, a tendency to make light of things was not\r\namiss. It was essentially as a performing prince that he had engaged\r\nJohn. He wanted him to do unusual things, which would make people\r\ntalk--aeroplaning was one that occurred to him. Perhaps a prince who\r\ntook a serious view of his position would try to raise the people's\r\nminds and start reforms and generally be a nuisance. John could, at any\r\nrate, be relied upon not to do that.\r\n\r\nHis face cleared.\r\n\r\n\"Have a good cigar, Prince?\" he said, cordially, inserting two fingers\r\nin his vest-pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Mike,\" said His Highness affably.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, Mr. Scobell replaced the remains of his cigar between\r\nhis lips, and turned to business.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, Prince?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you, Prince,\" said Mr. Scobell, \"to help boom this place.\r\nThat's where you come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said John.\r\n\r\n\"As to ruling and all that,\" continued Mr. Scobell, \"there isn't any to\r\ndo. The place runs itself. Some guy gave it a shove a thousand years\r\nago, and it's been rolling along ever since. What I want you to do is\r\nthe picturesque stunts. Get a yacht and catch rare fishes. Whoop it up.\r\nEntertain swell guys when they come here. Have a Court--see what I\r\nmean?--same as over in England. Go around in aeroplanes and that style\r\nof thing. Don't worry about money. That'll be all right. You draw your\r\nsteady hundred thousand a year and a good chunk more besides, when we\r\nbegin to get a move on, so the dough proposition doesn't need to scare\r\nyou any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I, by George!\" said John. \"It seems to me that I've fallen into a\r\npretty soft thing here. There'll be a joker in the deck somewhere, I\r\nguess. There always is in these good things. But I don't see it yet.\r\nYou can count me in all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good boy,\" said Mr. Scobell. \"And now you'll be wanting to get to the\r\nPalace. I'll have them bring the automobile round.\"\r\n\r\nThe council of state broke up.\r\n\r\nHaving seen John off in the car, the financier proceeded to his\r\nsister's sitting-room. Miss Scobell had breakfasted apart that morning,\r\nby request, her brother giving her to understand that matters of state,\r\nunsuited to the ear of a third party, must be discussed at the meal.\r\nShe was reading her _New York Herald_.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Scobell, \"he's come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"And just the sort I want. Saw the idea of the thing right away, and is\r\nready to go the limit. No nonsense about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he nice-looking, Bennie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. All these Mervo princes have been good-lookers, I hear, and this\r\none must be near the top of the list. You'll like him, Marion. All the\r\ngirls will be crazy about him in a week.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scobell turned a page.\r\n\r\n\"Is he married?\"\r\n\r\nHer brother started.\r\n\r\n\"Married? I never thought of that. But no, I guess he's not. He'd have\r\nmentioned it. He's not the sort to hush up a thing like that. I--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short. His green eyes gleamed excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Marion!\" he cried. \"_Marion!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen. Gee, this thing is going to be the biggest ever. I gotta new\r\nidea. It just came to me. Your saying that put it into my head. Do you\r\nknow what I'm going to do? I'm going to cable over to Betty to come\r\nright along here, and I'm going to have her marry this prince guy. Yes,\r\nsir!\"\r\n\r\nFor once Miss Scobell showed signs that her brother's conversation\r\nreally interested her. She laid down her paper, and stared at him.\r\n\r\n\"Betty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Betty. Why not? She's a pretty girl. Clever too. The Prince'll\r\nbe lucky to get such a wife, for all his darned ancestors away back to\r\nthe flood.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose Betty does not like him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like him? She's gotta like him. Say, can't you make your mind soar, or\r\nwon't you? Can't you see that a thing like this has gotta be fixed\r\ndifferent from a marriage between--between a ribbon-counter clerk and\r\nthe girl who takes the money at a twenty-five-cent hash restaurant in\r\nFlatbush? This is a royal alliance. Do you suppose that when a European\r\nprincess is introduced to the prince she's going to marry, they let her\r\nsay: 'Nothing doing. I don't like the shape of his nose'?\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a spirited imitation of a European princess objecting to the\r\nshape of her selected husband's nose.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't very romantic, Bennie,\" sighed Miss Scobell. She was a\r\nconfirmed reader of the more sentimental class of fiction, and this\r\nbusiness-like treatment of love's young dream jarred upon her.\r\n\r\n\"It's founding a dynasty. Isn't that romantic enough for you? You make\r\nme tired, Marion.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Scobell sighed again.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, dear. I suppose you know best. But perhaps the Prince won't\r\nlike Betty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Scobell gave a snort of disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Marion,\" he said, \"you've got a mind like a chunk of wet dough. Can't\r\nyou understand that the Prince is just as much in my employment as the\r\nman who scrubs the Casino steps? I'm hiring him to be Prince of Mervo,\r\nand his first job as Prince of Mervo will be to marry Betty. I'd like\r\nto see him kick!\" He began to pace the room. \"By Heck, it's going to\r\nmake this place boom to beat the band. It'll be the biggest kind of\r\nadvertisement. Restoration of Royalty at Mervo. That'll make them take\r\nnotice by itself. Then, biff! right on top of that, Royal\r\nRomance--Prince Weds American Girl--Love at First Sight--Picturesque\r\nWedding! Gee, we'll wipe Monte Carlo clean off the map. We'll have 'em\r\nlicked to a splinter. We--It's the greatest scheme on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt you are right, Bennie,\" said Miss Scobell, \"but--\" her\r\nvoice became dreamy again--\"it's not very romantic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shucks!\" said the schemer impatiently. \"Here, where's a cable\r\nform?\""
