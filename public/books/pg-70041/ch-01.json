Let us examine it. There will be stirring happenings on this roof\r\nin due season, and it is well to know the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Sheridan stands in the heart of New York's Bohemian and artistic\r\nquarter. If you threw a brick from any of its windows, you would\r\nbe certain to brain some rising interior decorator, some Vorticist\r\nsculptor or a writer of revolutionary _vers libre_. And a very\r\ngood thing, too. Its roof, cosy, compact and ten storeys above the\r\nstreet, is flat, paved with tiles and surrounded by a low wall,\r\njutting up at one end of which is an iron structure--the fire-escape.\r\nClimbing down this, should the emergency occur, you would find yourself\r\nin the open-air premises of the Purple Chicken restaurant--one of\r\nthose numerous oases in this great city where, in spite of the law of\r\nProhibition, you can still, so the _cognoscenti_ whisper, \"always\r\nget it if they know you.\" A useful thing to remember.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the roof, opposite the fire-escape, stands what\r\nis technically known as a \"small bachelor apartment, penthouse style.\"\r\nIt is a white-walled, red-tiled bungalow, and the small bachelor who\r\nowns it is a very estimable young man named George Finch, originally\r\nfrom East Gilead, Idaho, but now, owing to a substantial legacy from an\r\nuncle, a unit of New York's Latin Quarter. For George, no longer being\r\nobliged to earn a living, has given his suppressed desires play by\r\ncoming to the metropolis and trying his hand at painting. From boyhood\r\nup he had always wanted to be an artist; and now he is an artist; and,\r\nwhat is more, probably the worst artist who ever put brush to canvas.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, that large round thing that looks like a captive\r\nballoon is the water-tank. That small oblong thing that looks like a\r\nsummer-house is George Finch's outdoor sleeping-porch. Those things\r\nthat look like potted shrubs are potted shrubs. That stoutish man\r\nsweeping with a broom is George's valet, cook, and man-of-all-work,\r\nMullett.\r\n\r\nAnd this imposing figure with the square chin and the horn-rimmed\r\nspectacles which, as he comes out from the door leading to the stairs,\r\nflash like jewels in the sun, is no less a person than J. Hamilton\r\nBeamish, author of the famous Beamish Booklets (\"Read Them and Make\r\nthe World Your Oyster\") which have done so much to teach the populace\r\nof the United States observation, perception, judgment, initiative,\r\nwill-power, decision, business acumen, resourcefulness, organisation,\r\ndirective ability, self-confidence, driving-power, originality--and, in\r\nfact, practically everything else from Poultry-Farming to Poetry.\r\n\r\nThe first emotion which any student of the Booklets would have felt on\r\nseeing his mentor in the flesh--apart from that natural awe which falls\r\nupon us when we behold the great--would probably have been surprise at\r\nfinding him so young. Hamilton Beamish was still in the early thirties.\r\nBut the brain of Genius ripens quickly: and those who had the privilege\r\nof acquaintance with Mr. Beamish at the beginning of his career say\r\nthat he knew everything there was to be known--or behaved as if he\r\ndid--at the age of ten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish's first act on reaching the roof of the Sheridan\r\nwas to draw several deep breaths--through the nose, of course. Then,\r\nadjusting his glasses, he cast a flashing glance at Mullett: and,\r\nhaving inspected him for a moment, pursed his lips and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"All wrong!\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe words, delivered at a distance of two feet in the man's immediate\r\nrear, were spoken in the sharp, resonant voice of one who Gets Things\r\nDone--which, in its essentials, is rather like the note of a seal\r\nbarking for fish. The result was that Mullett, who was highly strung,\r\nsprang some eighteen inches into the air and swallowed his chewing-gum.\r\nOwing to that great thinker's practice of wearing No-Jar Rubber Soles\r\n(\"They Save the Spine\"), he had had no warning of Mr. Beamish's\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\"All wrong!\" repeated Mr. Beamish.\r\n\r\nAnd when Hamilton Beamish said \"All wrong!\" it meant \"All wrong!\" He\r\nwas a man who thought clearly and judged boldly, without hedging or\r\nvacillation. He called a Ford a Ford.\r\n\r\n\"Wrong, sir?\" faltered Mullett, when, realising that there had been no\r\nbomb-outrage after all, he was able to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Wrong. Inefficient. Too much waste motion. From the muscular exertion\r\nwhich you are using on that broom you are obtaining a bare sixty-three\r\nor sixty-four per cent of result-value. Correct this. Adjust your\r\nmethods. Have you seen a policeman about here?\"\r\n\r\n\"A policeman, sir?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish clicked his tongue in annoyance. It was waste motion,\r\nbut even efficiency experts have their feelings.\r\n\r\n\"A policeman. I said a policeman and I meant a policeman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you expecting one, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was and am.\"\r\n\r\nMullett cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Would he be wanting anything, sir?\" he asked a little nervously.\r\n\r\n\"He wants to become a poet. And I am going to make him one.\"\r\n\r\n\"A poet, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I could make a poet out of far less promising material. I\r\ncould make a poet out of two sticks and a piece of orange-peel, if they\r\nstudied my booklet carefully. This fellow wrote to me, explaining his\r\ncircumstances and expressing a wish to develop his higher self, and I\r\nbecame interested in his case and am giving him special tuition. He\r\nis coming up here to-day to look at the view and write a description\r\nof it in his own words. This I shall correct and criticise. A simple\r\nexercise in elementary composition.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is ten minutes late. I trust he has some satisfactory explanation.\r\nMeanwhile, where is Mr. Finch? I would like to speak to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch is out, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"He always seems to be out nowadays. When do you expect him back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir. It all depends on the young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch has gone out with a young lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. Just gone to look at one.\"\r\n\r\n\"To look at one?\" The author of the Booklets clicked his tongue once\r\nmore. \"You are drivelling, Mullett. Never drivel--it is dissipation of\r\nenergy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quite true, Mr. Beamish. He has never spoken to this young\r\nlady--only looked at her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, it's like this. I'd noticed for some time past that\r\nMr. Finch had been getting what you might call choosey about his\r\nclothes....\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, choosey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Particular, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then say particular, Mullett. Avoid jargon. Strive for the Word\r\nBeautiful. Read my booklet on Pure English. Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Particular about his clothes, sir, I noticed Mr. Finch had been\r\ngetting. Twice he had started out in blue with the invisible pink twill\r\nand then suddenly stopped at the door of the elevator and gone back\r\nand changed into the dove-grey. And his ties, Mr. Beamish. There was\r\nno satisfying him. So I said to myself 'Hot dog!'\"\r\n\r\n\"You said what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hot dog, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why did you use this revolting expression?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I meant was, sir, that I reckoned I knew what was at the bottom\r\nof all this.\"\r\n\r\n\"And were you right in this reckoning?\"\r\n\r\nA coy look came into Mullett's face.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. You see, Mr. Finch's behaviour having aroused my curiosity,\r\nI took the liberty of following him one afternoon. I followed him to\r\nSeventy-Ninth Street, East, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He walked up and down outside one of those big houses there, and\r\npresently a young lady came out. Mr. Finch looked at her, and she\r\npassed by. Then Mr. Finch looked after her and sighed and came away.\r\nThe next afternoon I again took the liberty of following him, and the\r\nsame thing happened. Only this time the young lady was coming in from\r\na ride in the Park. Mr. Finch looked at her, and she passed into the\r\nhouse. Mr. Finch then remained staring at the house for so long that I\r\nwas obliged to go and leave him at it, having the dinner to prepare.\r\nAnd what I meant, sir, when I said that the duration of Mr. Finch's\r\nabsence depended on the young lady, was that he stops longer when she\r\ncomes in than when she goes out. He might be back at any minute, or he\r\nmight not be back till dinner-time.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish frowned thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like this, Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like love at first sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you read my booklet on 'The Marriage Sane'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, what with one thing and another and being very busy about\r\nthe house....\"\r\n\r\n\"In that booklet I argue very strongly against love at first sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you, indeed, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expose it for the mere delirious folly it is. The mating of the\r\nsexes should be a reasoned process, ruled by the intellect. What sort\r\nof a young lady is this young lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very attractive, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tall? Short? Large? Small?\"\r\n\r\n\"Small, sir. Small and roly-poly.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish shuddered violently.\r\n\r\n\"Don't use that nauseating adjective! Are you trying to convey the idea\r\nthat she is short and stout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, sir, not stout. Just nice and plump. What I should describe as\r\ncuddly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mullett,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"you will not, in my presence and\r\nwhile I have my strength, describe any of God's creatures as cuddly.\r\nWhere you picked it up, I cannot say, but you have the most abhorrent\r\nvocabulary I have ever encountered.... What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\nThe valet was looking past him with an expression of deep concern.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you making faces, Mullett?\" Hamilton Beamish turned. \"Ah,\r\nGarroway,\" he said, \"there you are at last. You should have been here\r\nten minutes ago.\"\r\n\r\nA policeman had come out onto the roof.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nThe policeman touched his cap. He was a long, stringy policeman, who\r\nflowed out of his uniform at odd spots, as if Nature, setting out to\r\nmake a constable, had had a good deal of material left over which it\r\nhad not liked to throw away but hardly seemed able to fit neatly into\r\nthe general scheme. He had large, knobby wrists of a geranium hue and\r\njust that extra four or five inches of neck which disqualify a man for\r\nhigh honours in a beauty competition. His eyes were mild and blue, and\r\nfrom certain angles he seemed all Adam's apple.\r\n\r\n\"I must apologise for being late, Mr. Beamish,\" he said. \"I was\r\ndetained at the station-house.\" He looked at Mullett uncertainly. \"I\r\nthink I have met this gentleman before?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you haven't,\" said Mullett quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Your face seems very familiar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never seen me in your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come this way, Garroway,\" said Hamilton Beamish, interrupting curtly.\r\n\"We cannot waste time in idle chatter.\" He led the officer to the edge\r\nof the roof and swept his hand round in a broad gesture. \"Now, tell me.\r\nWhat do you see?\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman's eye sought the depths.\r\n\r\n\"That's the Purple Chicken down there,\" he said. \"One of these days\r\nthat joint will get pinched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Garroway!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"For some little time I have been endeavouring to instruct you in the\r\nprinciples of pure English. My efforts seem to have been wasted.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman blushed.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Beamish. One keeps slipping into it. It's\r\nthe effect of mixing with the boys--with my colleagues--at the\r\nstation-house. They are very lax in their speech. What I meant was\r\nthat in the near future there was likely to be a raid conducted on the\r\npremises of the Purple Chicken, sir. It has been drawn to our attention\r\nthat the Purple Chicken, defying the Eighteenth Amendment, still\r\npurveys alcoholic liquors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the Purple Chicken. I brought you up here to see what you\r\ncould do in the way of a word-picture of the view. The first thing a\r\npoet needs is to develop his powers of observation. How does it strike\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman gazed mildly at the horizon. His eye flitted from the\r\nroof-tops of the city, spreading away in the distance, to the waters of\r\nthe Hudson, glittering in the sun. He shifted his Adam's apple up and\r\ndown two or three times, as one in deep thought.\r\n\r\n\"It looks very pretty, sir,\" he said at length.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty?\" Hamilton Beamish's eyes flashed. You would never have\r\nthought, to look at him, that the J. in his name stood for James and\r\nthat there had once been people who had called him Jimmy. \"It isn't\r\npretty at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's stark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stark, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stark and grim. It makes your heart ache. You think of all the sorrow\r\nand sordid gloom which those roofs conceal, and your heart bleeds. I\r\nmay as well tell you, here and now, that if you are going about the\r\nplace thinking things pretty, you will never make a modern poet. Be\r\npoignant, man, be poignant!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I will, indeed, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take your note-book and jot down a description of what you see.\r\nI must go down to my apartment and attend to one or two things. Look me\r\nup to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir, but who is that gentleman over there,\r\nsweeping with the broom? His face seemed so very familiar.\"\r\n\r\n\"His name is Mullett. He works for my friend, George Finch. But never\r\nmind about Mullett. Stick to your work. Concentrate! Concentrate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Most certainly, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked with dog-like devotion at the thinker: then, licking the\r\npoint of his pencil, bent himself to his task.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish turned on his No-Jar rubber heel and passed through\r\nthe door to the stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nFollowing his departure, silence reigned for some minutes on the roof\r\nof the Sheridan. Mullett resumed his sweeping, and Officer Garroway\r\nscribbled industriously in his note-book. But after about a quarter\r\nof an hour, feeling apparently that he had observed all there was to\r\nobserve, he put book and pencil away in the recesses of his uniform\r\nand, approaching Mullett, subjected him to a mild but penetrating\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\n\"I feel convinced, Mr. Mullett,\" he said, \"that I have seen your face\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I say you haven't,\" said the valet testily.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you have a brother, Mr. Mullett, who resembles you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dozens. And even mother couldn't tell us apart.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman sighed:\r\n\r\n\"I am an orphan,\" he said, \"without brothers or sisters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stark,\" agreed the policeman. \"Very stark and poignant. You don't\r\nthink I could have seen a photograph of you anywhere, Mr. Mullett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't been taken for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" said Officer Garroway meditatively. \"Somehow--I cannot tell\r\nwhy--I seem to associate your face with a photograph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not your busy day, this, is it?\" said Mullett.\r\n\r\n\"I am off duty at the moment. I seem to see a photograph--several\r\nphotographs--in some sort of collection....\"\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt by now that Mullett had begun to find the\r\nconsideration difficult. He looked like a man who has a favourite aunt\r\nin Poughkeepsie, and is worried about her asthma. He was turning to go,\r\nwhen there came out on to the roof from the door leading to the stairs\r\na young man in a suit of dove-grey.\r\n\r\n\"Mullett!\" he called.\r\n\r\nThe other hurried gratefully towards him, leaving the officer staring\r\npensively at his spacious feet.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Finch?\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a historian with a nice sense of values not to\r\nrecognise the entry of George Finch, following immediately after that\r\nof J. Hamilton Beamish, as an anticlimax. Mr. Beamish filled the\r\neye. An aura of authority went before him as the cloud of fire went\r\nbefore the Israelites in the desert. When you met J. Hamilton Beamish,\r\nsomething like a steam-hammer seemed to hit your consciousness and stun\r\nit long before he came within speaking-distance. In the case of George\r\nFinch nothing of this kind happened.\r\n\r\nGeorge looked what he was, a nice young small bachelor, of the type you\r\nsee bobbing about the place on every side. One glance at him was enough\r\nto tell you that he had never written a Booklet and never would write\r\na Booklet. In figure he was slim and slight; as to the face, pleasant\r\nand undistinguished. He had brown eyes which in certain circumstances\r\ncould look like those of a stricken sheep; and his hair was of a light\r\nchestnut colour. It was possible to see his hair clearly, for he was\r\nnot wearing his hat but carrying it in his hand.\r\n\r\nHe was carrying it reverently, as if he attached a high value to it.\r\nAnd this was strange, for it was not much of a hat. Once it may have\r\nbeen, but now it looked as if it had been both trodden on and kicked\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\"Mullett,\" he said, regarding this relic with a dreamy eye, \"take this\r\nhat and put it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throw it away, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, no! Put it away--very carefully. Have you any\r\ntissue-paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then wrap it up very carefully in tissue-paper and leave it on the\r\ntable in my sitting-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me for interrupting,\" said a deprecating voice behind him, \"but\r\nmight I request a moment of your valuable time, Mr. Finch?\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway had left his fixed point, and was standing in an\r\nattitude that seemed to suggest embarrassment. His mild eyes wore a\r\nsomewhat timid expression.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me if I intrude,\" said officer Garroway.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"I am a policeman, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" said Officer Garroway sadly, \"I have a rather disagreeable\r\nduty to perform, I fear. I would avoid it, if I could reconcile the\r\nact with my conscience, but duty is duty. One of the drawbacks to the\r\npoliceman's life, Mr. Finch, is that it is not easy for him always to\r\ndo the gentlemanly thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" said George.\r\n\r\nMullett swallowed apprehensively. The hunted look had come back to his\r\nface. Officer Garroway eyed him with a gentle solicitude.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to preface my remarks,\" he proceeded, \"by saying that I\r\nhave no personal animus against Mr. Mullett. I have seen nothing in\r\nmy brief acquaintance with Mr. Mullett that leads me to suppose that\r\nhe is not a pleasant companion and zealous in the performance of his\r\nwork. Nevertheless, I think it right that you should know that he is an\r\nex-convict.\"\r\n\r\n\"An ex-convict!\"\r\n\r\n\"Reformed,\" said Mullett hastily.\r\n\r\n\"As to that, I cannot say,\" said Officer Garroway. \"I can but speak of\r\nwhat I know. Very possibly, as he asserts, Mr. Mullett is a reformed\r\ncharacter. But this does not alter the fact that he has done his bit\r\nof time: and in pursuance of my duty I can scarcely refrain from\r\nmentioning this to the gentleman who is his present employer. The\r\nmoment I was introduced to him, I detected something oddly familiar\r\nabout Mr. Mullett's face, and I have just recollected that I recently\r\nsaw a photograph of him in the Rogues Gallery at Headquarters. You\r\nare possibly aware, sir, that convicted criminals are 'mugged'--that\r\nis to say, photographed in various positions--at the commencement of\r\ntheir term of incarceration. This was done to Mr. Mullett some eighteen\r\nmonths ago when he was sentenced to a year's imprisonment for an inside\r\nburglary job. May I ask how Mr. Mullett came to be in your employment?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was sent to me by Mr. Beamish. Mr. Hamilton Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, sir, I have nothing further to say,\" said the policeman,\r\nbowing at the honoured name. \"No doubt Mr. Beamish had excellent\r\nreasons for recommending Mr. Mullett. And, of course, as Mr. Mullett\r\nhas long since expiated his offence, I need scarcely say that we of\r\nthe Force have nothing against him. I merely considered it my duty\r\nto inform you of his previous activities in case you should have any\r\nprejudice against employing a man of his antecedents. I must now\r\nleave you, as my duties compel me to return to the station-house. Good\r\nafternoon, Mr. Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good day, Mr. Mullett. Pleased to have met you. You did not by any\r\nchance run into a young fellow named Joe the Gorilla while you were in\r\nresidence at Sing-Sing? No? I'm sorry. He came from my home town. I\r\nshould have liked news of Joe.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway's departure was followed by a lengthy silence. George\r\nFinch shuffled his feet awkwardly. He was an amiable young man, and\r\ndisliked unpleasant scenes. He looked at Mullett. Mullett looked at the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Mullett,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is rather unfortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most unpleasant for all concerned, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Mr. Beamish might have told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt he considered it unnecessary, sir. Being aware that I had\r\nreformed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but even so.... Er--Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"The officer spoke of an inside burglary job. What was your\r\nexact--er--line?\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to get a place as a valet, sir, and wait till I saw my chance,\r\nand then skin out with everything I could lay my hands on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do think Mr. Beamish might have dropped me a quiet hint. Good\r\nheavens! I may have been putting temptation in your way for weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have, sir,--very serious temptation. But I welcome temptation, Mr.\r\nFinch. Every time I'm left alone with your pearl studs, I have a bout\r\nwith the Tempter. 'Why don't you take them, Mullett?' he says to me,\r\n'Why don't you take them?' It's splendid moral exercise, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, it's awful what that Tempter will suggest to me. Sometimes,\r\nwhen you're lying asleep, he says 'Slip a sponge of Chloroform under\r\nhis nose, Mullett, and clear out with the swag!' Just imagine it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am imagining it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I win every time, sir. I've not lost one fight with that old\r\nTempter since I've been in your employment, Mr. Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same, I don't believe you're going to remain in my employment,\r\nMullett.\"\r\n\r\nMullett inclined his head resignedly.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid of this, sir. The moment that flat-footed cop came on to\r\nthis roof, I had a presentiment that there was going to be trouble.\r\nBut I should appreciate it very much if you could see your way to\r\nreconsider, sir. I can assure you that I have completely reformed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Religion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. Love.\"\r\n\r\nThe word seemed to touch some hidden chord in George Finch. The stern,\r\nset look vanished from his face. He gazed at his companion almost\r\nmeltingly.\r\n\r\n\"Mullett! Do you love?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, indeed, sir. Fanny's her name, sir. Fanny Welch. She's a\r\npickpocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pickpocket!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. And one of the smartest girls in the business. She could\r\ntake your watch out of your waistcoat, and you'd be prepared to swear\r\nshe hadn't been within a yard of you. It's almost an art, sir. But\r\nshe's promised to go straight, if I will, and now I'm saving up to buy\r\nthe furniture. So I do hope, sir, that you will reconsider. It would\r\nset me back if I fell out of a place just now.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge wrinkled his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"I oughtn't to.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's weak of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not it, sir. Christian, I call it.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge pondered.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been with me, Mullett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just on a month, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my pearl studs are still there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still in the drawer, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mullett. You can stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much, indeed, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. The setting sun flung a carpet of gold across the\r\nroof. It was the hour at which men become confidential.\r\n\r\n\"Love is very wonderful, Mullett!\" said George Finch.\r\n\r\n\"Makes the world go round, I often say, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell you something?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mullett,\" said George Finch, \"I, too, love.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surprise me, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may have noticed that I have been fussy about my clothing of late,\r\nMullett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have been, and that was the reason. She lives on East\r\nSeventy-Ninth Street, Mullett. I saw her first lunching at the Plaza\r\nwith a woman who looked like Catherine of Russia. Her mother, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very possibly, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I followed her home. I don't know why I'm telling you this, Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since then I have haunted the side-walk outside her house. Do you know\r\nEast Seventy-Ninth Street?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never been there, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, fortunately it is not a very frequented thoroughfare, or I\r\nshould have been arrested for loitering. Until to-day I have never\r\nspoken to her, Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you did to-day, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Or, rather, she spoke to me. She has a voice like the fluting of\r\nyoung birds in the springtime, Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very agreeable, no doubt, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavenly would express it better. It happened like this, Mullett. I\r\nwas outside the house, when she came along leading a Scotch terrier\r\non a leash. At that moment a gust of wind blew my hat off and it was\r\nbowling past her, when she stopped it. She trod on it, Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this hat which you see in my hand, has been trodden on by Her.\r\nThis very hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the excitement of the moment she dropped the leash, and the Scotch\r\nterrier ran off round the corner in the direction of Brooklyn. I went\r\nin pursuit, and succeeded in capturing it in Lexington Avenue. My hat\r\ndropped off again and was run over by a taxi-cab. But I retained my\r\nhold of the leash, and eventually restored the dog to its mistress. She\r\nsaid--and I want you to notice this very carefully, Mullett,--she said\r\n'Oh, thank you so much!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she, indeed, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"She did. Not merely 'Thank you!' or 'Oh, thank you!' but 'Oh, thank\r\nyou so much!\" George Finch fixed a penetrating stare on his employee.\r\n\"I think that is significant, Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Extremely, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she had wished to end the acquaintance then and there, would she\r\nhave spoken so warmly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I've not told you all. Having said 'Oh, thank you so much!'\r\nshe added: 'He _is_ a naughty dog, isn't he?' You get the\r\nextraordinary subtlety of that, Mullett? The words 'He is a naughty\r\ndog' would have been a mere statement. By adding 'Isn't he?' she\r\ninvited my opinion. She gave me to understand that she would welcome\r\ndiscussion on the subject. Do you know what I am going to do, directly\r\nI have dressed, Mullett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dine, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dine!\" George shuddered. \"No! There are moments when the thought of\r\nfood is an outrage to everything that raises Man above the level of the\r\nbeasts. As soon as I have dressed--and I shall dress very carefully--I\r\nam going to return to East Seventy-Ninth Street and I am going to ring\r\nthe door-bell and I am going to go straight in and inquire after the\r\ndog. Hope it is none the worse for its adventure and so on. After all,\r\nit is only the civil thing. I mean these Scotch terriers ... delicate,\r\nhighly-strung animals.... Never can tell what effect unusual excitement\r\nmay have on them. Yes, Mullett, that is what I propose to do. Brush my\r\ndress clothes as you have never brushed them before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put me out a selection of ties. Say, a dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--did the boot-legger call this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then mix me a very strong whisky-and-soda, Mullett,\" said George\r\nFinch. \"Whatever happens, I must be at my best to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nTo George, sunk in a golden reverie, there entered some few minutes\r\nlater, jarring him back to life, a pair of three-pound dumb-bells,\r\nwhich shot abruptly out of the unknown and came trundling across\r\nthe roof at him with a repulsive, clumping sound that would have\r\ndisconcerted Romeo. They were followed by J. Hamilton Beamish on all\r\nfours. Hamilton Beamish, who believed in the healthy body as well as\r\nthe sound mind, always did half an hour's open-air work with the bells\r\nof an evening: and, not for the first time, he had tripped over the top\r\nstair.\r\n\r\nHe recovered his balance, his dumb-bells and his spectacles in three\r\nlabour-saving movements: and with the aid of the last-named was enabled\r\nto perceive George.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there you are!\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said George, \"and....\"\r\n\r\n\"What's all this I hear from Mullett?\" asked Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" inquired George simultaneously, \"is all this I hear from\r\nMullett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mullett says you're fooling about after some girl up-town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mullett says you knew he was an ex-convict when you recommended him to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish decided to dispose of this triviality before going on\r\nto more serious business.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he said. \"Didn't you read my series in the _Yale\r\nReview_ on the 'Problem of the Reformed Criminal'? I point out very\r\nclearly that there is nobody with such a strong bias towards honesty as\r\nthe man who has just come out of prison. It stands to reason. If you\r\nhad been laid up for a year in hospital as the result of jumping off\r\nthis roof, what would be the one outdoor sport in which, on emerging,\r\nyou would be most reluctant to indulge? Jumping off roofs, undoubtedly.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge continued to frown in a dissatisfied way.\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well, but a fellow doesn't want ex-convicts hanging\r\nabout the home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! You must rid yourself of this old-fashioned prejudice\r\nagainst men who have been in Sing-Sing. Try to look on the place as a\r\nsort of University which fits its graduates for the problems of the\r\nworld without. Morally speaking, such men are the student body. You\r\nhave no fault to find with Mullett, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I can't say I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does his work well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not stole anything from you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why worry? Dismiss the man from your mind. And now let me hear\r\nall about this girl of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know anything about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mullett told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did he know?\"\r\n\r\n\"He followed you a couple of afternoons and saw all.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge turned pink.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go straight in and fire that man. The snake!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will do nothing of the kind. He acted as he did from pure zeal and\r\nfaithfulness. He saw you go out, muttering to yourself....\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I mutter?\" said George, startled.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly you muttered. You muttered, and you were exceedingly strange\r\nin your manner. So naturally Mullett, good zealous fellow, followed you\r\nto see that you came to no harm. He reports that you spend a large\r\npart of your leisure goggling at some girl in Seventy-Ninth Street,\r\nEast.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge's pink face turned a shade pinker. A sullen look came into it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I want to know--what about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't I goggle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said George Finch, looking like a stuffed frog, \"I love her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever read my booklet on 'The Marriage Sane'?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I show there that love is a reasoned emotion that springs from mutual\r\nknowledge, increasing over an extended period of time, and a community\r\nof tastes. How can you love a girl when you have never spoken to her\r\nand don't even know her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do know her name.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"I looked through the telephone directory till I found out who lived\r\nat Number 16, East Seventy-Ninth Street. It took me about a week,\r\nbecause....\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen East Seventy-Ninth Street? You don't mean that this girl\r\nyou've been staring at is little Molly Waddington?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge started.\r\n\r\n\"Waddington is the name, certainly. That's why I was such an infernal\r\ntime getting to it in the book. Waddington, Sigsbee H.\" George choked\r\nemotionally, and gazed at his friend with awed eyes. \"Hamilton!\r\nHammy, old man! You--you don't mean to say you actually know her? Not\r\npositively know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I know her. Know her intimately. Many's the time I've seen\r\nher in her bath-tub.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge quivered from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie! A foul and contemptible....\"\r\n\r\n\"When she was a child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, when she was a child?\" George became calmer. \"Do you mean to say\r\nyou've known her since she was a child? Why, then you must be in love\r\nwith her yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You stand there and tell me,\" said George incredulously, \"that you\r\nhave known this wonderful girl for many years and are not in love with\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge regarded his friend with a gentle pity. He could only explain\r\nthis extraordinary statement by supposing that there was some sort of a\r\nkink in Hamilton Beamish. Sad, for in so many ways he was such a fine\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n\"The sight of her has never made you feel that, to win one smile, you\r\ncould scale the skies and pluck out the stars and lay them at her feet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. Indeed, when you consider that the nearest star is\r\nseveral million....\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said George. \"All right. Let it go. And now,\" he went on\r\nsimply, \"tell me all about her and her people and her house and her dog\r\nand what she was like as a child and when she first bobbed her hair\r\nand who is her favourite poet and where she went to school and what she\r\nlikes for breakfast....\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish reflected.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I first knew Molly when her mother was alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her mother is alive. I've seen her. A woman who looks like Catherine\r\nof Russia.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's her stepmother. Sigsbee H. married again a couple of years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about Sigsbee H.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish twirled a dumb-bell thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee H. Waddington,\" he said, \"is one of those men who must, I\r\nthink, during the formative years of their boyhood have been kicked\r\non the head by a mule. It has been well said of Sigsbee H. Waddington\r\nthat, if men were dominoes, he would be the double-blank. One of the\r\nnumerous things about him that rule him out of serious consideration by\r\nintelligent persons is the fact that he is a synthetic Westerner.\"\r\n\r\n\"A synthetic Westerner?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a little known, but growing, sub-species akin to the synthetic\r\nSoutherner,--with which curious type you are doubtless familiar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. Have you never been in a restaurant where the orchestra\r\nplayed Dixie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, on such occasions you will have noted that the man who\r\ngives a rebel yell and springs on his chair and waves a napkin with\r\nflashing eyes is always a suit-and-cloak salesman named Rosenthal or\r\nBechstein who was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and has never been\r\nfarther South than Far Rockaway. That is the synthetic Southerner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee H. Waddington is a synthetic Westerner. His whole life, with\r\nthe exception of one summer vacation when he went to Maine, has been\r\nspent in New York State: and yet, to listen to him, you would think he\r\nwas an exiled cow-boy. I fancy it must be the effect of seeing too many\r\nWesterns in the movies. Sigsbee Waddington has been a keen supporter\r\nof the motion-pictures from their inception: and was, I believe, one\r\nof the first men in this city to hiss the villain. Whether it was Tom\r\nMix who caused the trouble, or whether his weak intellect was gradually\r\nsapped by seeing William H. Hart kiss his horse I cannot say: but the\r\nfact remains that he now yearns for the great open spaces and, if you\r\nwant to ingratiate yourself with him, all you have to do is to mention\r\nthat you were born in Idaho,--a fact which I hope that, as a rule, you\r\ncarefully conceal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said George enthusiastically. \"I can't tell you how grateful\r\nI am to you, Hamilton, for giving me this information.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be. It will do you no good whatever. When Sigsbee\r\nWaddington married for the second time, he to all intents and purposes\r\nsold himself down the river. To call him a cipher in the home would be\r\nto give a too glowing picture of his importance. He does what his wife\r\ntells him--that and nothing more. She is the one with whom you want to\r\ningratiate yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can this be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be done. Mrs. Sigsbee Waddington is not an easy woman to\r\nconciliate.\"\r\n\r\n\"A tough baby?\" inquired George anxiously.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish frowned.\r\n\r\n\"I dislike the expression. It is the sort of expression Mullett would\r\nuse: and I know few things more calculated to make a thinking man\r\nshudder than Mullett's vocabulary. Nevertheless, in a certain crude,\r\nhorrible way it does describe Mrs. Waddington. There is an ancient\r\nbelief in Tibet that mankind is descended from a demoness named\r\nDrasrinmo and a monkey. Both Sigsbee H. and Mrs. Waddington do much to\r\nbear out this theory. I am loath to speak ill of a woman, but it is no\r\nuse trying to conceal the fact that Mrs. Waddington is a bounder and a\r\nsnob and has a soul like the under-side of a flat stone. She worships\r\nwealth and importance. She likes only the rich and the titled. As a\r\nmatter of fact, I happen to know that there is an English lord hanging\r\nabout the place whom she wants Molly to marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over my dead body,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"That could no doubt be arranged. My poor George,\" said Hamilton\r\nBeamish, laying a dumb-bell affectionately on his friend's head, \"you\r\nare taking on too big a contract. You are going out of your class. It\r\nis not as if you were one of these dashing, young Lochinvar fellows.\r\nYou are mild and shy. You are diffident and timid. I class you among\r\nNature's white mice. It would take a woman like Mrs. Sigsbee Waddington\r\nabout two and a quarter minutes to knock you for a row of Portuguese\r\nash-cans,--er, as Mullett would say,\" added Hamilton Beamish with a\r\ntouch of confusion.\r\n\r\n\"She couldn't eat me,\" said George valiantly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know so much. She is not a vegetarian.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking,\" said George, \"that you might take me round and\r\nintroduce me....\"\r\n\r\n\"And have your blood on my head? No, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, my blood? You talk as if this woman were a syndicate\r\nof gunmen. I'm not afraid of her. To get to know Molly\"--George\r\ngulped--\"I would fight a mad bull.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish was touched. This great man was human.\r\n\r\n\"These are brave words, George. You extort my admiration. I disapprove\r\nof the reckless, unconsidered way you are approaching this matter, and\r\nI still think you would be well advised to read 'The Marriage Sane'\r\nand get a proper estimate of Love: but I cannot but like your spirit.\r\nIf you really wish it, therefore, I will take you round and introduce\r\nyou to Mrs. Sigsbee H. Waddington. And may the Lord have mercy on your\r\nsoul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hamilton! To-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to-night. I am lecturing to the West Orange Daughters of Minerva\r\nto-night on The Modern Drama. Some other time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then to-night,\" said George, blushing faintly. \"I think I may as well\r\njust stroll round Seventy-Ninth Street way and--er--well, just stroll\r\nround.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the good of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can look at the house, can't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Young blood!\" said Hamilton Beamish indulgently. \"Young blood!\"\r\n\r\nHe poised himself firmly on his No-Jars, and swung the dumb-bell in a\r\nforceful arc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\n\"Mullett,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you pressed my dress clothes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And brushed them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"My ties--are they laid out?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a neat row, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge coughed.\r\n\r\n\"Mullett!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You recollect the little chat we were having just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"About the young lady I--er....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand you have seen her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a glimpse, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge coughed again.\r\n\r\n\"Ah--rather attractive, Mullett, didn't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Extremely, sir. Very cuddly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The exact adjective I would have used myself, Mullett!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cuddly! A beautiful word.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge coughed for the third time.\r\n\r\n\"A lozenge, sir?\" said Mullett solicitously.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mullett!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I find that Mr. Beamish is an intimate friend of this young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy that, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is going to introduce me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very gratifying, I am sure, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge sighed dreamily.\r\n\r\n\"Life is very sweet, Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"For those that like it, sir,--yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lead me to the ties,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nAt the hour of seven-thirty, just when George Finch was trying out his\r\nfifth tie, a woman stood pacing the floor in the Byzantine boudoir at\r\nNumber 16, Seventy-Ninth Street, East.\r\n\r\nAt first sight this statement may seem contradictory. Is it possible,\r\nthe captious critic may ask, for a person simultaneously to stand\r\nand pace the floor? The answer is Yes, if he or she is sufficiently\r\nagitated as to the soul. You do it by placing yourself on a given spot\r\nand scrabbling the feet alternately like a cat kneading a hearth-rug.\r\nIt is sometimes the only method by which strong women can keep from\r\nhaving hysterics.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sigsbee H. Waddington was a strong woman. In fact, so commanding\r\nwas her physique that a stranger might have supposed her to be one in\r\nthe technical, or circus, sense. She was not tall, but had bulged so\r\ngenerously in every possible direction that, when seen for the first\r\ntime, she gave the impression of enormous size. No theatre, however\r\nlittle its programme had managed to attract the public, could be said\r\nto be \"sparsely filled\" if Mrs. Waddington had dropped in to look at\r\nthe show. Public speakers, when Mrs. Waddington was present, had the\r\nillusion that they were addressing most of the population of the\r\nUnited States. And when she went to Carlsbad or Aix-les-Bains to take\r\nthe waters, the authorities huddled together nervously and wondered if\r\nthere would be enough to go round.\r\n\r\nHer growing bulk was a perpetual sorrow--one of many--to her husband.\r\nWhen he had married her, she had been slim and _svelte_. But she\r\nhad also been the relict of the late P. Homer Horlick, the Cheese King,\r\nand he had left her several million dollars. Most of the interest\r\naccruing from this fortune she had, so it sometimes seemed to Sigsbee\r\nH. Waddington, spent on starchy foods.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington stood and paced the floor, and presently the door\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Hunstanton,\" announced Ferris, the butler.\r\n\r\nThe standard of male looks presented up to the present in this story\r\nhas not been high: but the man who now entered did much to raise the\r\naverage. He was tall and slight and elegant, with frank blue eyes--one\r\nof them preceded by an eye-glass--and one of those clipped moustaches.\r\nHis clothes had been cut by an inspired tailor and pressed by a genius.\r\nHis tie was simply an ethereal white butterfly, straight from heaven,\r\nthat hovered over the collar-stud as if it were sipping pollen from\r\nsome exotic flower. (George Finch, now working away at number eight and\r\nhaving just got it creased in four places, would have screamed hoarsely\r\nwith envy at the sight of that tie.)\r\n\r\n\"Well, here I am,\" said Lord Hunstanton. He paused for a moment, then\r\nadded, \"What, what!\" as if he felt that it was expected of him.\r\n\r\n\"It was so kind of you to come,\" said Mrs. Waddington, pivoting on her\r\naxis and panting like a hart after the water-brooks.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew I could rely on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have only to command.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're such a true friend, though I have known you only such a short\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is anything wrong?\" asked Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\nHe was more than a little surprised to find himself at seven-forty\r\nin a house where he had been invited to dine at half-past eight.\r\nHis dressing had been interrupted by a telephone-call from Mrs.\r\nWaddington's butler, begging him to come round at once: and, noting\r\nhis hostess's agitation, he hoped that nothing had gone wonky with the\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is wrong!\"\r\n\r\nLord Hunstanton sighed inaudibly. Did this mean cold meat and a pickle?\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee is having one of his spells!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean he has been taken ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not ill. Fractious.\" Mrs. Waddington gulped. \"It's so awful that\r\nthis should have occurred on the night of an important dinner-party,\r\nafter you have taken such trouble with his education. I have said a\r\nhundred times that, since you came, Sigsbee has been a different man.\r\nHe knows all the forks now, and can even talk intelligently about\r\n_soufflés_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only too glad if any little pointers I have been able to....\"\r\n\r\n\"And when I take him out for a run he always walks on the outside\r\nof the pavement. And here he must go, on the night of my biggest\r\ndinner-party, and have one of his spells.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the trouble? Is he violent?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Sullen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington's mouth set in a hard line.\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee is pining for the West again!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, he's pining for the great wide open spaces of the West. He\r\nsays the East is effete and he wants to be out there among the silent\r\ncanyons where men are men. If you want to know what I think, somebody's\r\nbeen feeding him Zane Grey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can nothing be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--in time, I can get him right if I'm given time, by stopping\r\nhis pocket-money. But I need time, and here he is, an hour before my\r\nimportant dinner, with some of the most wealthy and exclusive people in\r\nNew York expected at any moment, refusing to put on his dress clothes\r\nand saying that all a man that is a man needs is to shoot his bison and\r\ncut off a steak and cook it by the light of the western stars. And what\r\nI want to know is, what am I to do?\"\r\n\r\nLord Hunstanton twisted his moustache thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Very perplexing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought if you went and had a word with him....\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if it would do any good. I suppose you couldn't dine without\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would make us thirteen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\" His Lordship's face brightened. \"I've got it! Send Miss\r\nWaddington to reason with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Molly? You think he would listen to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is very fond of her.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington reflected.\r\n\r\n\"It's worth trying. I'll go up and see if she is dressed. She is a dear\r\ngirl, isn't she, Lord Hunstanton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charming, charming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I'm as fond of her as if she were my own daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Though, of course, dearly as I love her, I am never foolishly\r\nindulgent. So many girls to-day are spoiled by foolish indulgence.\"\r\n\r\n\"True.\"\r\n\r\n\"My great wish, Lord Hunstanton, is one day to see her happily married\r\nto some good man.\"\r\n\r\nHis lordship closed the door behind Mrs. Waddington and stood for some\r\nmoments in profound thought. He may have been wondering what was the\r\nearliest he could expect a cocktail, or he may have been musing on some\r\ndeeper subject--if there is a deeper subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington navigated upstairs, and paused before a door near the\r\nsecond landing.\r\n\r\n\"Molly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington was frowning as she entered the room. How often she had\r\ntold this girl to call her \"mater\"!\r\n\r\nBut this was a small point, and not worth mentioning at a time like\r\nthe present. She sank into a chair with a creaking groan. Strong woman\r\nthough she was, Mrs. Sigsbee Waddington, like the chair, was near to\r\nbreaking down.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, mother! What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Send her away,\" muttered Mrs. Waddington, nodding at her\r\nstepdaughter's maid.\r\n\r\n\"All right, mother. I shan't want you any more, Julie. I can manage\r\nnow. Shall I get you a glass of water, mother?\"\r\n\r\nMolly looked at her suffering stepparent with gentle concern,\r\nwishing that she had something stronger than water to offer. But her\r\nlate mother had brought her up in that silly, stuffy way in which\r\nold-fashioned mothers used to bring up their daughters: and, incredible\r\nas it may seem in these enlightened days, Molly Waddington had reached\r\nthe age of twenty without forming even a nodding acquaintance with\r\nalcohol. Now, no doubt, as she watched her stepmother gulping before\r\nher like a moose that has had trouble in the home, she regretted that\r\nshe was not one of those sensible modern girls who always carry a\r\ncouple of shots around with them in a jewelled flask.\r\n\r\nBut, though a defective upbringing kept her from being useful in this\r\ncrisis, nobody could deny that, as she stood there half-dressed for\r\ndinner, Molly Waddington was extremely ornamental. If George Finch\r\ncould have seen her at that moment.... But then if George Finch had\r\nseen her at that moment, he would immediately have shut his eyes like a\r\ngentleman: for there was that about her costume, in its present stage\r\nof development, which was not for the male gaze.\r\n\r\nStill, however quickly he had shut his eyes, he could not have shut\r\nthem rapidly enough to keep from seeing that Mullett, in his recent\r\nremarks on an absorbing subject, had shown an even nicer instinct\r\nfor the _mot juste_ than he had supposed. Beyond all chance for\r\nevasion or doubt, Molly Waddington was cuddly. She was wearing primrose\r\nknickers, and her silk-stockinged legs tapered away to little gold\r\nshoes. Her pink fingers were clutching at a blue dressing-jacket with\r\nswan's-down trimming. Her bobbed hair hung about a round little face\r\nwith a tip-tilted little nose. Her eyes were large, her teeth small\r\nand white and even. She had a little brown mole on the back of her\r\nneck and--in short, to sum the whole thing up, if George Finch could\r\nhave caught even the briefest glimpse of her at this juncture, he must\r\ninevitably have fallen over sideways, yapping like a dog.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington's breathing had become easier, and she was sitting up\r\nin her chair with something like the old imperiousness.\r\n\r\n\"Molly,\" said Mrs. Waddington, \"have you been giving your father Zane\r\nGrey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite. I don't think there's any Zane Grey in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he's been sneaking out and seeing Tom Mix again,\" said Mrs.\r\nWaddington.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! He's got one of his spells.\"\r\n\r\n\"A bad one?\"\r\n\r\n\"So bad that he refuses to dress for dinner. He says that if the\r\nboys\"--Mrs. Waddington shuddered--\"if the boys don't like him in a\r\nflannel shirt, he won't come in to dinner at all. And Lord Hunstanton\r\nsuggested that I should send you to reason with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Hunstanton? Has he arrived already?\"\r\n\r\n\"I telephoned for him. I am coming to rely on Lord Hunstanton more and\r\nmore every day. What a dear fellow he is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Molly, a little dubiously. She was not fond of his lordship.\r\n\r\n\"So handsome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such breeding.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be very happy,\" said Mrs. Waddington, \"if a man like Lord\r\nHunstanton asked you to be his wife.\"\r\n\r\nMolly fiddled with the trimming of her dressing-jacket. This was not\r\nthe first time the subject had come up between her stepmother and\r\nherself. A remark like the one just recorded was Mrs. Waddington's idea\r\nof letting fall a quiet hint.\r\n\r\n\"Well....\" said Molly.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't you think he's rather stiff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stiff!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you find him a little starchy?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean that Lord Hunstanton's manners are perfect, I agree with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure that I like a man's manners to be too perfect,\"\r\nsaid Molly meditatively. \"Don't you think a shy man can be rather\r\nattractive?\" She scraped the toe of one gold shoe against the heel of\r\nthe other. \"The sort of man I think I should rather like,\" she said,\r\na dreamy look in her eyes, \"would be a sort of slimmish, smallish man\r\nwith nice brown eyes and rather gold-y, chestnutty hair, who kind of\r\nlooks at you from a distance because he's too shy to speak to you and,\r\nwhen he does get a chance to speak to you, sort of chokes and turns\r\npink and twists his fingers and makes funny noises and trips over his\r\nfeet and looks rather a lamb and....\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington had risen from her chair like a storm-cloud brooding\r\nover a country-side.\r\n\r\n\"Molly!\" she cried. \"Who is this young man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, nobody of course! Just some one I sort of imagined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mrs. Waddington, relieved. \"You spoke as if you knew him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a strange idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"If any young man ever does look at you and make funny noises, you will\r\nignore him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington started.\r\n\r\n\"All this nonsense you have been talking has made me forget about your\r\nfather. Put on your dress and go down to him at once. Reason with him!\r\nIf he refuses to come in to dinner, we shall be thirteen, and my party\r\nwill be ruined.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be ready in a couple of minutes. Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the library.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be right down.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, when you have seen him, go into the drawing-room and talk to\r\nLord Hunstanton. He is all alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mater,\" said Molly.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those nice, dutiful girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a nice, dutiful girl, Molly Waddington was also a\r\npersuasive, wheedling girl. Better proof of this statement can hardly\r\nbe afforded than by the fact that, as the clocks were pointing to ten\r\nminutes past eight, a red-faced little man with stiff grey hair and a\r\nsulky face shambled down the stairs of Number 16, East Seventy-Ninth\r\nStreet, and, pausing in the hall, subjected Ferris, the butler, to an\r\noffensive glare. It was Sigsbee H. Waddington, fully, if sloppily,\r\ndressed in the accepted mode of gentlemen of social standing about to\r\ndine.\r\n\r\nThe details of any record performance are always interesting, so it may\r\nbe mentioned that Molly had reached the library at seven minutes to\r\neight. She had started wheedling at exactly six minutes and forty-five\r\nseconds to the hour. At seven fifty-four Sigsbee Waddington had begun\r\nto weaken. At seven fifty-seven he was fighting in the last ditch: and\r\nat seven fifty-nine, vowing he would ne'er consent, he consented.\r\n\r\nInto the arguments used by Molly we need not enter fully. It is enough\r\nto say that, if a man loves his daughter dearly, and if she comes to\r\nhim and says that she has been looking forward to a certain party\r\nand is wearing a new dress for that party, and if, finally, she adds\r\nthat, should he absent himself from that party, the party and her\r\npleasure will be ruined,--then, unless the man has a heart of stone,\r\nhe will give in. Sigsbee Waddington had not a heart of stone. Many\r\ngood judges considered that he had a head of concrete, but nobody had\r\never disparaged his heart. At eight precisely he was in his bedroom,\r\nshovelling on his dress clothes: and now, at ten minutes past, he stood\r\nin the hall and looked disparagingly at Ferris.\r\n\r\nSigsbee Waddington thought Ferris was an over-fed wart.\r\n\r\nFerris thought Sigsbee Waddington ought to be ashamed to appear in\r\npublic in a tie like that.\r\n\r\nBut thoughts are not words. What Ferris actually said was:\r\n\r\n\"A cocktail, sir?\"\r\n\r\nAnd what Sigsbee Waddington actually said was:\r\n\r\n\"Yup! Gimme!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Mr. Waddington still unsoothed, continued to\r\nglower. Ferris, resuming his marmoreal calm, had begun to muse\r\nonce more, as was his habit when in thought, on Brangmarley Hall,\r\nLittle-Seeping-in-the-Wold, Salop, Eng., where he had spent the early,\r\nhappy days of his butlerhood.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris!\" said Mr. Waddington at length.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ever been out West, Ferris?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ever want to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" demanded Mr. Waddington belligerently.\r\n\r\n\"I understand that in the Western States of America, sir, there is a\r\ncertain lack of comfort, and the social amenities are not rigorously\r\nobserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gangway!\" said Mr. Waddington, making for the front door.\r\n\r\nHe felt stifled. He wanted air. He yearned, if only for a few brief\r\ninstants, to be alone with the silent stars.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to deny that, at this particular moment, Sigsbee H.\r\nWaddington was in a dangerous mood. The history of nations shows that\r\nthe wildest upheavals come from those peoples that have been most\r\nrigorously oppressed: and it is so with individuals. There is no man\r\nso terrible in his spasmodic fury as the hen-pecked husband during his\r\nshort spasms of revolt. Even Mrs. Waddington recognised that, no matter\r\nhow complete her control normally, Sigsbee H., when having one of his\r\nspells, practically amounted to a rogue elephant. Her policy was to\r\nkeep out of his way till the fever passed, and then to discipline him\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nAs Sigsbee Waddington stood on the pavement outside his house, drinking\r\nin the dust-and-gasolene mixture which passes for air in New York and\r\nscanning the weak imitation stars which are the best the East provides,\r\nhe was grim and squiggle-eyed and ripe for murders, stratagems and\r\nspoils. Molly's statement that there was no Zane Grey in the house had\r\nbeen very far from the truth. Sigsbee Waddington had his private store,\r\nlocked away in a secret cupboard, and since early morning \"Riders of\r\nthe Purple Sage\" had hardly ever been out of his hand. During the\r\nafternoon, moreover, he had managed to steal away to a motion-picture\r\nhouse on Sixth Avenue where they were presenting Henderson Hoover\r\nand Sara Svelte in \"That L'il Gal from the Bar B. Ranch.\" Sigsbee\r\nWaddington, as he stood on the pavement, was clad in dress clothes and\r\nlooked like a stage waiter, but at heart he was wearing chaps and a\r\nStetson hat and people spoke of him as Two-Gun Thomas.\r\n\r\nA Rolls-Royce drew up at the kerb, and Mr. Waddington moved a step\r\nor two away. A fat man alighted and helped his fatter wife out. Mr.\r\nWaddington recognised them. B. and Mrs. Brewster Bodthorne. B. Brewster\r\nwas the first vice-president of Amalgamated Tooth-Brushes, and rolled\r\nin money.\r\n\r\n\"Pah!\" muttered Mr. Waddington, sickened to the core.\r\n\r\nThe pair vanished into the house, and presently another Rolls-Royce\r\narrived, followed by a Hispano-Suiza. Consolidated Pop-corn and wife\r\nemerged, and then United Beef and daughter. A consignment worth on the\r\nhoof between eighty and a hundred million.\r\n\r\n\"How long?\" moaned Mr. Waddington. \"How long?\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the door closed, he was aware of a young man behaving\r\nstrangely on the pavement some few feet away from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nThe reason why George Finch--for it was he--was behaving strangely\r\nwas that he was a shy young man and consequently unable to govern\r\nhis movements by the light of pure reason. The ordinary tough-skinned\r\neveryday young fellow with a face of brass and the placid gall of an\r\nArmy mule would, of course, if he had decided to pay a call upon a girl\r\nin order to make inquiries about her dog, have gone right ahead and\r\ndone it. He would have shot his cuffs and straightened his tie, and\r\nthen trotted up the steps and punched the front-door bell. Not so the\r\ndiffident George.\r\n\r\nGeorge's methods were different. Graceful and, in their way, pretty to\r\nwatch, but different. First, he stood for some moments on one foot,\r\nstaring at the house. Then, as if some friendly hand had dug three\r\ninches of a meat-skewer into the flesh of his leg, he shot forward in\r\na spasmodic bound. Checking this as he reached the steps, he retreated\r\na pace or two and once more became immobile. A few moments later, the\r\nmeat-skewer had got to work again and he had sprung up the steps, only\r\nto leap backwards once more on to the side-walk.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Waddington first made up his mind to accost him, he had begun\r\nto walk round in little circles, mumbling to himself.\r\n\r\nSigsbee Waddington was in no mood for this sort of thing. It was the\r\nsort of thing, he felt bitterly, which could happen only in this\r\ndegraded East. Out West, men are men and do not dance tangoes by\r\nthemselves on front door-steps. Venters, the hero of \"Riders of the\r\nPurple Sage,\" he recalled, had been described by the author as standing\r\n\"tall and straight, his wide shoulders flung back, with the muscles\r\nof his arms rippling and a blue flame of defiance in his gaze.\" How\r\ndifferent, felt Mr. Waddington, from this imbecile young man who seemed\r\ncontent to waste life's springtime playing solitary round-games in the\r\npublic streets.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" he said sharply.\r\n\r\nThe exclamation took George amidships just as he had returned to the\r\nstanding-on-one-leg position. It caused him to lose his balance, and\r\nif he had not adroitly clutched Mr. Waddington by the left ear, it is\r\nprobable that he would have fallen.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" said George, having sorted himself out.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of being sorry?\" growled the injured man, tenderly\r\nfeeling his ear. \"And what the devil are you doing anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just paying a call,\" explained George.\r\n\r\n\"Doing a what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm paying a formal call at this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which house?\"\r\n\r\n\"This one. Number sixteen. Waddington, Sigsbee H.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington regarded him with unconcealed hostility.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are, are you? Well, it may interest you to learn that I am\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington, and I don't know you from Adam. So now!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge gasped.\r\n\r\n\"You are Sigsbee H. Waddington?\" he said reverently.\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was gazing at Molly's father as at some beautiful work of art--a\r\nsuperb painting, let us say--the sort of thing which connoisseurs\r\nfight for and which finally gets knocked down to Dr. Rosenbach for\r\nthree hundred thousand dollars. Which will give the reader a rough idea\r\nof what love can do: for, considered in a calm and unbiased spirit,\r\nSigsbee Waddington was little, if anything, to look at.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Waddington,\" said George, \"I am proud to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Proud to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\" said Sigsbee Waddington churlishly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Waddington,\" said George, \"I was born in Idaho.\"\r\n\r\nMuch has been written of the sedative effect of pouring oil on the\r\nraging waters of the ocean, and it is on record that the vision of the\r\nHoly Grail, sliding athwart a rainbow, was generally sufficient to\r\nstill the most fiercely warring passions of young knights in the Middle\r\nAges. But never since history began can there have been so sudden a\r\nchange from red-eyed hostility to smiling benevolence as occurred now\r\nin Sigsbee H. Waddington. As George's words, like some magic spell,\r\nfell upon his ears, he forgot that one of those ears was smarting\r\nbadly as the result of the impulsive clutch of this young man before\r\nhim. Wrath melted from his soul like dew from a flower beneath the sun.\r\nHe beamed on George. He pawed George's sleeve with a paternal hand.\r\n\r\n\"You really come from the West?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"From God's own country? From the great wonderful West with its wide\r\nopen spaces where a red-blooded man can fill his lungs with the breath\r\nof freedom?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not precisely the way George would have described East Gilead,\r\nwhich was a stuffy little hamlet with a poorish water-supply and one of\r\nthe worst soda-fountains in Idaho, but he nodded amiably.\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington dashed a hand across his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The West! Why, it's like a mother to me! I love every flower that\r\nblooms on the broad bosom of its sweeping plains, every sun-kissed peak\r\nof its everlasting hills.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge said he did, too.\r\n\r\n\"Its beautiful valleys, mystic in their transparent, luminous gloom,\r\nweird in the quivering, golden haze of the lightning that flickers over\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"The dark spruces tipped with glimmering lights! The aspens bent low in\r\nthe wind, like waves in a tempest at sea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you beat them!\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"The forest of oaks tossing wildly and shining with gleams of fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"What could be sweeter?\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen,\" said Mr. Waddington, \"you and I must see more of each\r\nother. Come and have a bite of dinner!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right this very minute. We've got a few of these puny-souled Eastern\r\nmillionaires putting on the nose-bag with us to-night, but you won't\r\nmind them. We'll just look at 'em and despise 'em. And after dinner,\r\nyou and I will slip off to my study and have a good chat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But won't Mrs. Waddington object to an unexpected guest at the last\r\nmoment?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington expanded his chest, and tapped it spaciously.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen--what's your name?--Finch?--Say, listen, Finch, do I look\r\nlike the sort of man who's bossed by his wife?\"\r\n\r\nIt was precisely the sort of man that George thought he did look like,\r\nbut this was not the moment to say so.\r\n\r\n\"It's very kind of you,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Kind? Say, listen, if I was riding along those illimitable prairies\r\nand got storm-bound outside your ranch at East Gilead, you wouldn't\r\nworry about whether you were being kind when you asked me in for a\r\nbite, would you? You'd say, 'Step right in, pardner! The place is\r\nyours.' Very well, then!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington produced a latch-key.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris,\" said Mr. Waddington in the hall, \"tell those galoots down in\r\nthe kitchen to set another place at table. A pard of mine from the West\r\nhas happened in for a snack.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nThe perfect hostess makes a point of never displaying discomposure. In\r\nmoments of trial she aims at the easy repose of manner of a Red Indian\r\nat the stake. Nevertheless, there was a moment when, as she saw Sigsbee\r\nH. caracole into the drawing-room with George and heard him announce in\r\na ringing voice that this fine young son of the western prairies had\r\ncome to take pot-luck, Mrs. Waddington indisputably reeled.\r\n\r\nShe recovered herself. All the woman in her was urging her to take\r\nSigsbee H. by his outstanding ears and shake him till he came unstuck,\r\nbut she fought the emotion down. Gradually her glazed eye lost its\r\ndead-fishy look. Like Death in the poem, she 'grinned horrible a\r\nghastly smile.' And it was with a well-assumed graciousness that she\r\neventually extended to George the quivering right hand which, had she\r\nbeen a less highly civilised woman, would about now have been landing\r\non the side of her husband's head, swung from the hip.\r\n\r\n\"Chahmed!\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"So very, very glad that you were able\r\nto come, Mr.----\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, and George, eyeing her mistily, gathered that she wished\r\nto be informed of his name. He would have been glad to supply the\r\ninformation, but unfortunately at the moment he had forgotten it\r\nhimself. He had a dim sort of idea that it began with an F or a G, but\r\nbeyond that his mind was a blank.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that, in the act of shaking hands with his hostess, George\r\nFinch had caught sight of Molly, and the spectacle had been a little\r\ntoo much for him.\r\n\r\nMolly was wearing the new evening dress of which she had spoken so\r\nfeelingly to her father at their recent interview, and it seemed to\r\nGeorge as if the scales had fallen from his eyes and he was seeing her\r\nfor the first time. Before, in a vague way he had supposed that she\r\npossessed arms and shoulders and hair, but it was only at this moment\r\nthat he perceived how truly these arms and those shoulders and that\r\nhair were arms and shoulders and hair in the deepest and holiest sense\r\nof the words. It was as if a goddess had thrown aside the veil. It\r\nwas as if a statue had come to life. It was as if ... well, the point\r\nwe are trying to make is that George Finch was impressed. His eyes\r\nenlarged to the dimensions of saucers; the tip of his nose quivered\r\nlike a rabbit's: and unseen hands began to pour iced water down his\r\nspine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington, having given him a long, steady look that blistered\r\nhis forehead, turned away and began to talk to a soda-water magnate.\r\nShe had no real desire to ascertain George's name, though she would\r\nhave read it with pleasure on a tombstone.\r\n\r\n\"Dinner is served,\" announced Ferris, the butler, appearing noiselessly\r\nlike a Djinn summoned by the rubbing of a lamp.\r\n\r\nGeorge found himself swept up in the stampede of millionaires. He was\r\nstill swallowing feebly.\r\n\r\nThere are few things more embarrassing to a shy and sensitive young\r\nman than to be present at a dinner-party where something seems to tell\r\nhim he is not really wanted. The something that seemed to tell George\r\nFinch he was not really wanted at to-night's festive gathering was\r\nMrs. Waddington's eye, which kept shooting down the table at intervals\r\nand reducing him to pulp at those very moments when he was beginning\r\nto feel that, if treated with gentle care and kindness, he might\r\neventually recover.\r\n\r\nIt was an eye that, like a thermos flask, could be alternately\r\nextremely hot and intensely cold. When George met it during the\r\nsoup course he had the feeling of having encountered a simoom while\r\njourneying across an African desert. When, on the other hand, it\r\nsniped him as he toyed with his fish, his sensations were those of a\r\nsearcher for the Pole who unexpectedly bumps into a blizzard. But,\r\nwhether it was cold or hot, there was always in Mrs. Waddington's gaze\r\none constant factor--a sort of sick loathing which nothing that he\r\ncould ever do, George felt, would have the power to allay. It was the\r\nkind of look which Sisera might have surprised in the eye of Jael the\r\nwife of Heber, had he chanced to catch it immediately before she began\r\noperations with the spike. George had made one new friend that night,\r\nbut not two.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that as regards George Finch's contribution to the\r\nfeast of wit and flow of soul at that dinner-party we have nothing to\r\nreport. He uttered no epigrams. He told no good stories. Indeed, the\r\nonly time he spoke at all was when he said 'Sherry' to the footman when\r\nhe meant 'Hock.'\r\n\r\nEven, however, had the conditions been uniformly pleasant, it is to\r\nbe doubted whether he would have really dominated the gathering.\r\nMrs. Waddington, in her selection of guests, confined herself to the\r\nextremely wealthy: and, while the conversation of the extremely wealthy\r\nis fascinating in its way, it tends to be a little too technical for\r\nthe average man.\r\n\r\nWith the soup, some one who looked like a cartoon of Capital in a\r\nSocialistic paper said he was glad to see that Westinghouse Common were\r\nbuoyant again. A man who might have been his brother agreed that they\r\nhad firmed up nicely at closing. Whereas Wabash Pref. A., falling to\r\n73-7/8, caused shakings of the head. However, one rather liked the look\r\nof Royal Dutch Oil Ordinaries at 54-3/4.\r\n\r\nWith the fish, United Beef began to tell a neat though rather long,\r\nstory about the Bolivian Land Concession, the gist of which was that\r\nthe Bolivian Oil and Land Syndicate, acquiring from the Bolivian\r\nGovernment the land and prospecting concessions of Bolivia, would be\r\nknown as Bolivian Concessions, Ld, and would have a capital of one\r\nmillion dollars in two hundred thousand five-dollar \"A\" shares and two\r\nhundred thousand half-dollar \"B\" shares, and that while no cash payment\r\nwas to be made to the vendor syndicate the latter was being allotted\r\nthe whole of the \"B\" shares as consideration for the concession.\r\nAnd--this was where the raconteur made his point--the \"B\" shares were\r\nto receive half the divisible profits and to rank equal with the \"A\"\r\nshares in any distribution of assets.\r\n\r\nThe story went well, and conversation became general. There was a\r\ncertain amount of good-natured chaff about the elasticity of the form\r\nof credit handled by the Commercial Banks, and once somebody raised a\r\nlaugh with a sly retort about the Reserve against Circulation and Total\r\nDeposits. On the question of the collateral liability of shareholders,\r\nhowever, argument ran high, and it was rather a relief when, as tempers\r\nbegan to get a little heated, Mrs. Waddington gave the signal and the\r\nwomen left the table.\r\n\r\nCoffee having been served and cigars lighted, the magnates drew\r\ntogether at the end of the table where Mr. Waddington sat. But Mr.\r\nWaddington, adroitly sidestepping, left them and came down to George.\r\n\r\n\"Out West,\" said Mr. Waddington in a rumbling undertone, malevolently\r\neyeing Amalgamated Tooth-Brushes, who had begun to talk about the\r\nMid-Continent Fiduciary Conference at St. Louis, \"they would shoot at\r\nthat fellow's feet.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge agreed that such behaviour could reflect nothing but credit on\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\n\"These Easterners make me tired,\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\nGeorge confessed to a similar fatigue.\r\n\r\n\"When you think that at this very moment out in Utah and Arizona,\" said\r\nMr. Waddington, \"strong men are packing their saddle-bags and making\r\nthem secure with their lassoes you kind of don't know whether to laugh\r\nor cry, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the very problem,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen,\" said Mr. Waddington, \"I'll just push these pot-bellied\r\nguys off upstairs, and then you and I will sneak off to my study and\r\nhave a real talk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nNothing spoils a _tête-à-tête_ chat between two newly-made\r\nfriends more than a disposition towards reticence on the part of the\r\nsenior of the pair: and it was fortunate therefore, that, by the time\r\nhe found himself seated opposite to George in his study, the heady\r\ninfluence of Zane Grey and the rather generous potations in which he\r\nhad indulged during dinner had brought Sigsbee H. Waddington to quite a\r\nreasonably communicative mood. He had reached the stage when men talk\r\ndisparagingly about their wives. He tapped George on the knee, informed\r\nhim three times that he liked his face, and began.\r\n\r\n\"You married, Winch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Finch,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean, Finch?\" asked Mr. Waddington, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You called me Winch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you thought it was my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Winch.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said just now it was Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is. I was saying....\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington tapped him on the knee once more.\r\n\r\n\"Young man,\" he said, \"pull yourself together. If your name is Finch,\r\nwhy pretend that it is Winch? I don't like this shiftiness. It does\r\nnot come well from a Westerner. Leave this petty shilly-shallying\r\nto Easterners like that vile rabble of widow-and-orphan oppressors\r\nupstairs, all of whom have got incipient Bright's Disease. If your\r\nname is Pinch, admit it like a man. Let your yea be yea and your nay\r\nbe nay,\" said Mr. Waddington a little severely, holding a match to the\r\nfountain-pen which, as will happen to the best of us in moments of\r\nemotion, he had mistaken for his cigar.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I'm not,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Not what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Married.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never said you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"You asked me if I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure of that?\" said Mr. Waddington keenly.\r\n\r\n\"Quite. Just after we sat down, you asked me if I was married.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your reply was...?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Now we have got it straight at last,\" he said, \"and why you beat\r\nabout the bush like that, I cannot imagine. Well, what I say to\r\nyou, Pinch--and I say it very seriously as an older, wiser, and\r\nbetter-looking man--is this.\" Mr. Waddington drew thoughtfully at the\r\nfountain-pen for a moment. \"I say to you, Pinch, be very careful, when\r\nyou marry, that you have money of your own. And, having money of your\r\nown, keep it. Never be dependent on your wife for the occasional little\r\nsums which even the most prudent man requires to see him through the\r\nday. Take my case. When I married, I was a wealthy man. I had money of\r\nmy own. Lots of it. I was beloved by all, being generous to a fault. I\r\nbought my wife--I am speaking now of my first wife--a pearl necklace\r\nthat cost fifty thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nHe cocked a bright eye at George, and George, feeling that comment was\r\nrequired, said that it did him credit.\r\n\r\n\"Not credit,\" said Mr. Waddington. \"Cash. Cold cash. Fifty thousand\r\ndollars of it. And what happened? Shortly after I married again I lost\r\nall my money through unfortunate speculations on the Stock Exchange\r\nand became absolutely dependent on my second wife. And that is why\r\nyou see me to-day, Winch, a broken man. I will tell you something,\r\nPinch--something no one suspects and something which I have never told\r\nanybody else and wouldn't be telling you now if I didn't like your\r\nface.... I am not master in my own home!\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Not master in my own home. I want to live in the great, glorious\r\nWest, and my second wife insists on remaining in the soul-destroying\r\nEast. And I'll tell you something else.\" Mr. Waddington paused and\r\nscrutinised the fountain-pen with annoyance. \"This darned cigar won't\r\ndraw,\" he said petulantly.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's a fountain-pen,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"A fountain-pen?\" Mr. Waddington, shutting one eye, tested this\r\nstatement and found it correct. \"There!\" he said, with a certain moody\r\nsatisfaction. \"Isn't that typical of the East? You ask for cigars and\r\nthey sell you fountain-pens. No honesty, no sense of fair trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Waddington was looking very charming at dinner, I thought,\" said\r\nGeorge, timidly broaching the subject nearest his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Pinch,\" said Mr. Waddington, resuming his theme, \"my wife\r\noppresses me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How wonderfully that bobbed hair suits Miss Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know if you noticed a pie-faced fellow with an eye-glass and\r\na tooth-brush moustache at dinner? That was Lord Hunstanton. He keeps\r\ntelling me things about etiquette.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very kind of him,\" hazarded George.\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington eyed him in a manner that convinced him that he had said\r\nthe wrong thing.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, kind of him? It's officious and impertinent. He is\r\na pest,\" said Mr. Waddington. \"They wouldn't stand for him in Arizona.\r\nThey would put hydrophobia skunks in his bed. What does a man need with\r\netiquette? As long as a man is fearless and upstanding and can shoot\r\nstraight and look the world in the eye, what does it matter if he uses\r\nthe wrong fork?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or wears the wrong sort of hat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I particularly admired the hat which Miss Waddington was wearing when\r\nI first saw her,\" said George. \"It was of some soft material and of a\r\nlight brown colour and....\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife--I am still speaking of my second wife. My first, poor soul,\r\nis dead--sicks this Hunstanton guy on to me, and for financial\r\nreasons, darn it, I am unable to give him the good soak on the nose to\r\nwhich all my better instincts urge me. And guess what she's got into\r\nher head now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"She wants Molly to marry the fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not advise that,\" said George seriously. \"No, no, I am\r\nstrongly opposed to that. So many of these Anglo-American marriages\r\nturn out unhappily.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a man of broad sympathies and a very acute sensibility,\" began\r\nMr. Waddington, apropos, apparently, of nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said George, \"I did not like the man's looks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Hunstanton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk of that guy! He gives me a pain in the neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, too,\" said George. \"And I was saying....\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell you something?\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"My second wife--not my first--wants Molly to marry him. Did you notice\r\nhim at dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said George patiently. \"And I did not like his looks. He\r\nlooked to me cold and sinister, the sort of man who might break the\r\nheart of an impulsive young girl. What Miss Waddington wants, I feel\r\nconvinced, is a husband who would give up everything for her--a man who\r\nwould sacrifice his heart's desire to bring one smile to her face--a\r\nman who would worship her, set her in a shrine, make it his only aim\r\nin life to bring her sunshine and happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife,\" said Mr. Waddington, \"is much too stout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much too stout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Waddington, if I may say so, has a singularly beautiful figure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much starchy food, and no exercise--that's the trouble. What my\r\nwife needs is a year on a ranch, riding over the prairies in God's\r\nsunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I happened to catch sight of Miss Waddington the other day in riding\r\ncostume. I thought it suited her admirably. So many girls look awkward\r\nin riding-breeches, but Miss Waddington was charming. The costume\r\nseemed to accentuate what I might describe as that strange boyish\r\njauntiness of carriage which, to my mind, is one of Miss Waddington's\r\nchief....\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll have her doing it before long. As a married man, Winch--twice\r\nmarried, but my first wife, poor thing, passed away some years\r\nback--let me tell you something. To assert himself with his wife,\r\nto bend her to his will, if I may put it that way, a man needs\r\ncomplete financial independence. It is no use trying to bend your\r\nwife to your will when five minutes later you have got to try and\r\nwheedle twenty-five cents out of her for a cigar. Complete financial\r\nindependence is essential, Pinch, and that is what I am on the eve\r\nof achieving. Some little time back, having raised a certain sum of\r\nmoney--we need not go into the methods which I employed to do so--I\r\nbought a large block of stock in a Hollywood Motion Picture Company.\r\nHave you ever heard of the Finer and Better Motion Picture Company of\r\nHollywood, Cal.? Let me tell you that you will. It is going to be big,\r\nand I shall very shortly make an enormous fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking of the motion-pictures,\" said George, \"I do not deny that many\r\nof the women engaged in that industry are superficially attractive, but\r\nwhat I do maintain is that they lack Miss Waddington's intense purity\r\nof expression. To me Miss Waddington seems like some....\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall clean up big. It is only a question of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first thing anyone would notice on seeing Miss Waddington....\"\r\n\r\n\"Thousands and thousands of dollars. And then....\"\r\n\r\n\"A poet has spoken of a young girl as 'standing with reluctant feet\r\nwhere the brook and river meet....'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't only meat. What causes the real trouble is the desserts. It\r\nstands to reason that if a woman insists on cramming herself with rich\r\nstuff like what we were having to-night she is bound to put on weight.\r\nIf I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times....\"\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Waddington was about to say for the hundred and first time\r\nmust remain one of the historic mysteries. For, even as he drew in\r\nbreath the better to say it, the door opened and a radiant vision\r\nappeared. Mr. Waddington stopped in mid-sentence, and George's heart\r\ndid three back-somersaults and crashed against his front teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Mother sent me down to see what had become of you,\" said Molly.\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington got about half-way towards a look of dignity.\r\n\r\n\"I am not aware, my dear child,\" he said, \"that anything has 'become of\r\nme.' I merely snatched the opportunity of having a quiet talk with this\r\nyoung friend of mine from the West.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can't have quiet talks with your young friends when you've\r\ngot a lot of important people to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Important people!\" Mr. Waddington snorted sternly. \"A bunch of\r\nsuper-fatted bits of bad news! In God's country they would be lynched\r\non sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Brewster Bodthorne has been asking for you particularly. He wants\r\nto play checkers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell,\" said Mr. Waddington, with the air of quoting something out of\r\nDante, \"is full of Brewster Bodthornes.\"\r\n\r\nMolly put her arms round her father's neck and kissed him fondly--a\r\nproceeding which drew from George a low, sharp howl of suffering like\r\nthe bubbling cry of some strong swimmer in his agony. There is a limit\r\nto what the flesh can bear.\r\n\r\n\"Darling, you must be good. Up you go at once and be very nice to\r\neverybody. I'll stay here and entertain Mr.----\"\r\n\r\n\"His name is Pinch,\" said Mr. Waddington, rising reluctantly and\r\nmaking for the door. \"I met him out on the side-walk where men are\r\nmen. Get him to tell you all about the West. I can't remember when\r\nI've ever heard a man talk so arrestingly. Mr. Winch has held me\r\nspell-bound. Positively spell-bound. And my name,\" he concluded, a\r\nlittle incoherently, groping for the door-handle, \"is Sigsbee Horatio\r\nWaddington and I don't care who knows it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nThe chief drawback to being a shy man is that in the actual crises\r\nof real life you are a very different person from the dashing and\r\nresourceful individual whom you have pictured in your solitary\r\nday-dreams. George Finch, finding himself in the position in which he\r\nhad so often yearned to be--alone with the girl he loved, felt as if\r\nhis true self had been suddenly withdrawn and an incompetent understudy\r\nsubstituted at the last moment.\r\n\r\nThe George with whom he was familiar in day-dreams was a splendid\r\nfellow--graceful, thoroughly at his ease, and full of the neatest sort\r\nof ingratiating conversation. He looked nice, and you could tell by the\r\nway he spoke that he was nice. Clever, beyond a doubt--you knew that at\r\nonce by his epigrams--but not clever in that repellant, cold-hearted\r\nmodern fashion: for, no matter how brilliantly his talk sparkled, it\r\nwas plain all the while that his heart was in the right place and that,\r\ndespite his wonderful gifts, there was not an atom of conceit in his\r\ncomposition. His eyes had an attractive twinkle: his mouth curved from\r\ntime to time in an alluring smile: his hands were cool and artistic:\r\nand his shirt-front did not bulge. George, in short, as he had imagined\r\nhimself in his day-dreams, was practically the answer to the Maiden's\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\nHow different was this loathly changeling who now stood on one leg in\r\nthe library of Number 16, Seventy-Ninth Street, East. In the first\r\nplace, the fellow had obviously not brushed his hair for several days.\r\nAlso, he had omitted to wash his hands, and something had caused them\r\nto swell up and turn scarlet. Furthermore, his trousers bagged at the\r\nknees: his tie was moving up towards his left ear: and his shirt-front\r\nprotruded hideously like the chest of a pouter pigeon. A noisome sight.\r\n\r\nStill, looks are not everything: and if this wretched creature had\r\nbeen able to talk one-tenth as well as the George of the day-dreams,\r\nsomething might yet have been saved out of the wreck. But the poor\r\nblister was inarticulate as well. All he seemed able to do was clear\r\nhis throat. And what nice girl's heart has ever been won by a series of\r\nroopy coughs?\r\n\r\nAnd he could not even achieve a reasonable satisfactory expression.\r\nWhen he tried to relax his features (such as they were) into a charming\r\nsmile, he merely grinned weakly. When he forced himself not to grin,\r\nhis face froze into a murderous scowl.\r\n\r\nBut it was his inability to speak that was searing George's soul.\r\nActually, since the departure of Mr. Waddington, the silence had lasted\r\nfor perhaps six seconds: but to George Finch it seemed like a good\r\nhour. He goaded himself to utterance.\r\n\r\n\"My name,\" said George, speaking in a low, husky voice, \"is not Pinch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it?\" said the girl. \"How jolly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor Winch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better still.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Finch. George Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid!\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed genuinely pleased. She beamed upon him as if he had brought\r\nher good news from a distant land.\r\n\r\n\"Your father,\" proceeded George, not having anything to add by way of\r\ndevelopment of the theme but unable to abandon it, \"thought it was\r\nPinch. Or Winch. But it is not. It is Finch.\"\r\n\r\nHis eye, roaming nervously about the room, caught hers for an instant:\r\nand he was amazed to perceive that there was in it nothing of that\r\nstunned abhorrence which he felt his appearance and behaviour should\r\nrightly have aroused in any nice-minded girl. Astounding though it\r\nseemed, she appeared to be looking at him in a sort of pleased,\r\nmaternal way, as if he were a child she was rather fond of. For the\r\nfirst time a faint far-off glimmer of light shone upon George's\r\ndarkness. It would be too much to say that he was encouraged, but out\r\nof the night that covered him, black as the pit from pole to pole,\r\nthere did seem to sparkle for an instant a solitary star.\r\n\r\n\"How did you come to know father?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge could answer that. He was all right if you asked him questions.\r\nIt was the having to invent topics of conversation that baffled him.\r\n\r\n\"I met him outside the house: and when he found that I came from the\r\nWest he asked me in to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean he rushed at you and grabbed you as you were walking by?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. I wasn't walking by. I was--er--sort of standing on the\r\ndoor-step. At least....\"\r\n\r\n\"Standing on the door-step? Why?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge's ears turned a riper red.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was--er--coming as it were, to pay a call.\"\r\n\r\n\"A call?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"On mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"On you.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's eyes widened.\r\n\r\n\"On me?\"\r\n\r\n\"To make inquiries.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought--result of the excitement--and nerve-strain--I thought\r\nhe might be upset.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he ran away, do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You thought he would have a nervous break-down because he ran away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous traffic,\" explained George. \"Might have been run over.\r\nReaction. Nervous collapse.\"\r\n\r\nWoman's intuition is a wonderful thing. There was probably not an\r\nalienist in the land who, having listened so far, would not have sprung\r\nat George and held him down with one hand while with the other he\r\nsigned the necessary certificate of lunacy. But Molly Waddington saw\r\ndeeper into the matter. She was touched. As she realised that this\r\nyoung man thought so highly of her that, despite his painful shyness,\r\nhe was prepared to try to worm his way into her house on an excuse\r\nwhich even he must have recognised as pure banana-oil, her heart warmed\r\nto him. More than ever, she became convinced that George was a lamb\r\nand that she wanted to stroke his head and straighten his tie and make\r\ncooing noises to him.\r\n\r\n\"How very sweet of you,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Fond of dogs,\" mumbled George.\r\n\r\n\"You must be fond of dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you fond of dogs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm very fond of dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I. Very fond of dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Very fond of dogs. Some people are not fond of dogs, but I am.\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly eloquence descended upon George Finch. With gleaming\r\neyes he broke out into a sort of Litany. He began to talk easily and\r\nfluently.\r\n\r\n\"I am fond of Airedales and wire-haired terriers and bull-dogs and\r\nPekingese and Sealyhams and Alsations and fox-terriers and greyhounds\r\nand Aberdeens and West Highlands and Cairns and Pomeranians and\r\nspaniels and schipperkes and pugs and Maltese and Yorkshires and\r\nborzois and bloodhounds and Bedlingtons and pointers and setters\r\nand mastiffs and Newfoundlands and St. Bernards and Great Danes and\r\ndachshunds and collies and chows and poodles and....\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Molly. \"You're fond of dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said George. \"Very fond of dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I. There's something about dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said George. \"Of course, there's something about cats, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, isn't there?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, still, cats aren't dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I've noticed that.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. With a sinking of the heart, for the topic was one\r\non which he felt he could rather spread himself, George perceived that\r\nthe girl regarded the subject of dogs as fully threshed out. He stood\r\nfor a while licking his lips in thoughtful silence.\r\n\r\n\"So you come from the West?\" said Molly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be nice out there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prairies and all that sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You aren't a cow-boy, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I am an artist,\" said George proudly.\r\n\r\n\"An artist? Paint pictures, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a studio?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I mean, near Washington Square. In a place called the Sheridan.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Sheridan? Really? Then perhaps you know Mr. Beamish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Oh, yes. Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a dear, isn't he? I've known him all my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be jolly to be an artist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd love to see some of your pictures.\"\r\n\r\nWarm thrills permeated George's system.\r\n\r\n\"May I send you one of them?\" he bleated.\r\n\r\n\"That's awfully sweet of you.\"\r\n\r\nSo uplifted was George Finch by this wholly unexpected development\r\nthat there is no saying what heights of eloquence he might not now\r\nhave reached, had he been given another ten minutes of the girl's\r\nuninterrupted society. The fact that she was prepared to accept one of\r\nhis pictures seemed to bring them very close together. He had never yet\r\nmet anybody who would. For the first time since their interview had\r\nbegun he felt almost at his ease.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at this moment the door opened: and like a sharp attack\r\nof poison-gas Mrs. Waddington floated into the room.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing down here, Molly?\" she said.\r\n\r\nShe gave George one of those looks of hers, and his newly-born\r\nsang-froid immediately turned blue at the roots.\r\n\r\n\"I've been talking to Mr. Finch, mother. Isn't it interesting--Mr.\r\nFinch is an artist. He paints pictures.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington did not reply: for she had been struck suddenly dumb\r\nby a hideous discovery. Until this moment she had not examined George\r\nwith any real closeness. When she had looked at him before it had been\r\nmerely with the almost impersonal horror and disgust with which any\r\nhostess looks at an excrescence who at the eleventh hour horns in on\r\none of her carefully planned dinners. His face, though revolting, had\r\nhad no personal message for her.\r\n\r\nBut now it was different. Suddenly this young man's foul features had\r\nbecome fraught with a dreadful significance. Sub-consciously, Mrs.\r\nWaddington had been troubled ever since she had heard them by the\r\nwords Molly had spoken in her bedroom: and now they shot to the surface\r\nof her mind like gruesome things from the dark depths of some sinister\r\npool. \"The sort of man I think I should rather like,\" Molly had said,\r\n\"would be a sort of slimmish, smallish man with nice brown eyes and\r\nrather gold-y, chestnutty hair.\" She stared at George. Yes! He was\r\nslimmish. He was also smallish. His eyes, though far from nice, were\r\nbrown: and his hair was undeniably of a chestnut hue.\r\n\r\n\"Who sort of chokes and turns pink and twists his fingers and makes\r\nfunny noises and trips over his feet....\" Thus had the description\r\ncontinued, and precisely thus was the young man before her now\r\nbehaving. For her gaze had had the worst effect on George Finch, and\r\nseldom in his career had he choked more throatily, turned a brighter\r\npink, twisted his fingers into a more intricate pattern, made funnier\r\nnoises and tripped more heartily over his feet than he was doing now.\r\nMrs. Waddington was convinced. It had been no mere imaginary figure\r\nthat Molly had described, but a living, breathing pestilence--and this\r\nwas he.\r\n\r\nAnd he was an artist! Mrs. Waddington shuddered. Of all the myriad\r\nindividuals that went to make up the kaleidoscopic life of New York,\r\nshe disliked artists most. They never had any money. They were\r\ndissolute and feckless. They attended dances at Webster Hall in strange\r\ncostumes, and frequently played the ukulele. And this man was one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Molly, \"we'd better go upstairs?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington came out of her trance.\r\n\r\n\"You had better go upstairs,\" she said, emphasising the pronoun in a\r\nmanner that would have impressed itself upon the least sensitive of\r\nmen. George got it nicely.\r\n\r\n\"I--er--think, perhaps,\" he mumbled, \"as it is--er--getting late....\"\r\n\r\n\"You aren't going?\" said Molly concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly Mr. Finch is going,\" said Mrs. Waddington: and there was\r\nthat in her demeanour which suggested that at any moment she might\r\nplace one hand on the scruff of his neck and the other on the seat of\r\nhis trousers and heave. \"If Mr. Finch has appointments that call him\r\nelsewhere, we must not detain him. Good night, Mr. Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night. Thank you for a--er--very pleasant evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was most kay-eend of you to come,\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Do come again,\" said Molly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch,\" said Mrs. Waddington, \"is no doubt a very ba-husy man.\r\nPlease go upstairs immediately, Molly. _Good_ na'eet, Mr. Finch.\"\r\n\r\nShe continued to regard him in a manner hardly in keeping with the fine\r\nold traditions of American hospitality.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris,\" she said, as the door closed.\r\n\r\n\"Madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"On no pretext whatever, Ferris, is that person who has just left to be\r\nadmitted to the house again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam,\" said the butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nIt was a fair sunny morning next day when George Finch trotted up the\r\nsteps of Number 16, Seventy-Ninth Street, East, and pressed the bell.\r\nHe was wearing his dove-grey suit, and under his arm was an enormous\r\ncanvas wrapped in brown paper. After much thought he had decided\r\nto present Molly with his favourite work, Hail, Jocund Spring!--a\r\npicture representing a young woman, scantily draped and obviously\r\nsuffering from an advanced form of chorea, dancing with lambs in a\r\nflower-speckled field. At the moment which George had selected for her\r\nportrayal, she had--to judge from her expression--just stepped rather\r\nhard on a sharp stone. Still, she was George's master-piece, and he\r\nintended to present her to Molly.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. Ferris, the butler, appeared.\r\n\r\n\"All goods,\" said Ferris, regarding George dispassionately, \"must be\r\ndelivered in the rear.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge blinked.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see Miss Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Waddington is not at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I see Mr. Waddington?\" asked George, accepting the second-best.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Waddington is not at home.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge hesitated a moment before he spoke again. But love conquers all.\r\n\r\n\"Can I see Mrs. Waddington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Waddington is not at home.\"\r\n\r\nAs the butler spoke, there proceeded from the upper regions of the\r\nhouse a commanding female voice that inquired of an unseen Sigsbee how\r\nmany times the speaker had told him not to smoke in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\"But I can hear her,\" George pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe butler shrugged his shoulders with an aloof gesture, as if\r\ndisclaiming all desire to go into these mysteries. His look suggested\r\nthat he thought George might possibly be psychic.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Waddington is not at home,\" he said once more.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Nice morning,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"The weather appears to be clement,\" agreed Ferris.\r\n\r\nGeorge then tumbled backwards down the steps, and the interview\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\nGeorge told him all. The unfortunate young man was still looking licked\r\nto a splinter. For several hours he had been wandering distractedly\r\nthrough the streets of New York, and now he had crawled into Hamilton\r\nBeamish's apartment in the hope that a keener mind than his own might\r\nbe able to detect in the encompassing clouds a silver lining which he\r\nhimself had missed altogether.\r\n\r\n\"Let me get this clear,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"You called at the\r\nhouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the butler refused to admit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish regarded his stricken friend compassionately.\r\n\r\n\"My poor cloth-headed George,\" he said, \"you appear to have made a\r\ncomplete mess of things. By being impetuous you have ruined everything.\r\nWhy could you not have waited and let me introduce you into this house\r\nin a normal and straightforward fashion, in my capacity of an old\r\nfriend of the family? I would have started you right. As things are,\r\nyou have allowed yourself to take on the semblance of an outcast.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when old Waddington invited me to dinner--actually invited me to\r\ndinner....\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have kicked him in the eye and made good your escape,\" said\r\nHamilton Beamish firmly. \"Surely, after all that I said to you about\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington, you were under no illusion that his patronage\r\nwould make you popular in the home? Sigsbee H. Waddington is one of\r\nthose men who have only to express a liking for anybody to cause their\r\nwives to look on him as something out of the Underworld. Sigsbee H.\r\nWaddington could not bring the Prince of Wales home to dinner and get\r\naway with it. And when he drags in and lays on the mat a specimen--I\r\nuse the word in the kindliest spirit--like you, and does so, moreover,\r\nfive minutes before the start of a formal dinner-party, thus upsetting\r\nthe seating arrangements and leading to black thoughts in the kitchen,\r\ncan you blame his wife for not fawning on you? And on top of that you\r\npretend to be an artist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an artist,\" said George, with a flicker of spirit. It was a\r\nsubject on which he held strong views.\r\n\r\n\"The point is a debatable one. And, anyhow, you should have concealed\r\nit from Mrs. Waddington. A woman of her type looks on artists as blots\r\non the social scheme. I told you she judged her fellow-creatures\r\nentirely by their balance at the bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have plenty of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was she to know that? You tell her you are an artist, and she\r\nnaturally imagines you....\"\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang shrilly, interrupting Mr. Beamish's flow of thought.\r\nThere was an impatient frown on his face as he unhooked the receiver,\r\nbut a moment later this had passed away and, when he spoke, it was in\r\na kindly and indulgent tone.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Molly, my child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Molly!\" cried George.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish ignored the exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"He is a great friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?\" said George.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish continued to accord him that complete lack of\r\nattention characteristic of the efficient telephoner when addressed\r\nwhile at the instrument.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has been telling me about it. He's here now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she want me to speak to her?\" quavered George.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I'll come at once.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish replaced the receiver, and stood for awhile in thought.\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\" asked George, deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\"This is interesting,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\"\r\n\r\n\"This causes me to revise my views to some extent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I might have foreseen it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish rubbed his chin meditatively.\r\n\r\n\"The mind of a girl works oddly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was Molly Waddington,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am by no means sure,\" said Mr. Beamish regarding George owlishly\r\nthrough his spectacles, \"that, after all, everything has not happened\r\nfor the best. I omitted to take into my calculations the fact that what\r\nhas occurred would naturally give you in the eyes of a warm-hearted\r\ngirl, surrounded normally by men with incomes in six figures, a certain\r\nromantic glamour. Any girl with nice instincts must inevitably be\r\nattracted to a penniless artist whom her mother forbids her to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\"\r\n\r\n\"She asked me if you were a friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then what did she say?\"\r\n\r\n\"She told me that her stepmother had forbidden you the house and that\r\nshe had been expressly ordered never to see you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did she say after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"She asked me to come up to the house and have a talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"About me?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going?\"\r\n\r\n\"At once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hamilton,\" said George in a quivering voice, \"Hamilton, old man, pitch\r\nit strong!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, speak enthusiastically on your behalf?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean just that. How well you put these things, Hamilton!\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish took up his hat and placed it on his head.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange,\" he said meditatively, \"that I should be assisting you\r\nin this matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your good heart,\" said George. \"You have a heart of gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have fallen in love at first sight, and my views on love at first\r\nsight are well known.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're all wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"My views are never wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean wrong exactly,\" said George with sycophantic haste. \"I\r\nmean that in certain cases love at first sight is the only thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love should be a reasoned emotion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if you suddenly see a girl like Molly Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I marry,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"it will be the result of a\r\ncarefully calculated process of thought. I shall first decide after\r\ncool reflection that I have reached the age at which it is best for\r\nme to marry. I shall then run over the list of my female friends till\r\nI have selected one whose mind and tastes are in harmony with mine. I\r\nshall then....\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to change?\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Change what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your clothes. If you are going to see Her....\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall then,\" proceeded Hamilton Beamish, \"watch her carefully for a\r\nconsiderable length of time in order to assure myself that I have not\r\nallowed passion to blind me to any faults in her disposition. After\r\nthat....\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't possibly call on Miss Waddington in those trousers,\" said\r\nGeorge. \"And your shirt does not match your socks. You must....\"\r\n\r\n\"After that, provided in the interval I have not observed any more\r\nsuitable candidate for my affections, I shall go to her and in a few\r\nsimple words ask her to be my wife. I shall point out that my income\r\nis sufficient for two, that my morals are above reproach, that....\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you a really nice suit that's been properly pressed and\r\nbrushed and a rather newer pair of shoes and a less floppy sort of hat\r\nand....\"\r\n\r\n\"... that my disposition is amiable and my habits regular. And she and\r\nI will settle down to the Marriage Sane.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about your cuffs?\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"What about my cuffs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you really going to see Miss Waddington in frayed cuffs?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge had nothing more to say. It was sacrilege, but there seemed no\r\nway of preventing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nAs Hamilton Beamish, some quarter of an hour later, climbed in a series\r\nof efficient movements up the stairs of the green omnibus which was\r\nwaiting in Washington Square, the summer afternoon had reached its best\r\nand sweetest. A red-blooded, one hundred per cent American sun still\r\nshone warmly down from a sky of gleaming azure, but there had stolen\r\ninto the air a hint of the cool of evening. It was the sort of day\r\nwhen Tin Pan Alley lyric-writers suddenly realise that \"love\" rhymes\r\nwith \"skies above,\" and rush off, snorting, to turn out the song-hit\r\nof a lifetime. Sentimentality was abroad: and gradually, without his\r\nbeing aware of it, its seeds began to plant themselves in the stony and\r\nuncompromising soil of Hamilton Beamish's bosom.\r\n\r\nYes, little by little, as the omnibus rolled on up the Avenue, there\r\nbegan to burgeon in Hamilton Beamish a mood of gentle tolerance for his\r\nspecies. He no longer blamed so whole-heartedly the disposition of his\r\nfellow-men to entertain towards the opposite sex on short acquaintance\r\na warmth of emotion which could be scientifically justified only by a\r\nlong and intimate knowledge of character. For the first time he began\r\nto debate within himself whether there was not something to be said for\r\na man who was, like George Finch, plunged headlong into love with a\r\ngirl to whom he had never even spoken.\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this precise moment--just, dramatically enough, when the\r\nbus was passing Twenty-Ninth Street with its pretty and suggestive\r\nglimpse of the Little Church Round the Corner--that he noticed for the\r\nfirst time the girl in the seat across the way.\r\n\r\nShe was a girl of _chic_ and _élan_. One may go still\r\nfurther--a girl of _espièglerie_ and _je ne sais quoi_. She\r\nwas dressed, as Hamilton Beamish's experienced eye noted in one swift\r\nglance, in a delightful two-piece suit composed of a smart coat in\r\nfine quality repp, lined throughout with crêpe-de-chine, over a dainty\r\nlong-sleeved frock of figured Marocain prettily pleated at the sides\r\nand finished at the neck with a small collar and kilted frill: a dress\r\nwhich, as every schoolboy knows, can be had in beige, grey, mid-grey,\r\nopal, snuff, powder, burnt wood, puce, brown, bottle, almond, navy,\r\nblack and dark Saxe. Her colour was dark Saxe.\r\n\r\nAnother glance enabled Hamilton Beamish to take in her hat. It was, he\r\nperceived, a becoming hat in Yedda Visca straw, trimmed and bound with\r\nsilk petersham ribbon, individual without being conspicuous, artistic\r\nin line and exquisite in style: and from beneath it there strayed a\r\nsingle curl of about the colour of a good Pekingese dog. Judging the\r\nrest of her hair by the light of this curl, Hamilton Beamish deduced\r\nthat, when combing and dressing it, she just moistened the brush with\r\na little scalpoline, thus producing a gleamy mass, sparkling with life\r\nand possessing that incomparable softness, freshness and luxuriance, at\r\nthe same time toning each single hair to grow thick, long and strong.\r\nNo doubt she had read advertisements of the tonic in the papers and\r\nnow, having bought a bottle, was seeing how healthy and youthful her\r\nhair appeared after this delightful, refreshing dressing.\r\n\r\nHer shoes were of black patent-leather, her stockings of steel-grey.\r\nShe had that schoolgirl complexion and the skin you love to touch.\r\n\r\nAll these things the trained eye of Hamilton Beamish noted, swivelling\r\nrapidly sideways and swivelling rapidly back again. But it was her face\r\nthat he noted most particularly. It was just the sort of face which, if\r\nhe had not had his policy of Sane Love all carefully mapped out, would\r\nhave exercised the most disturbing effect on his emotions. Even as it\r\nwas, this strong, competent man could not check, as he alighted from\r\nthe bus at Seventy-Ninth Street, a twinge of that wistful melancholy\r\nwhich men feel when they are letting a good thing get away from them.\r\n\r\nSad, reflected Hamilton Beamish, as he stood upon the steps of Number\r\n16 and prepared to ring the bell, that he would never see this girl\r\nagain. Naturally, a man of his stamp was not in love at first sight,\r\nbut nevertheless he did not conceal it from himself that nothing would\r\nsuit him better than to make her acquaintance and, after careful study\r\nof her character and disposition, possibly discover in a year or two\r\nthat it was she whom Nature had intended for his mate.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point in his reflections that he perceived her standing\r\nat his elbow.\r\n\r\nThere are moments when even the coolest-headed efficiency expert finds\r\nit hard to maintain his poise. Hamilton Beamish was definitely taken\r\naback: and, had he been a lesser man, one would have said that he\r\nbecame for an instant definitely pop-eyed. Apart from the fact that\r\nhe had been thinking of her and thinking of her tenderly, there was\r\nthe embarrassment of standing side by side with a strange girl on a\r\ndoor-step. In such a crisis it is very difficult for a man to know\r\nprecisely how to behave. Should he endeavour to create the illusion\r\nthat he is not aware of her presence? Or should he make some chatty\r\nremark? And, if a chatty remark, what chatty remark?\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish was still grappling with this problem, when the girl\r\nsolved it for him. Suddenly screwing up a face which looked even more\r\nattractive at point-blank range than it had appeared in profile, she\r\nuttered the exclamation \"Oo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oo!\" said this girl.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, all Hamilton Beamish felt was that almost ecstatic\r\nrelief which comes over the man of sensibility when he finds that a\r\npretty girl has an attractive voice. Too many times in his career he\r\nhad admired girls from afar, only to discover, when they spoke, that\r\nthey had voices like peacocks calling up the rain. The next instant,\r\nhowever, he had recognised that his companion was suffering, and his\r\nheart was filled with a blend of compassion and zeal. Her pain aroused\r\nsimultaneously the pity of the man and the efficiency of the efficiency\r\nexpert.\r\n\r\n\"You have something in your eye?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"A bit of dust or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult tasks that can confront the ordinary man is\r\nthe extraction of foreign bodies from the eye of a perfect stranger of\r\nthe opposite sex. But Hamilton Beamish was not an ordinary man. Barely\r\nten seconds later, he was replacing his handkerchief in his pocket and\r\nthe girl was blinking at him gratefully.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you ever so much,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"A doctor couldn't have done it more neatly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just a knack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is it,\" asked the girl, \"that, when you get a speck of dust in\r\nyour eye the size of a pin-point, it seems as big as all out-doors?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish could answer that. The subject was one he had studied.\r\n\r\n\"The conjunctiva, a layer of mucous membrane which lines the back of\r\nthe eyelids and is reflected on the front of the globe, this reflection\r\nforming the fornix, is extremely sensitive. This is especially so at\r\nthe point where the tarsal plates of fibrous tissue are attached to the\r\norbital margin by the superior and inferior palpebral ligaments.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Are you calling on Mrs. Waddington?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"On Miss Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never met her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know the whole family, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Only Mrs. Waddington. Would you mind ringing the bell?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish pressed the button.\r\n\r\n\"I saw you on the omnibus,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was sitting in the next seat.\"\r\n\r\n\"How odd!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a lovely day, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like the summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"When it's not too hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Though, as a matter of fact,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"I always say\r\nthat what one objects to is not the heat but the humidity.\"\r\n\r\nWhich simply goes to prove that even efficiency experts, when they\r\nfall in love at first sight, can babble like any man of inferior\r\nintellect in the same circumstances. Strange and violent emotions were\r\nracking Hamilton Beamish's bosom: and, casting away the principles of\r\na lifetime, he recognised without a trace of shame that love had come\r\nto him at last--not creeping scientifically into his soul, as he had\r\nsupposed it would, but elbowing its way in with the Berserk rush of\r\na commuter charging into the five-fifteen. Yes, he was in love. And\r\nit is proof of the completeness with which passion had blunted his\r\nintellectual faculties that he was under the impression that in the\r\nrecent exchange of remarks he had been talking rather well.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. Ferris appeared. He looked at the girl, not with the\r\ncold distaste which he had exhibited earlier in the day towards George\r\nFinch, but with a certain paternal affection. Ferris measured forty-six\r\nround the waist, but Beauty still had its appeal for him.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Waddington desired me to say, miss,\" he said, \"that an\r\nappointment of an urgent nature has called her elsewhere, rendering it\r\nimpossible for her to see you this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"She might have phoned me,\" the girl complained.\r\n\r\nFerris allowed one eyebrow to flicker momentarily, conveying the idea,\r\nthat, while he sympathised, a spirit of loyalty forbade him to join in\r\ncriticism of his employer.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Waddington wished to know if it would be convenient to you, miss,\r\nif she called upon you to-morrow at five o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, miss. Miss Waddington is expecting you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish continued to stare after the girl, who, with a\r\nfriendly nod in his direction, had begun to walk light-heartedly out of\r\nhis life along the street.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that young lady, Ferris?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I could not say, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why couldn't you? You seemed to know her just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. I had never seen the young lady before. Mrs. Waddington,\r\nhowever, had mentioned that she would be calling at this hour and\r\ninstructed me to give the message which I delivered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't Mrs. Waddington say who was calling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. The young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ass!\" said Hamilton Beamish. But even he was not strong man enough to\r\nsay it aloud. \"I mean, didn't she tell you the young lady's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. If you will step this way, sir, I will conduct you to Miss\r\nWaddington, who is in the library.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems funny that Mrs. Waddington did not tell you the young lady's\r\nname,\" brooded Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"Very humorous, sir,\" agreed the butler indulgently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jimmy, it was sweet of you to come,\" said Molly.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish patted her hand absently. He was too preoccupied to\r\nnotice the hateful name by which she had addressed him.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a wonderful experience,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"So have I. I think I'm in love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given the matter as close attention as has been possible, in\r\nthe limited time at my disposal,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"and I have\r\nreached the conclusion that I, too, am in love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I am in love with your friend, George Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in love with ...\" Hamilton Beamish paused. \"I don't know her\r\nname. She is a most charming girl. I met her coming up here on the bus,\r\nand we talked for awhile on the front door-steps. I took something out\r\nof her eye.\"\r\n\r\nMolly stared incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"You have fallen in love with a girl and you don't know who she is?\r\nBut I thought you always said that love was a reasoned emotion and all\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"One's views alter,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"A man's intellectual\r\nperceptions do not stand still. One develops.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was never so surprised in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"It came as a complete surprise to me,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"It is\r\nexcessively aggravating that I do not know her name nor where she lives\r\nnor anything about her except that she appears to be a friend--or at\r\nleast an acquaintance--of your stepmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she knows mother, does she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently. She was calling here by appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"All sorts of weird people call on mother. She is honorary secretary to\r\nabout a hundred societies.\"\r\n\r\n\"This girl was of medium height, with an extremely graceful figure\r\nand bright brown hair. She wore a two-piece suit with a coat of fine\r\nquality repp over a long-sleeved frock of figured Marocain pleated\r\nat the sides and finished at the neck with a small collar and kilted\r\nfrill. Her hat was of Yedda Visca straw, trimmed and bound with silk\r\npetersham ribbon. She had patent-leather shoes, silk stockings, and\r\neyes of tender grey like the mists of sunrise floating over some magic\r\npool of Fairyland. Does the description suggest anybody to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think so--She sounds nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is nice. I gazed into those eyes only for a moment, but I shall\r\nnever forget them. They were deeper than the depth of waters stilled at\r\neven.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could ask mother who she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be greatly obliged if you would do so,\" said Hamilton\r\nBeamish. \"Mention that it is some one upon whom she is to call at five\r\no'clock to-morrow, and telephone me the name and address. Oh, to seize\r\nher and hold her close to me and kiss her again and again and again!\r\nAnd now, child, tell me of yourself. I think you mentioned that you\r\nalso were in love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. With George Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"A capital fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a lambkin,\" emended Molly warmly.\r\n\r\n\"A lambkin, if you prefer it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I asked you to come here to-day to tell me what I ought to do. You\r\nsee, mother doesn't like him.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I gathered.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has forbidden him the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it's because he has no money.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish was on the point of mentioning that George had an\r\nalmost indecent amount of money, but he checked himself. Who was he\r\nthat he should destroy a young girl's dreams? It was as a romantic and\r\npenniless artist that George Finch had won this girl's heart. It would\r\nbe cruel to reveal the fact that he was rich and the worst artist in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n\"Your stepmother,\" he agreed, \"is apt to see eye to eye with Bradstreet\r\nin her estimation of her fellows.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care if he hasn't any money,\" said Molly. \"You know that, when\r\nI marry, I get that pearl necklace that father bought for mother. It's\r\nbeing held in trust for me. I can sell it and get thousands of dollars,\r\nso that we shall be as right as anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, of course, I don't want to make a runaway marriage if I can help\r\nit. I want to be married with bridesmaids and cake and presents and\r\nphotographs in the rotogravure section and everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally.\"\r\n\r\n\"So the point is, mother must learn to love George. Now listen, Jimmy\r\ndear. Mother will be going to see her palmist, very soon--she's always\r\ngoing to palmists, you know.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish nodded. He had not been aware of this trait in Mrs.\r\nWaddington's character, but he could believe anything of her. Now that\r\nhe came to consider the matter, he recognised that Mrs. Waddington was\r\nprecisely the sort of woman who, in the intervals of sitting in the\r\nsalons of beauty specialists with green mud on her face, would go to\r\npalmists.\r\n\r\n\"And what you must do is to go to this palmist before mother gets\r\nthere and bribe her to say that my only happiness is bound up with a\r\nbrown-haired artist whose name begins with a G.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely think that even a palmist would make Mrs. Waddington\r\nbelieve that.\"\r\n\r\n\"She believes everything Madame Eulalie sees in the crystal.\"\r\n\r\n\"But hardly that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, perhaps you're right. Well, then, you must get Madame Eulalie at\r\nleast to steer mother off Lord Hunstanton. Last night, she told me in\r\nso many words that she wanted me to marry him. He's always here, and\r\nit's awful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could do that, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a darling. I should think she would do it for ten dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty at the outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that's settled. I knew I could rely on you. By the way, will you\r\ntell George something quite casually?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just mention to him that, if he happens to be strolling in Central\r\nPark to-morrow afternoon near the Zoo, we might run into each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Molly, \"tell me all about George and how you came to\r\nknow one another and what you thought of him when you first saw him and\r\nwhat he likes for breakfast and what he talks about and what he said\r\nabout me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected that the passage of time, giving\r\nopportunity for quiet reflection on the subject of the illogical nature\r\nof the infatuation in which he had allowed himself to become involved,\r\nwould have brought remorse to so clear and ruthless a thinker as\r\nHamilton Beamish. It was not so, but far otherwise. As Hamilton Beamish\r\nsat in the ante-chamber of Madame Eulalie's office next day, he gloried\r\nin his folly: and when his better self endeavoured to point out to him\r\nthat what had happened was that he had allowed himself to be ensnared\r\nby a girl's face--that is to say, by a purely fortuitous arrangement of\r\ncertain albuminoids and fatty molecules, all Hamilton Beamish did was\r\nto tell his better self to put its head in a bag. He was in love, and\r\nhe liked it. He was in love, and proud of it. His only really coherent\r\nthought as he waited in the ante-room was a resolve to withdraw the\r\nbooklet on \"The Marriage Sane\" from circulation and try his hand at\r\nwriting a poem or two.\r\n\r\n\"Madame Eulalie will see you now, sir,\" announced the maid, breaking in\r\nupon his reverie.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish entered the inner room. And, having entered it,\r\nstopped dead.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe girl gave that fleeting pat at her hair which is always Woman's\r\nreaction to the unexpected situation. And Hamilton Beamish looking\r\nat that hair emotionally, perceived that he had been right in his\r\nyesterday's surmise. It was, as he had suspected, a gleamy mass,\r\nsparkling with life and possessing that incomparable softness,\r\nfreshness and luxuriance.\r\n\r\n\"Why, how do you do?\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I'm fine,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"We seem fated to meet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm not quarrelling with fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"Fancy it being you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy who being me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy you being you.\" It occurred to him that he was not making\r\nhimself quite clear. \"I mean, I was sent here with a message for Madame\r\nEulalie, and she turns out to be you.\"\r\n\r\n\"A message? Who from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From whom?\" corrected Hamilton Beamish. Even in the grip of love, a\r\nspecialist on Pure English remains a specialist on Pure English.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I said--Who from?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish smiled an indulgent smile. These little mistakes could\r\nbe corrected later--possibly on the honeymoon.\r\n\r\n\"From Molly Waddington. She asked me to....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then you don't want me to read your hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing I want more in this world,\" said Hamilton Beamish\r\nwarmly, \"than to have you read my hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to read it to tell your character, of course,\" said the\r\ngirl. \"I can see that at a glance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly. You have a strong, dominating nature and a keen\r\nincisive mind. You have great breadth of vision, iron determination,\r\nand marvellous insight. Yet with it all you are at heart gentle, kind\r\nand lovable; deeply altruistic and generous to a fault. You have it in\r\nyou to be a leader of men. You remind me of Julius Cæsar, Shakespeare\r\nand Napoleon Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me more,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"If you ever fell in love....\"\r\n\r\n\"If I ever fell in love....\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ever fell in love,\" said the girl, raising her eyes to his and\r\ndrawing a step closer, \"you would....\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Delancy Cabot,\" announced the maid.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, darn it!\" said Madame Eulalie. \"I forgot I had an appointment.\r\nSend him in.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I wait?\" breathed Hamilton Beamish devoutly.\r\n\r\n\"Please do. I shan't be long.\" She turned to the door. \"Come in, Mr.\r\nCabot.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish wheeled around. A long, stringy person was walking\r\ndaintily into the room. He was richly, even superbly, dressed in the\r\nconventional costume of the popular clubman and pet of Society. He\r\nwore lavender gloves and a carnation in his buttonhole, and a vast\r\nexpanse of snowy collar encircled a neck which suggested that he might\r\nbe a throw-back to some giraffe ancestor. A pleasing feature of this\r\nneck was an Adam's apple that could have belonged to only one man of\r\nHamilton Beamish's acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"Garroway!\" cried Hamilton Beamish. \"What are you doing here? And what\r\nthe devil does this masquerade mean?\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman seemed taken aback. His face became as red as his wrists.\r\nBut for the collar, which held him in a grip of iron, his jaw would no\r\ndoubt have fallen.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't expect to find you here, Mr. Beamish,\" he said\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't expect to find you here, calling yourself De Courcy\r\nBellville.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delancy Cabot, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delancy Cabot, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like the name,\" urged the policeman. \"I saw it in a book.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was breathing hard.\r\n\r\n\"Is this man a policeman?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"His name is Garroway, and I am\r\nteaching him to write poetry. And what I want to know,\" he thundered,\r\nturning on the unhappy man, whose Adam's apple was now leaping like a\r\nyoung lamb in the springtime, \"is what are you doing here, interrupting\r\na--interrupting a--in short interrupting, when you ought either to be\r\nabout your constabulary duties or else sitting quietly at home studying\r\nJohn Drinkwater. That,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"is what I want to know.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway coughed.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, Mr. Beamish, I did not know that Madame Eulalie was a\r\nfriend of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind whose friend she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it makes all the difference, Mr. Beamish. I can now go back to\r\nheadquarters and report that Madame Eulalie is above suspicion. You\r\nsee, sir, I was sent here by my superior officers to effect a cop.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, effect a cop?\"\r\n\r\n\"To make an arrest, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do not say 'effect a cop.' Purge yourself of these vulgarisms,\r\nGarroway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I will indeed, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aim at the English Pure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Most certainly, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what on earth do you mean by saying that you were sent here to\r\narrest this lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been called to the attention of my superior officers, Mr.\r\nBeamish, that Madame Eulalie is in the habit of telling fortunes for a\r\nmonetary consideration. Against the law, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish snorted.\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous! If that's the law, alter it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my best, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had the privilege of watching Madame Eulalie engaged upon her\r\nart, and she reveals nothing but the most limpid truth. So go back to\r\nyour superior officers and tell them to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I will, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now leave us. We would be alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Beamish,\" said Officer Garroway humbly. \"At once, Mr.\r\nBeamish.\"\r\n\r\nFor some moments after the door had closed, the girl stood staring at\r\nHamilton Beamish with wondering eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Was that man really a policeman?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you handled him like that, and he said, 'Yes, sir!' and 'No, sir!'\r\nand crawled out on all fours.\" She drew a deep breath. \"It seems to me\r\nthat you are just the sort of friend a lonely girl needs in this great\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only too delighted that I was able to be of service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Service is right! Mr. Beamish....\"\r\n\r\n\"My first name is Hamilton.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"You are not _the_ Hamilton Beamish? Not the man who wrote the\r\nbooklets?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have written a few booklets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you're my favourite author! If it hadn't been for you I would\r\nstill be mouldering in a little one-horse town where there wasn't\r\neven a good soda-fountain. But I got hold of a couple of your Are You\r\nin a Groove? things, and I packed up my grip and came right along to\r\nNew York to lead a larger life. If I'd known yesterday that you were\r\nHamilton Beamish, I'd have kissed you on the door-step!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Hamilton Beamish's intention to point out that a curtained\r\nroom with a closed door was an even more suitable place for such a\r\ndemonstration, but, even as he tried to speak, there gripped him for\r\nthe first time in his life a strange, almost George Finch-like shyness.\r\nOne deprecates the modern practice of exposing the great, but candour\r\ncompels one to speak out and say that at this juncture Hamilton Beamish\r\nemitted a simpering giggle and began to twiddle his fingers.\r\n\r\nThe strange weakness passed, and he was himself again. He adjusted his\r\nglasses firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Would you,\" he asked, \"could you possibly.... Do you think you could\r\nmanage to come and lunch somewhere to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl uttered an exclamation of annoyance.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that too bad!\" she said. \"I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"The day after?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry. I'm afraid I shall be off the map for three weeks. I've got\r\nto jump on a train to-morrow and go visit the old folks back in East\r\nGilead. It's Pop's birthday on Saturday, and I never miss it.\"\r\n\r\n\"East Gilead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Idaho. You wouldn't have heard of the place, but it's there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have heard of it. A great friend of mine comes from East Gilead.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say! Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"A man named George Finch.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed amusedly.\r\n\r\n\"You don't actually mean to tell me you know George Finch?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is my most intimate friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I trust for your sake,\" said the girl, \"that he is not such a yap\r\nas he used to be.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish reflected. Was George Finch a yap? How precisely did\r\none estimate the yaphood of one's friends?\r\n\r\n\"By the word 'yap' you mean....\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean a yap. The sort of fellow who couldn't say Bo to a goose.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish had never seen George Finch in conversation with a\r\ngoose, but he thought he was a good enough judge of character to be\r\nable to credit him with the ability to perform the very trivial deed of\r\ndaring indicated.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy New York has changed George,\" he replied, after reflection.\r\n\"In fact, now that I remember, it was on more or less that very subject\r\nthat I called to see you in a professional capacity. The fact is,\r\nGeorge Finch has fallen violently in love with Molly Waddington, the\r\nstepdaughter of your client, Mrs. Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say! And I suppose he's too shy to come within a mile of\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary. The night before last he seems to have forced his way\r\ninto the house--you might say, practically forced his way--and now Mrs.\r\nWaddington has forbidden him to see Molly again, fearing that he will\r\nspoil her plan of marrying the poor child to a certain Lord Hunstanton.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl stared.\r\n\r\n\"You're right! George must have altered.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we were wondering--Molly and I--if we could possibly induce you to\r\nstoop to a--shall I say a benevolent little ruse. Mrs. Waddington is\r\ncoming to see you to-day at five, and it was Molly's suggestion that I\r\nshould sound you as to whether you would consent to take a look in the\r\ncrystal and tell Mrs. Waddington that you see danger threatening Molly\r\nfrom a dark man with an eye-glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't much to do in return for all you have done for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"I knew, the moment I\r\nset eyes on you, that you were a woman in a million. I wonder,--could\r\nyou possibly come to lunch one day after you return?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd love it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll leave you my telephone number.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. Give George my regards. I'd like to see him when I get back.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hamilton.\"\r\n\r\nHer face wore a doubtful look.\r\n\r\n\"I don't much like that name Hamilton. It's kind of stiff.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish had a brief struggle with himself.\r\n\r\n\"My name is also James. At one time in my life many people used to\r\ncall me Jimmy.\" He shuddered a little, but repeated the word bravely:\r\n\"Jimmy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put me on the list,\" said the girl. \"I like that much better.\r\nGood-bye, Jimmy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\nSo ended the first spasm of a great man's love-story. A few moments\r\nlater, Hamilton Beamish was walking in a sort of dance-measure down the\r\nstreet. Near Washington Square he gave a small boy a dollar and asked\r\nhim if he was going to be President some day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\n\"George,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"I met some one to-day who knew you\r\nback in East Gilead. A girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was her name? Did Molly give you any message for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame Eulalie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember anyone called that. Did Molly give you any message\r\nfor me?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is slim and graceful and has tender grey eyes like mists floating\r\nover some pool in Fairyland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly don't remember anyone in East Gilead like that. Did Molly\r\ngive you any message for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't?\" George flung himself despairingly into a chair. \"This is\r\nthe end!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, she did,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"I was forgetting. She told\r\nme to tell you that, if you happened to be in Central Park to-morrow\r\nafternoon near the Zoo, you might meet her.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the maddest, merriest day of all the glad New Year,\" said\r\nGeorge Finch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nMadame Eulalie peered into the crystal that was cupped between her\r\nshapely hands. The face that had caused Hamilton Beamish to jettison\r\nthe principles of a lifetime was concentrated and serious.\r\n\r\n\"The mists begin to clear away!\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Waddington. She had been hoping they would.\r\n\r\n\"There is some one very near to you....\"\r\n\r\n\"A spirit?\" said Mrs. Waddington nervously, casting an apprehensive\r\nglance over her shoulder. She was never quite sure that something of\r\nthe sort might not pop out at any moment from a corner of this dim-lit,\r\nincense-scented room.\r\n\r\n\"You misunderstand me,\" said Madame Eulalie gravely. \"I mean that that\r\nwhich is taking shape in the crystal concerns some one very near to\r\nyou, some near relative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not my husband?\" said Mrs. Waddington in a flat voice. A woman,\r\ncareful with her money, she did not relish the idea of handing over ten\r\ndollars for visions about Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\n\"Does your husband's name begin with an M.?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Waddington, relieved.\r\n\r\n\"The letter M. seems to be forming itself among the mists.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a stepdaughter, Molly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she tall and dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Small and fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is she!\" said Madame Eulalie. \"I see her in a wedding-dress,\r\nwalking up an aisle. Her hand is on the arm of a dark man with an\r\neye-glass. Do you know such a person?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Hunstanton!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do seem to sense the letter H.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Hunstanton is a great friend of mine, and devoted to Molly. Do\r\nyou really see her marrying him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see her walking up the aisle.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! For she never reaches the altar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Mrs. Waddington, justly annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"From the crowd a woman springs forth. She bars the way. She seems to\r\nbe speaking rapidly, with great emotion. And the man with the eye-glass\r\nis shrinking back, his face working horribly. His expression is very\r\nvillainous. He raises a hand. He strikes the woman. She reels back. She\r\ndraws out a revolver. And then....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" cried Mrs. Waddington. \"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The vision fades,\" said Madame Eulalie, rising briskly with the air of\r\none who has given a good ten dollars' worth.\r\n\r\n\"But it can't be! It's incredible.\"\r\n\r\n\"The crystal never deceives.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Lord Hunstanton is a most delightful man.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt the woman with the revolver found him so--to her cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you may have been mistaken. Many men are dark and wear an\r\neye-glass. What did this man look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"What does Lord Hunstanton look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is tall and beautifully proportioned, with clear blue eyes and a\r\nsmall moustache which he twists between the finger and thumb of his\r\nright hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was he!\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, obviously it would be criminal to allow Miss Waddington to\r\nassociate with this man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's coming to dinner to-night.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Eulalie, whose impulses sometimes ran away with her, was about\r\nto say: \"Poison his soup\": but contrived in time to substitute for this\r\nremark a sober shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I must leave it to you, Mrs. Waddington,\" she said, \"to decide on the\r\nbest course of action. I cannot advise. I only warn. If you want change\r\nfor a large bill, I think I can manage it for you,\" she added, striking\r\nthe business note.\r\n\r\nAll the way home to Seventy-Ninth Street Mrs. Waddington pondered\r\ndeeply. And, as she was not a woman who, as a rule, exercised her\r\nbrain to any great extent, by the time she reached the house she was\r\nexperiencing some of the sensations of one who has been hit on the head\r\nby a sand-bag. What she felt that she needed above all things in the\r\nworld was complete solitude: and it was consequently with a jaundiced\r\neye that she looked upon her husband, Sigsbee Horatio, when, a few\r\nmoments after her return, he shuffled into the room where she had\r\nplanted herself down for further intensive meditation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sigsbee?\" said Mrs. Waddington, wearily.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there you are,\" said Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes and no,\" said Sigsbee.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington was exasperated to perceive at this point that her\r\ngrave matrimonial blunder was slithering about the parquet floor in the\r\nmanner of one trying out new dance-steps.\r\n\r\n\"Stand still!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" said Sigsbee H. \"I'm too nervous.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington pressed a hand to her throbbing brow.\r\n\r\n\"Then sit down!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" said Sigsbee doubtfully. He tested a chair, and sprang up\r\ninstantly as if the seat had been charged with electricity. \"I can't,\"\r\nhe said. \"I'm all of a twitter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the world do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got something to tell you and I don't know how to begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to tell you at all,\" said Sigsbee frankly. \"But I\r\npromised Molly I would. She came in a moment ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in the library. She found me there and told me this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do kindly get to the point, Sigsbee!\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised her I would break it gently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Break what gently? You are driving me mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember,\" asked Sigsbee, \"a splendid young Westerner named\r\nPinch who dropped in to dinner the night before last? A fine,\r\nbreezy....\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not likely to forget the person you mention. I have given strict\r\ninstructions that he is never again to be admitted to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, this splendid young Pinch....\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not interested in Mr. Finch,--which is, I believe, his correct\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pinch, I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finch! And what does his name matter, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Sigsbee, \"it matters this much, that Molly seems to want\r\nto make it hers. What I'm driving at, if you see what I mean, is that\r\nMolly came in a moment ago and told me that she and this young fellow\r\nFinch have just gone and got engaged to be married!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nHaving uttered these words, Sigsbee Horatio stood gazing at his wife\r\nwith something of the spell-bound horror of a man who has bored a hole\r\nin a dam and sees the water trickling through and knows that it is too\r\nlate to stop it. He had had a sort of idea all along that the news\r\nmight affect her rather powerfully, and his guess was coming true.\r\nNothing could make a woman of Mrs. Waddington's physique \"leap from her\r\nchair\": but she had begun to rise slowly like a balloon half-filled\r\nwith gas: and her face had become so contorted and her eyes so bulging\r\nthat any competent medical man of sporting tastes would have laid seven\r\nto four on a fit of apoplexy in the next few minutes.\r\n\r\nBut by some miracle this disaster--if you could call it that--did not\r\noccur. For quite a considerable time the sufferer had trouble with\r\nher vocal chords and could emit nothing but guttural croaks. Then,\r\nmastering herself with a strong effort, she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard,\" said Sigsbee H. sullenly, twisting his fingers and wishing\r\nthat he was out in Utah, rustling cattle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington moistened her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Did you. I understand you to say that Molly was engaged to be married\r\nto that Finch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did. And,\" added Sigsbee H., giving battle in the first line\r\nof trenches, \"it's no good saying it was all my fault, because I had\r\nnothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was you who brought this man into the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes.\" Sigsbee had overlooked that weak spot in his defences.\r\n\"Well, yes.\"\r\n\r\nThere came upon Mrs. Waddington a ghastly calm like that which comes\r\nupon the surface of molten lava in the crater of a volcano just before\r\nthe stuff shoots out and starts doing the local villagers a bit of no\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"Ring the bell,\" she said.\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris,\" said Mrs. Waddington, \"ask Miss Molly to come here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam.\"\r\n\r\nIn the interval which elapsed between the departure of the butler and\r\nthe arrival of the erring daughter, no conversation brilliant enough to\r\nbe worth reporting took place in the room. Once Sigsbee said \"Er----\"\r\nand in reply Mrs. Waddington said \"Be quiet!\" but that completed the\r\ndialogue. When Molly entered, Mrs. Waddington was looking straight in\r\nfront of her and heaving gently, and Sigsbee H. had just succeeded in\r\nbreaking a valuable china figure which he had taken from an occasional\r\ntable and was trying in a preoccupied manner to balance on the end of a\r\npaper-knife.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris says you want to see me, mother,\" said Molly, floating brightly\r\nin.\r\n\r\nShe stood there, looking at the two with shining eyes. Her cheeks were\r\ndelightfully flushed: and there was about her so radiant an air of\r\nsweet, innocent, girlish gaiety that it was all Mrs. Waddington could\r\ndo to refrain from hurling a bust of Edgar Allan Poe at her head.\r\n\r\n\"I do want to see you,\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"Pray tell me instantly\r\nwhat is all this nonsense I hear about you and....\" She choked. \"...\r\nand Mr. Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"To settle a bet,\" said Sigsbee H., \"is his name Finch or Pinch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Finch, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm bad at names,\" said Sigsbee. \"I was in college with a fellow\r\ncalled Follansbee and do you think I could get it out of my nut that\r\nthat guy's name was Ferguson? Not in a million years! I....\"\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet.\" Mrs. Waddington concentrated her attention on Molly once\r\nmore. \"Your father says that you told him some absurd story about\r\nbeing....\"\r\n\r\n\"Engaged to George?\" said Molly. \"Yes, it's quite true. I am. By a most\r\nextraordinary chance we met this afternoon in Central Park near the\r\nZoo....\"\r\n\r\n\"A place,\" said Sigsbee H., \"I've meant to go to a hundred times and\r\nnever seen yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right! I was only saying....\"\r\n\r\n\"We were both tremendously surprised, of course,\" said Molly. \"I said\r\n'Fancy meeting you here!' and he said....\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no wish to hear what Mr. Finch said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway, we walked round for awhile, looking at the animals, and\r\nsuddenly he asked me to marry him outside the cage of the Siberian yak.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir!\" exclaimed Sigsbee H. with a sudden strange firmness, the\r\nindulgent father who for once in his life asserts himself. \"When you\r\nget married, you'll be married in St. Thomas's like any other nice\r\ngirl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean it was outside the cage of the Siberian yak that he asked me to\r\nmarry him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ah!\" said Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\nA dreamy look had crept into Molly's eyes. Her lips were curved in\r\na tender smile, as if she were reliving that wonderful moment in a\r\ngirl's life, when the man she loves beckons to her to follow him into\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have seen his ears!\" she said. \"They were absolutely\r\ncrimson.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say!\" chuckled Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\n\"Scarlet! And, when he tried to speak, he gargled.\"\r\n\r\n\"The poor simp!\"\r\n\r\nMolly turned on her father with flaming eyes.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you call my dear darling Georgie a simp?\"\r\n\r\n\"How dare you call that simp your dear darling Georgie?\" demanded Mrs.\r\nWaddington.\r\n\r\n\"Because he is my dear darling Georgie. I love him with all my heart,\r\nthe precious lamb, and I'm going to marry him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going to do nothing of the kind!\" Mrs. Waddington quivered\r\nwith outraged indignation. \"Do you imagine I intend to allow you to\r\nruin your life by marrying a despicable fortune-hunter?\"\r\n\r\n\"He isn't a despicable fortune-hunter.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a penniless artist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure he is frightfully clever and will be able to sell his\r\npictures for ever so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tchah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said Molly defiantly, \"when I marry I get that pearl\r\nnecklace which father gave mother. I can sell that, and it will keep us\r\ngoing for years.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington was about to reply--and there is little reason to doubt\r\nthat that reply would have been about as red-hot a come-back as any\r\nhundred and eighty pound woman had ever spoken--when she was checked\r\nby a sudden exclamation of agony that proceeded from the lips of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is the matter, Sigsbee?\" she said, annoyed.\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. seemed to be wrestling with acute mental agitation. He was\r\nstaring at his daughter with protruding eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Did you say you were going to sell that necklace?\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, be quiet, Sigsbee!\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"What does it matter\r\nwhether she sells the necklace or not? It has nothing to do with the\r\nargument. The point is that this misguided girl is proposing to throw\r\nherself away on a miserable, paint-daubing, ukulele-playing artist....\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't play the ukulele. He told me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"... when she might, if she chose, marry a delightful man with a fine\r\nold English title who would....\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington broke off. There had come back to her the memory of\r\nthat scene in Madame Eulalie's office.\r\n\r\nMolly seized the opportunity afforded by her unexpected silence to make\r\na counter-attack.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't marry Lord Hunstanton if he were the last man in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honey,\" said Sigsbee H. in a low, pleading voice, \"I don't think I'd\r\nsell that necklace if I were you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I shall sell it. We shall need the money when we are\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not going to be married,\" said Mrs. Waddington, recovering.\r\n\"I should have thought any right-minded girl would have despised this\r\nwretched Finch. Why, the man appears to be so poor-spirited that he\r\ndidn't even dare to come here and tell me this awful news. He left it\r\nto you....\"\r\n\r\n\"George was not able to come here. The poor pet has been arrested by a\r\npoliceman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" cried Mrs. Waddington triumphantly. \"And that is the sort of man\r\nyou propose to marry! A gaol-bird!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think it shows what a sweet nature he has. He was so happy\r\nat being engaged that he suddenly stopped at Fifty-Ninth Street and\r\nFifth Avenue and started giving away dollar-bills to everybody who came\r\nby. In about two minutes there was a crowd stretching right across to\r\nMadison Avenue, and the traffic was blocked for miles, and they called\r\nout the police-reserves, and George was taken away in a patrol-wagon,\r\nand I telephoned to Hamilton Beamish to go and bail him out and bring\r\nhim along here. They ought to arrive at any moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hamilton Beamish and Mr. George Finch,\" said Ferris in the\r\ndoorway. And the nicely-graduated way in which he spoke the two names\r\nwould have conveyed at once to any intelligent listener that Hamilton\r\nBeamish was an honoured guest but that he had been forced to admit\r\nGeorge Finch--against all the promptings of his better nature--because\r\nMr. Beamish had told him to and he had been quelled by the man's cold,\r\nspectacled eye.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are,\" said Hamilton Beamish heartily. \"Just in time, I\r\nperceive, to join in a jolly family discussion.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington looked bleachingly at George, who was trying to hide\r\nbehind a gate-leg table. For George Finch was conscious of not looking\r\nhis best. Nothing so disorders the outer man as the process of being\r\narrested and hauled to the coop by a _posse_ of New York gendarmes.\r\nGeorge's collar was hanging loose from its stud: his waistcoat lacked\r\nthree buttons: and his right eye was oddly discoloured where a\r\nhigh-minded officer, piqued by the fact that he should have collected\r\ncrowds by scattering dollar-bills and even more incensed by the\r\ndiscovery that he had scattered all he possessed and had none left, had\r\ngiven him a hearty buffet during the ride in the patrol-wagon.\r\n\r\n\"There is no discussion,\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"You do not suppose I\r\nam going to allow my daughter to marry a man like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut-tut!\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"George is not looking his best just\r\nnow, but a wash and brush-up will do wonders.... What is your objection\r\nto George?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington was at a momentary loss for a reply. Anybody, suddenly\r\nquestioned as to why they disliked a slug or a snake or a black-beetle,\r\nmight find it difficult on the spur of the moment to analyse and\r\ndissect their prejudice. Mrs. Waddington looked on her antipathy to\r\nGeorge Finch as one of those deep, natural, fundamental impulses which\r\nthe sensible person takes for granted. Broadly speaking, she objected\r\nto George because he was George. It was, as it were, his essential\r\nGeorgeness that offended her. But, seeing that she was expected to be\r\nanalytical, she forced her mind to the task.\r\n\r\n\"He is an artist.\"\r\n\r\n\"So was Michael Angelo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never met him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a very great man.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington raised her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"I completely fail to understand, Mr. Beamish, why, when we are\r\ndiscussing this young man here with the black eye and the dirty collar,\r\nyou should persist in diverting the conversation to the subject of a\r\nperfect stranger like this Mr. Angelo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely wished to point out,\" said Hamilton Beamish stiffly, \"that\r\nthe fact that he is an artist does not necessarily damn a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no need,\" retorted Mrs. Waddington with even greater\r\nstiffness, \"to use bad language.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, George is a rotten artist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rotten to the core, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" said Hamilton Beamish, flushing slightly at the lapse from\r\nthe English Pure into which emotion had led him, \"he paints so badly\r\nthat you can hardly call him an artist at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so?\" said George, speaking for the first time and speaking\r\nnastily.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure George is one of the cleverest artists living,\" cried Molly.\r\n\r\n\"He is not,\" thundered Hamilton Beamish. \"He is an incompetent amateur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"And consequently can never hope to\r\nmake money.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish's eyes lit up behind their spectacles.\r\n\r\n\"Is that your chief objection?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Is what my chief objection?\"\r\n\r\n\"That George has no money?\"\r\n\r\n\"But....\" began George.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"I ask you, Mrs. Waddington, would\r\nyou give your consent to this marriage if my friend George Finch were a\r\nwealthy man?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a waste of time to discuss such....\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then allow me to inform you,\" said Hamilton Beamish, triumphantly,\r\n\"that George Finch is an exceedingly wealthy man. His uncle Thomas,\r\nwhose entire fortune he inherited two years ago, was Finch, Finch,\r\nFinch, Butterfield and Finch, the well-known Corporation Law firm.\r\nGeorge, my boy, let me congratulate you. All is well. Mrs. Waddington\r\nhas withdrawn her objections.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington snorted, but it was the snort of a beaten woman,\r\noutgeneralled by a superior intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"But....\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Hamilton Beamish raised his hand. \"You cannot go back on what you\r\nsaid. You stated in distinct terms that, if George had money, you would\r\nconsent to the marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, anyway, I don't know what all the fuss is about,\" said Molly.\r\n\"Because I am going to marry him, no matter what anybody says.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington capitulated.\r\n\r\n\"Very well! I am nobody, I see. What I say does not matter in the\r\nslightest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\" said George reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"Mother?\" echoed Mrs. Waddington, starting violently.\r\n\r\n\"Now that everything is so happily settled, of course I regard you in\r\nthat light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you?\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do,\" said George.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington sniffed unpleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"I have been overwhelmed and forced into consenting to a marriage of\r\nwhich I strongly disapprove,\" she said, \"but I may be permitted to say\r\none word. I have a feeling that this wedding will never take place.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" said Molly. \"Of course it will take place. Why\r\nshouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington sniffed again.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch,\" she said, \"though a very incompetent artist, has lived for\r\na considerable time in the heart of Greenwich Village and mingled daily\r\nwith Bohemians of both sexes and questionable morals....\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you hinting?\" demanded Molly.\r\n\r\n\"I am not hinting,\" replied Mrs. Waddington with dignity. \"I am saying.\r\nAnd what I am saying is this. Do not come to _me_ for sympathy if\r\nthis Finch of yours turns out to have the sort of moral code which you\r\nmight expect in one who deliberately and of his own free-will goes and\r\nlives near Washington Square. I say again, that I have a presentiment\r\nthat this marriage will never take place. I had a similar presentiment\r\nregarding the wedding of my sister-in-law and a young man named John\r\nPorter. I said, 'I feel that this wedding will never take place.' And\r\nevents proved me right. John Porter, at the very moment when he was\r\nabout to enter the church, was arrested on a charge of bigamy.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge uttered protesting noises.\r\n\r\n\"But my morals are above reproach.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that, as far as women are concerned, I can scarcely tell\r\none from another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" replied Mrs. Waddington, \"what John Porter said when they\r\nasked him why he had married six different girls.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now that everything is satisfactorily settled....\"\r\n\r\n\"For the moment,\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Now that everything is satisfactorily settled,\" proceeded Hamilton\r\nBeamish, \"I will be leaving you. I have to get back and dress. I am\r\nspeaking at a dinner of the Great Neck Social and Literary Society\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe silence that followed his departure was followed by a question from\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Molly, my dear,\" said Sigsbee H., \"touching on that necklace. Now that\r\nthis splendid young fellow turns out to be very rich, you will not want\r\nto sell it, of course?\"\r\n\r\nMolly reflected.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think I will. I never liked it much. It's too showy. I shall\r\nsell it and buy something very nice with the money for George. A lot of\r\ndiamond pins or watches or motor-cars or something. And, whenever we\r\nlook at them we will think of you, daddy dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Mr. Waddington huskily. \"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seldom in my life,\" observed Mrs. Waddington, coming abruptly out of\r\nthe brooding coma into which she had sunk, \"have I ever had a stronger\r\npresentiment than the one to which I alluded just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother!\" said George.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish, gathering up his hat in the hall, became aware that\r\nsomething was pawing at his sleeve. He looked down and perceived\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Say!\" said Sigsbee H. in a hushed undertone. \"Say, listen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is anything the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet your tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles something's the matter,\"\r\nwhispered Sigsbee H. urgently. \"Say, listen. Can I have a word with\r\nyou? I want your advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will you be before you start out for this Hoboken Clam-Bake\r\nof yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dinner of the Great Neck Social and Literary Society, to which I\r\nimagine you to allude, is at eight o'clock. I shall motor down, leaving\r\nmy apartment at twenty minutes past seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's no good trying to see you to-night. Say, listen. Will you be\r\nhome to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" said Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen!\" said Sigsbee H. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Proceed,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am all attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen!\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish glanced at his watch impatiently. Even at its normal\r\nlevel of imbecility, the conversation of Sigsbee H. Waddington was apt\r\nto jar upon his critical mind, and now, it seemed to him, the other was\r\nplumbing depths which even he had never reached before.\r\n\r\n\"I can give you seven minutes,\" he said. \"At the end of that period of\r\ntime I must leave you. I am speaking at a luncheon of the Young Women\r\nWriters of America. You came here, I gather, to make a communication to\r\nme. Make it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen!\" said Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish compressed his lips sternly. He had heard parrots with\r\na more intelligent flow of conversation. He was conscious of a strange\r\ndesire to beat this man over the head with a piece of lead-piping.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen!\" said Sigsbee H. \"I've gone and got myself into the devil\r\nof a jam.\"\r\n\r\n\"A position of embarrassment?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said it!\"\r\n\r\n\"State nature of same,\" said Hamilton Beamish, looking at his watch\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington glanced quickly and nervously over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"It's like this. You heard Molly say yesterday she was going to sell\r\nthose pearls.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, say, listen!\" said Mr. Waddington, lowering his voice and\r\nlooking apprehensively about him once more, \"They aren't pearls!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fakes!\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish winced.\r\n\r\n\"You mean imitation stones?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I do mean. What am I going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly simple. Bring an action against the jeweller who sold them\r\nto you as genuine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they were genuine then. You don't seem to get the position.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not.\"\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington moistened his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard of the Finer and Better Motion Picture Company of\r\nHollywood, Cal.?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindly keep to the point. My time is limited.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the point. Some time ago a guy who said he was a friend of\r\nmine tipped me off that this company was a wow.\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\"\r\n\r\n\"A winner. He said it was going to be big and advised me to come in on\r\nthe ground floor. The chance of a lifetime, he said it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hadn't any money,--not a cent. Still, I didn't want to miss a\r\ngood thing like that, so I sat down and thought. I thought and thought\r\nand thought. And then suddenly something seemed to say to me 'Why not?'\r\nThat pearl necklace, I mean. There it was, you get me, just sitting and\r\ndoing nothing and I only needed the money for a few weeks till this\r\nCompany started to clean up and ... well, to cut a long story short, I\r\nsneaked the necklace away, had the fake stones put in, sold the others,\r\nbought the stock, and there I was, so I thought, all hotsy-totsy.\"\r\n\r\n\"All--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hotsy-totsy. It seemed to me that I was absolutely hotsy-totsy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what has caused you to revise this opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I met a man the other day who said these shares weren't worth a\r\nbean. I've got 'em here. Take a look at them.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish scrutinised the documents with distaste.\r\n\r\n\"The man was right,\" he said. \"When you first mentioned the name of\r\nthe company, it seemed familiar. I now recall why. Mrs. Henrietta Byng\r\nMasterson, the president of the Great Neck Social and Literary Society,\r\nwas speaking to me of it last night. She also had bought shares and\r\nmentioned the fact with regret. I should say at a venture that these of\r\nyours are worth possibly ten dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I gave fifty thousand for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your books will show a loss of forty-nine thousand, nine hundred\r\nand ninety. I am sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what am I to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Write it off to experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"But hell's bells! Don't you understand? What's going to happen when\r\nMolly tries to sell that necklace and it comes out that it's a fake?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish shook his head. With most of the ordinary problems of\r\nlife he was prepared to cope, but this, he frankly admitted, was beyond\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"My wife'll murder me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came here, thinking that you would be able to suggest something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Short of stealing the necklace and dropping it in the Hudson River, I\r\nfear I can think of no solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"You used to be a brainy sort of gink,\" said Mr. Waddington\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"No human brain could devise a way out of this impasse. You can but\r\nwait events and trust to Time the great healer eventually to mend\r\nmatters.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a lot of help.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish shrugged his shoulders. Sigsbee H. Waddington regarded\r\nthe stock-certificates malevolently.\r\n\r\n\"If the stuff's no good,\" he said, \"what do they want to put all those\r\ndollar-signs on the back for? Misleading people! And look at that seal.\r\nAnd all those signatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" said Hamilton Beamish. He moved to the window and leaned\r\nout, sniffing the summer air. \"What a glorious day.\"\r\n\r\n\"No it isn't,\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever by any chance met Madame Eulalie, Mrs. Waddington's\r\npalmist?\" asked Hamilton Beamish dreamily.\r\n\r\n\"Darn all palmists!\" said Sigsbee H. Waddington. \"What am I going to do\r\nabout this stock?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already told you that there is nothing that you can do, short\r\nof stealing the necklace.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be something. What would you do if you were me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Run away to Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't run away to Europe. I haven't any money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then shoot yourself ... stand in front of a train ... anything,\r\nanything,\" said Hamilton Beamish impatiently. \"And now I must really\r\ngo. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye. Thanks for being such a help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"Don't mention it. I am always\r\ndelighted to be of any assistance, always.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a last soulful glance at the photograph on the mantelpiece and\r\nleft the room. Mr. Waddington could hear him singing an old French\r\nlove-song as he waited for the elevator, and the sound seemed to set\r\nthe seal upon his gloom and despair.\r\n\r\n\"You big stiff!\" said Mr. Waddington morosely.\r\n\r\nHe flung himself into a chair and gave himself up to melancholy\r\nmeditation. For a while, all he could think of was how much he disliked\r\nHamilton Beamish. There was a man who went about the place pretending\r\nto be clever, and yet the moment you came to him with a childishly\r\nsimple problem which he ought to have been able to solve in half a\r\ndozen different ways in five minutes, he could do nothing but say he\r\nwas sorry and advise a fellow to stand in front of trains and shoot\r\nhimself. What on earth was the use of trying to be optimistic about a\r\nworld which contained people like Hamilton Beamish?\r\n\r\nAnd that idiotic suggestion of his about stealing the necklace! How\r\ncould he possibly...?\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington sat up in his chair. There was a gleam in his\r\neyes. He snorted. Was it such an idiotic suggestion, after all?\r\n\r\nHe gazed into the future. At the moment the necklace was in safe\r\ncustody at the bank, but, if Molly was going to marry this young Pinch,\r\nit would presumably be taken from there and placed on exhibition among\r\nthe other wedding-presents. So that ere long there would undeniably be\r\na time--say, the best part of a day--when a resolute man with a nimble\r\nset of fingers might....\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington sank back in his chair again. The light died out of\r\nhis eyes. Philosophers tell us that no man really knows himself: but\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington knew himself well enough to be aware that he\r\nfell short by several miles of the nerve necessary for such an action.\r\nStealing necklaces is no job for an amateur. You cannot suddenly\r\ntake to it in middle life without any previous preparation. Every\r\nsuccessful stealer of necklaces has to undergo a rigorous and intensive\r\ntraining from early boyhood, starting with milk-cans and bags at\r\nrailway-stations and working his way up. What was needed for this very\r\ndelicate operation was a seasoned professional.\r\n\r\nAnd there, felt Sigsbee H. Waddington bitterly, you had in a nutshell\r\nthe thing that made life so difficult to live--the tragic problem\r\nof how to put your hand on the right specialist at the exact moment\r\nwhen you required him. All these reference-books like the Classified\r\nTelephone Directory omitted the vital trades,--the trades whose members\r\nwere of assistance in the real crisis of life. They told you where\r\nto find a Glass Beveller, as if anyone knew what to do with a Glass\r\nBeveller when they had got him. They gave you the address of Yeast\r\nProducers and Designers of Quilts: but what was the good of a producer\r\nof yeast when you wanted some one who would produce a jemmy and break\r\ninto a house or a designer of quilts when what you required was a man\r\nwho could design a satisfactory scheme for stealing an imitation-pearl\r\nnecklace?\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington groaned in sheer bitterness of spirit. The irony of\r\nthings afflicted him sorely. Every day the papers talked about the\r\nCrime Wave: every day a thousand happy crooks were making off in\r\nautomobiles with a thousand bundles of swag: and yet here he was, in\r\nurgent need of one of these crooks, and he didn't know where to look\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nA deprecating tap sounded on the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in!\" shouted Mr. Waddington irritably.\r\n\r\nHe looked up and perceived about seventy-five inches of bony policeman\r\nshambling over the threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, if I seem to intrude,\" said the policeman,\r\nbeginning to recede. \"I came to see Mr. Beamish. I should have made an\r\nappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Don't go.\" Said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\nThe policeman paused doubtfully at the door.\r\n\r\n\"But as Mr. Beamish is not at home....\"\r\n\r\n\"Come right in and have a chat. Sit down and take the weight off your\r\nfeet. My name is Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine is Garroway,\" replied the officer, bowing courteously.\r\n\r\n\"Pleased to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happy to meet you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a good cigar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should enjoy it above all things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder where Mr. Beamish keeps them,\" said Sigsbee H., rising and\r\nrouting about the room. \"Ah, here we are. Match?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a match, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\"\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington resumed his seat and regarded the other\r\naffectionately. An instant before, he had been bemoaning the fact that\r\nhe did not know where to lay his hands on a crook, and here, sent from\r\nheaven, was a man who was probably a walking directory of malefactors.\r\n\r\n\"I like policemen,\" said Mr. Waddington affably.\r\n\r\n\"That is very gratifying, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Always have. Shows how honest I am, ha ha! If I were a crook, I\r\nsuppose I'd be scared stiff, sitting here talking to you.\" Mr.\r\nWaddington drew bluffly at his cigar. \"I guess you come across a lot of\r\ncriminals, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the great drawback to the policeman's life,\" assented Officer\r\nGarroway, sighing. \"One meets them on all sides. Only last night, when\r\nI was searching for a vital adjective, I was called upon to arrest an\r\nuncouth person who had been drinking home-brewed hootch. He soaked me\r\non the jaw, and inspiration left me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't that give you a soft-pine finish!\" said Mr. Waddington\r\nsympathetically. \"But what I was referring to was real crooks. Fellows\r\nwho get into houses and steal pearl necklaces. Ever met any of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I meet a great number. In pursuance of his duty, a policeman is forced\r\nagainst his will to mix with all sorts of questionable people. It\r\nmay be that my profession biases me, but I have a hearty dislike for\r\nthieves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, if there were no thieves, there would be no policemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Supply and demand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington blew a cloud of smoke.\r\n\r\n\"I'm kind of interested in crooks,\" he said. \"I'd like to meet a few.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that you would not find the experience enjoyable,\" said\r\nOfficer Garroway, shaking his head. \"They are unpleasant, illiterate\r\nmen with little or no desire to develop their souls. I make an\r\nexception, I should mention, however, in the case of Mr. Mullett, who\r\nseemed a nice sort of fellow. I wish I could have seen more of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mullett? Who's he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is an ex-convict, sir, who works for Mr. Finch in the apartment\r\nupstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say! An ex-convict and works for Mr. Finch? What was his\r\nline?\"\r\n\r\n\"Inside burglary jobs, sir. I understand, however, that he has reformed\r\nand is now a respectable member of society.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, he was a burglar once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Officer Garroway, who was trying to find a good\r\nsynonym for one of the adjectives in the poem on which he was occupied,\r\nstared thoughtfully at the ceiling. Mr. Waddington chewed his cigar\r\nintensely.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen!\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\" said the policeman, coming out of his reverie with a start.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said Mr. Waddington, \"suppose, just for the sake of\r\nargument, that a wicked person wanted a crook to do a horrible,\r\nnefarious job for him, would he have to pay him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly, sir. These men are very mercenary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pay him much?\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine a few hundred dollars. It would depend on the magnitude of\r\nthe crime contemplated, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"A few hundred dollars!\"\r\n\r\n\"Two, perhaps, or three.\"\r\n\r\nSilence fell once more. Officer Garroway resumed his inspection of the\r\nceiling. What he wanted was something signifying the aspect of the\r\nstreets of New York, and he had used \"sordid\" in line two. \"Scabrous!\"\r\nThat was the word. He was rolling it over his tongue when he became\r\naware that his companion was addressing him.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington's eyes were glittering in a peculiar way. He leaned\r\nforward and tapped Officer Garroway on the knee.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen! I like your face, Larrabee.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Garroway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind about your name. It's your face I like. Say, listen, do you\r\nwant to make a pile of money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't mind telling you that I've taken a fancy to you, and\r\nI'm going to do something for you that I wouldn't do for many people.\r\nHave you ever heard of the Finer and Better Motion Picture Company of\r\nHollywood, Cal.?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the wonderful thing,\" said Mr. Waddington in a sort of ecstasy.\r\n\"Nobody's ever heard of it. It isn't one of those worn-out propositions\r\nlike the Famous Players that everybody's sick and tired of. It's new.\r\nAnd do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to let you have a block\r\nof stock in it for a quite nominal figure. It would be insulting you to\r\ngive it to you for nothing, which is what I'd like to do, of course.\r\nBut it amounts to the same thing. This stock here is worth thousands\r\nand thousands of dollars, and you shall have it for three hundred. Have\r\nyou got three hundred?\" asked Mr. Waddington, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I have that sum, but....\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington waved his cigar.\r\n\r\n\"Don't use that word 'but'! I know what you're trying to say. You're\r\ntrying to tell me, I'm robbing myself. I know I am, and what of it?\r\nWhat's money to me? The way I look at it is that, when a man has made\r\nhis pile, like me, and has got enough to keep his wife and family in\r\nluxury, the least he can do as a lover of humanity is to let the rest\r\ngo to folks who'll appreciate it. Now you probably need money as much\r\nas the rest of them, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then here you are,\" said Mr. Waddington, brandishing the bundle of\r\nstock-certificates. \"This is where you get it. You can take it from me\r\nthat the Finer and Better Motion Picture Company is the biggest thing\r\nsince Marconi invented the victrola.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway took the stock and fondled it thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"It's certainly very nicely engraved,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You bet it is! And look at those dollar-signs on the back. Look at\r\nthat seal. Cast your eye over those signatures. Those mean something.\r\nAnd you know what the motion-pictures are. A bigger industry than the\r\nbeef business. And the Finer and Better is the greatest proposition of\r\nthem all. It isn't like other companies. For one thing, it hasn't been\r\npaying out all its money in dividends.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir! Not wasted a cent that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all still there?\"\r\n\r\n\"All still there. And, what's more, it hasn't released a single\r\npicture.\"\r\n\r\n\"All still there?\"\r\n\r\n\"All still there. Lying on the shelves,--dozens of them. And then\r\ntake the matter of overhead expenses,--the thing that cripples all\r\nthese other film-companies. Big studios ... expensive directors ...\r\nhigh-salaried stars....\"\r\n\r\n\"All still there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir! That's the point. They're not there. The Finer and Better\r\nMotion Picture Company hasn't any of these D. W. Griffiths and Gloria\r\nSwansons eating away its capital. It hasn't even a studio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even a studio?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. Nothing but a company. I tell you it's big!\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway's mild blue eyes widened.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime,\" he agreed.\r\n\r\n\"The opportunity of a dozen lifetimes,\" said Mr. Waddington. \"And\r\nthat's the way to get on in the world--by grabbing your opportunities.\r\nWhy, what's Big Ben but a wrist-watch that saw its chance and made\r\ngood?\" Mr. Waddington paused. His forehead wrinkled. He snatched the\r\nbundle of stock from his companion's grasp and made a movement towards\r\nhis pocket. \"No!\" he said, \"No! I can't do it. I can't let you have it,\r\nafter all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It's too big.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but, Mr. Waddington....\"\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington seemed to come out of a trance. He shook himself\r\nand stared at the policeman as if he were saying \"Where am I?\" He\r\nheaved a deep, remorseful sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't money the devil!\" he said. \"Isn't it terrible the way it saps\r\nall a fellow's principles and good resolutions! Sheer greed, that was\r\nwhat was the matter with me, when I said I wouldn't let you have this\r\nstock. Sheer, grasping greed. Here am I, with millions in the bank, and\r\nthe first thing you know I'm trying to resist a generous impulse to do\r\na fellow human-being, whose face I like, a kindly act. It's horrible!\"\r\nHe wrenched the bundle from his pocket and threw it to the policeman.\r\n\"Here, take it before I weaken again. Give me the three hundred quick\r\nand let me get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how to thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't thank me, don't thank me. One--two--three,\" said Mr. Waddington,\r\ncounting the bills. \"Don't thank me at all. It's a pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nUpstairs, while the conversation just recorded was in progress,\r\nFrederick Mullett was entertaining his fiancée, Fanny Welch, to a light\r\ncollation in the kitchen of George Finch's apartment. It is difficult\r\nfor a man to look devotional while his mouth is full of cold beef and\r\nchutney,--but not impossible, for Mullett was doing it now. He gazed at\r\nFanny very much as George Finch had gazed at Molly Waddington, Hamilton\r\nBeamish at Madame Eulalie, and as a million other young men in New York\r\nand its outskirts were or would shortly be gazing at a million other\r\nyoung women. Love had come rather late to Frederick Mullett, for his\r\nhad been a busy life, but it had come to stay.\r\n\r\nExternally, Fanny Welch appeared not unworthy of his devotion. She was\r\na pretty little thing with snapping black eyes and a small face. The\r\nthing you noticed about her first was the slim shapeliness of her hands\r\nwith their long, sensitive fingers. One of the great advantages of\r\nbeing a pickpocket is that you do have nice hands.\r\n\r\n\"I like this place,\" said Fanny, looking about her.\r\n\r\n\"Do you, honey?\" said Mullett tenderly. \"I was hoping you would.\r\nBecause I've got a secret for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is where you and me are going to spend our honeymoon!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, in this kitchen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not. We'll have the run of the whole apartment, with the\r\nroof thrown in.\"\r\n\r\n\"What'll Mr. Finch have to say to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't know, pettie. You see, Mr. Finch has just gone and got\r\nengaged to be married himself, and he'll be off on his honeymoon-trip,\r\nso the whole place'll be ours for ever so long. What do you think of\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take and show you the place in a minute or two. It's the best\r\nstudio-apartment for miles around. There's a nice large sitting-room\r\nthat looks on to the roof, with French windows so that you can stroll\r\nout and take the air when you like. And there's a sleeping-porch on the\r\nroof, in case the weather's warm. And a bath H. and C., with shower.\r\nIt's the snuggest place you'll ever want to find, and you and I can\r\nstay perched up here like two little birds in a nest. And, when we've\r\nfinished honeymooning, we'll go down to Long Island and buy a little\r\nduck-farm and live happy ever after.\"\r\n\r\nFanny looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n\"Can you see me on a duck-farm, Freddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I?\" Mullett's eyes beamed adoration. \"You bet I can see you\r\nthere,--standing in a gingham apron on the old brick path between the\r\nhollyhocks, watching little Frederick romping under the apple-tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Little _who_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Little Frederick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh? And did you notice little Fanny clinging to my skirts?\"\r\n\r\n\"So she is. And William John in his cradle on the porch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we'd better stop looking for awhile,\" said Fanny. \"Our\r\nfamily's growing too fast.\"\r\n\r\nMullett sighed ecstatically.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't it sound quiet and peaceful after the stormy lives we've led.\r\nThe quacking of the ducks.... The droning of the bees.... Put back that\r\nspoon, dearie. You know it doesn't belong to you.\"\r\n\r\nFanny removed the spoon from the secret places of her dress and eyed it\r\nwith a certain surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Now, how did that get there?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You snitched it up, sweetness,\" said Mullett gently. \"Your little\r\nfingers just hovered for a moment like little bees over a flower, and\r\nthe next minute the thing was gone. It was beautiful to watch, dearie,\r\nbut put it back. You've done with all that sort of thing now, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I have,\" said Fanny wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"You don't guess you have, precious,\" corrected her husband-to-be. \"You\r\nknow you have. Same as I've done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you really on the level now, Freddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm as honest as the day is long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Work at nights, eh? Mullett, the human moth. Goes through his master's\r\nclothes like a jealous wife.\"\r\n\r\nMullett laughed indulgently.\r\n\r\n\"The same little Fanny! How you do love to tease. Yes, precious, I'm\r\nthrough with the game for good. I wouldn't steal a bone collar-stud\r\nnow, not if my mother came and begged me on her bended knee. All I want\r\nis my little wife and my little home in the country.\"\r\n\r\nFanny frowned pensively.\r\n\r\n\"You don't think it'll be kind of quiet down on that duck-farm? Kind of\r\nslow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Slow?\" said Mullett, shocked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe not. But we're retiring from business awful young, Freddy.\"\r\n\r\nA look of concern came into Mullett's face.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean you still have a hankering for the old game?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what if I do?\" said Fanny defiantly. \"You do, too, if you'd only\r\ncome clean and admit it.\"\r\n\r\nThe look of concern changed to one of dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" said Mullett. \"I give you my word, Fanny, that\r\nthere isn't the job on earth that could tempt me now. And I do wish you\r\nwould bring yourself to feel the same, honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not saying I would bother with anything that wasn't really\r\nbig. But, honest to goodness, Freddy, it would be a crime to side-step\r\nanything worthwhile, if it came along. It isn't as if we had all\r\nthe money in the world. I've picked up some nice little things at the\r\nstores and I suppose you've kept some of the stuff you got away with,\r\nbut outside of that we've nothing but the bit of cash we've managed to\r\nsave. We've got to be practical.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sweetie, think of the awful chances you'd be taking of getting\r\npinched.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid. If they ever do nab me, I've got a spiel about my poor\r\nold mother....\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't got a mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who said I had?... a spiel about my poor old mother that would draw\r\ntears from the Woolworth Building. Listen! 'Don't turn me over to the\r\npolice, mister, I only did it for ma's sake. If you was out of work for\r\nweeks and starvin' and you had to sit and watch your old ma bendin'\r\nover the wash-tubs....'\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Fanny, please! I can't bear it even though I know it's just a\r\ngame. I.... Hello! Somebody at the front door. Probably only a model\r\nwanting to know if Mr. Finch has a job for her. You wait here, honey.\r\nI'll get rid of her and be back in half a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nMore than twenty times that period had elapsed, however, before\r\nFrederick Mullett returned to the kitchen. He found his bride-to-be in\r\na considerably less amiable mood than that in which he had left her.\r\nShe was standing with folded arms, and the temperature of the room had\r\ngone down a number of degrees.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty girl?\" she inquired frostily, as Mullett crossed the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said you were going to send that model away in half a minute,\r\nand I've been waiting here nearer a quarter of an hour,\" said Fanny,\r\nverifying this statement by a glance at the wrist-watch, the absence of\r\nwhich from their stock was still an unsolved mystery to a prosperous\r\nfirm of jewellers on Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nMullett clasped her in his arms. It was a matter of some difficulty,\r\nfor she was not responsive, but he did it.\r\n\r\n\"It was not a model, darling. It was a man. A guy with grey hair and a\r\nred face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh? What did he want?\"\r\n\r\nMullett's already somewhat portly frame seemed to expand, as if with\r\nsome deep emotion.\r\n\r\n\"He came to tempt me, Fanny.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tempt you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what he did. Wanted to know if my name was Mullett, and two\r\nseconds after I had said it was he offered me three hundred dollars to\r\nperpetrate a crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did? What crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't wait for him to tell me. I spurned his offer and came away.\r\nThat'll show you if I've reformed or not. A nice, easy, simple job he\r\nsaid it was, that I could do in a couple of minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you spurned him, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly spurned him. I spurned him good and plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then you came away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Came right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then listen here,\" said Fanny in a steely voice, \"it don't seem to\r\nme that your times add up right. You say he made you this offer two\r\nseconds after he heard your name. Well, why did it take you a quarter\r\nof an hour to get back to this kitchen? If you want to know what I\r\nthink, it wasn't a red-faced man with grey hair at all,--it was one of\r\nthese Washington Square vamps and you were flirting with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fanny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've read Gingery Stories, and I know what it's like down here\r\nin Bohemia with all these artists and models and everything.\"\r\n\r\nMullett drew himself up.\r\n\r\n\"Your suspicions pain me, Fanny. If you care to step out on to the\r\nroof, you can peek in at the sitting-room window and see him for\r\nyourself. He's waiting there for me to bring him a drink. The reason\r\nI was so long coming back was that it took him ten minutes before he\r\nasked my name. Up till then he just sat and spluttered.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Take me out on the roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Mullett, a moment later. \"Now perhaps you'll believe me.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the French windows of the sitting-room there was undeniably\r\nvisible a man of precisely the appearance described. Fanny was\r\nremorseful.\r\n\r\n\"Did I wrong my poor little Freddy, then?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry. There!\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed him. Mullett melted immediately.\r\n\r\n\"I must go back and get that drink,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And I must be getting along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not yet,\" begged Mullett.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I must. I've got to look in at one or two of the stores.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fanny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a girl's got to have her trousseau, hasn't she?\"\r\n\r\nMullett sighed.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be very careful, precious?\" he said anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I'm always careful. Don't you worry about me.\"\r\n\r\nMullett retired, and Fanny, blowing a parting kiss from her pretty\r\nfingers, passed through the door leading to the stairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps five minutes later, while Mullett sat dreaming golden\r\ndreams in the kitchen and Sigsbee H. Waddington sat sipping his\r\nwhisky-and-soda in the sitting-room, that a sudden tap on the French\r\nwindow caused the latter to give a convulsive leap and spill most of\r\nthe liquid down the front of his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nHe looked up. A girl was standing outside the window, and from her\r\ngestures he gathered that she was requesting him to open it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Sigsbee H. Waddington could bring himself to\r\ndo so. There exist, no doubt, married men of the baser sort who would\r\nhave enjoyed the prospect of a _tête-à-tête_ chat with a girl\r\nwith snapping black eyes who gesticulated at them through windows:\r\nbut Sigsbee Waddington was not one of them. By nature and training he\r\nwas circumspect to a degree. So for awhile he merely stood and stared\r\nat Fanny. It was not until her eyes became so imperative as to be\r\npractically hypnotic that he brought himself to undo the latch.\r\n\r\n\"And about time, too,\" said Fanny, with annoyance, stepping softly into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want a little talk with you. What's all this I hear about you asking\r\npeople to perpetrate crimes for you?\"\r\n\r\nSigsbee Waddington's conscience was in such a feverish condition by now\r\nthat this speech affected him as deeply as the explosion of a pound of\r\ndynamite would have done. His vivid imagination leaped immediately to\r\nthe supposition that this girl who seemed so intimate with his private\r\naffairs was one of those Secret Service investigation agents who do so\r\nmuch to mar the comfort of the amateur in crime.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he croaked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shucks!\" said Fanny impatiently. She was a business girl and\r\ndisliked this beating about the bush. \"Freddy Mullett told me all about\r\nit. You want some one to do a job for you and he turned you down. Well,\r\ntake a look at the understudy. I'm here, and, if the job's in my line,\r\nlead me to it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington continued to eye her warily. He had now decided that she\r\nwas trying to trap him into a damaging admission. He said nothing, but\r\nbreathed stertorously.\r\n\r\nFanny, a sensitive girl, misunderstood his silence. She interpreted the\r\nlook in his eye to indicate distrust of the ability of a woman worker\r\nto deputise for the male.\r\n\r\n\"If it's anything Freddy Mullett could do, I can do it,\" she said. She\r\nseemed to Mr. Waddington to flicker for a moment. \"See here!\" she said.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Waddington's fascinated gaze she held up between her\r\ndelicate fingers a watch and chain.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"What does it look like?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington knew exactly what it looked like. He felt his waistcoat\r\ndazedly.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't see you take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody don't ever see me take it,\" said Fanny proudly, stating a\r\nprofound truth. \"Well, then, now you've witnessed the demonstration,\r\nperhaps you'll believe me when I say that I'm not so worse. If Freddy\r\ncan do it, I can do it.\"\r\n\r\nA cool, healing wave of relief poured over Sigsbee H. Waddington's\r\nharassed soul. He perceived that he had wronged his visitor. She was\r\nnot a detective, after all, but a sweet, womanly woman who went about\r\nlifting things out of people's pockets so deftly that they never saw\r\nthem go. Just the sort of girl he had been wanting to meet.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you can,\" he said fervently.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's the job?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want some one to steal a pearl necklace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the strong-room at the bank.\"\r\n\r\nFanny's mobile features expressed disappointment and annoyance.\r\n\r\n\"Then what's the use of talking about it? I'm not a safe-smasher. I'm a\r\ndelicately nurtured girl that never used an oxy-acetylene blowpipe in\r\nher life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but you don't understand,\" said Mr. Waddington hastily. \"When I\r\nsay that the necklace is in the strong-room, I mean that it is there\r\njust now. Eventually it will be taken out and placed among the other\r\nwedding-presents.\"\r\n\r\n\"This begins to look more like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can mention no names, of course....\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't expect you to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will simply say that A, to whom the necklace belongs, is\r\nshortly about to be married to B.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might have known it. Doing all those bridge problems together, they\r\nkind of got fond of one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my reasons for thinking that the wedding will take place down\r\nat Hempstead on Long Island, where C, A's stepmother, has her summer\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Why not in New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Mr. Waddington simply, \"I expressed a wish that it\r\nshould take place in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you got to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am D, C's husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the fellow who could fill a tank with water in six hours fifteen\r\nminutes while C was filling another in five hours, forty-five? Pleased\r\nto meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am now strongly in favour of the Hempstead idea,\" said Mr.\r\nWaddington. \"In New York it might be difficult to introduce you into\r\nthe house, whereas down at Hempstead you can remain concealed in the\r\ngarden till the suitable moment arrives. Down at Hempstead the presents\r\nwill be on view in the dining-room, which has French windows opening on\r\nto a lawn flanked with shrubberies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what I thought. I will, therefore, make a point to-night of\r\ninsisting that the wedding take place in New York, and the thing will\r\nbe definitely settled.\"\r\n\r\nFanny eyed him reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"It all seems kind of funny to me. If you're D and you're married to C\r\nand C is A's stepmother, you must be A's father. What do you want to go\r\nstealing your daughter's necklace for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen,\" said Mr. Waddington urgently, \"the first thing you've\r\ngot to get into your head is that you're not to ask questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only my girlish curiosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tie a can to it,\" begged Mr. Waddington. \"This is a delicate business,\r\nand the last thing I want is anybody snooping into motives and first\r\ncauses. Just you go ahead, like a nice girl, and get that necklace and\r\npass it over to me when nobody's looking, and then put the whole matter\r\nout of your pretty little head and forget about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you say. And now, coming down to it, what is there in it for\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not nearly enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all I've got.\"\r\n\r\nFanny meditated. Three hundred dollars, though a meagre sum, was three\r\nhundred dollars. You could always use three hundred dollars when you\r\nwere furnishing, and the job, as outlined, seemed simple.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You'll do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good girl,\" said Mr. Waddington. \"Where can I find you when I want\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's my address.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll send you a line. You've got the thing clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. I hang about in the bushes till there's nobody around, and then\r\nI slip into the room and snitch the necklace....\"\r\n\r\n\"... and hand it over to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be waiting in the garden just outside, and I'll meet you the\r\nmoment you come out. The very moment. Thus,\" said Mr. Waddington with a\r\nquiet, meaning look at his young friend, \"avoiding any rannygazoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by rannygazoo?\" said Fanny warmly.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" said Mr. Waddington with a deprecating wave of the\r\nhand. \"Just rannygazoo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, as everybody knows, many ways of measuring time: and right\r\nthrough the ages learned men have argued heatedly in favour of their\r\ndifferent systems. Hipparchus of Rhodes sneered every time anybody\r\nmentioned Marinus of Tyre to him: and the views of Ahmed Ibn Abdallah\r\nof Baghdad gave Purbach and Regiomontanus the laugh of their lives.\r\nPurbach in his bluff way said the man must be a perfect ass: and when\r\nRegiomontanus, whose motto was Live and let live, urged that Ahmed Ibn\r\nwas just a young fellow trying to get along and ought not to be treated\r\ntoo harshly, Purbach said Was that so? and Regiomontanus said Yes, that\r\nwas so, and Purbach said that Regiomontanus made him sick.\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe measured time by means of altitudes, quadrants, azimuths,\r\ncross-staves, armillary spheres and parallactic rules: and, as he\r\noften said to his wife when winding up the azimuth and putting the\r\ncat out for the night, nothing could be fairer than that. And then\r\nin 1863 along came Dollen with his _Die Zeitbestimmung vermittelst\r\ndes tragbaren Durchgangsinstruments im Verticale des Polarsterns_\r\n(a best-seller in its day, subsequently filmed under the title Purple\r\nSins), and proved that Tycho, by mistaking an armillary sphere for a\r\nquadrant one night after a bump-supper at Copenhagen University, had\r\ngot his calculations all wrong.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that time cannot be measured. To George Finch, basking\r\nin the society of Molly Waddington, the next three weeks seemed but a\r\nflash. Whereas to Hamilton Beamish, with the girl he loved miles away\r\nin East Gilead, Idaho, it appeared incredible that any sensible person\r\ncould suppose that a day contained only twenty-four hours. There were\r\nmoments when Hamilton Beamish thought that something must have happened\r\nto the sidereal moon and that time was standing still.\r\n\r\nBut now the three weeks were up, and at any minute he might hear that\r\nshe was back in the metropolis. All day long he had been going about\r\nwith a happy smile on his face, and it was with a heart that leaped and\r\nsang from pure exuberance that he now turned to greet Officer Garroway,\r\nwho had just presented himself at his apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Garroway!\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"How goes it? What brings you\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understood you to say, sir,\" replied the policeman, \"that I was to\r\nbring you my poem when I had completed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course. I had forgotten all about it. Something seems to\r\nhave happened to my memory these days. So you have written your first\r\npoem, eh? All about love and youth and springtime, I suppose?... Excuse\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nThe telephone-bell had rung: and Hamilton Beamish, though the\r\ninstrument had disappointed him over and over again in the past few\r\ndays, leaped excitedly to snatch up the receiver.\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\nThis time there was no disappointment. The voice that spoke was the\r\nvoice he had heard so often in his dreams.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Beamish. I mean, Jimmy?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish drew a deep breath. And so overcome was he with sudden\r\njoy that for the first time since he had reached years of discretion he\r\ndrew it through the mouth.\r\n\r\n\"At last!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said 'At last!' Since you went away every minute has seemed an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it has to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that?\" breathed Hamilton Beamish fervently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That's the way minutes do seem in East Gilead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ah, yes,\" said Mr. Beamish, a little damped. \"When did you get\r\nback?\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter of an hour ago.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish's spirits soared once more.\r\n\r\n\"And you called me up at once!\" he said emotionally.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I wanted to know Mrs. Waddington's telephone number at Hempstead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that the only reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not. I wanted to hear how you were....\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you? Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"... and if you had missed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Missed you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I!\"\r\n\r\n\"How sweet of you. I should have thought you would have forgotten my\r\nvery existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guk!\" said Hamilton Beamish, completely overcome.\r\n\r\n\"Well, shall I tell you something? I missed you, too.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish drew another completely unscientific deep breath,\r\nand was about to pour his whole soul into the instrument in a manner\r\nthat would probably have fused the wire, when a breezy masculine voice\r\nsuddenly smote his ear-drum.\r\n\r\n\"Is that Ed?\" inquired the voice.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" thundered Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"This is Charley, Ed. Is it all right for Friday?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not!\" boomed Hamilton Beamish. \"Get off the wire, you blot! Go\r\naway, curse you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, if you want me to,\" said a sweet, feminine voice. \"But....\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon! I am sorry, sorry, sorry. A fiend in human shape\r\ngot on the wire,\" explained Mr. Beamish hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Well, what were we saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just going to....\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember. Mrs. Waddington's telephone number. I was looking through\r\nmy mail just now, and I found an invitation from Miss Waddington to her\r\nwedding. I see it's to-morrow. Fancy that!\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish would have preferred to speak of other things than\r\ntrivialities like George Finch's wedding, but he found it difficult to\r\nchange the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It is to take place at Hempstead to-morrow. George is staying\r\ndown there at the inn.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be a quiet country wedding, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I think Mrs. Waddington wants to hush George up as much as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor George!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going down by the one-thirty train. Couldn't we travel together?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure that I shall be able to go. I have an awful lot of\r\nthings to see to here, after being away so long. Shall we leave it\r\nopen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Hamilton Beamish resignedly. \"But, in any case, can\r\nyou dine with me to-morrow night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should love it.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish's eyes closed, and he snuffled for awhile.\r\n\r\n\"And what is Mrs. Waddington's number?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hempstead 4076.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll dine at the Purple Chicken, shall we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can always get it there, if they know you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they know you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Intimately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine! Well, good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish stood for a few moments in deep thought: then, turning\r\naway from the instrument, was astonished to perceive Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\n\"I'd forgotten all about you,\" he said. \"Let me see, what did you say\r\nyou had come for?\"\r\n\r\n\"To read you my poem, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, of course.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman coughed modestly.\r\n\r\n\"It is just a little thing, Mr. Beamish--a sort of study, you might\r\nsay, of the streets of New York as they appear to a policeman on his\r\nbeat. I would like to read it to you, if you will permit me.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway shifted his Adam's apple up and down once or twice:\r\nand, closing his eyes, began to recite in the special voice which he as\r\na rule reserved for giving evidence before magistrates.\r\n\r\n\"Streets!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the title, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. And also the first line.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish started.\r\n\r\n\"Is it _vers libre_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't it rhyme?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. I understood you to say that rhymes were an outworn\r\nconvention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I really say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, indeed, sir. And a great convenience I found it. It seems to\r\nmake poetry quite easy.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish looked at him perplexedly. He supposed he must have\r\nspoken the words which the other had quoted, and yet that he should\r\ndeliberately have wished to exclude a fellow-creature from the pure joy\r\nof rhyming \"heart\" with \"Cupid's dart\" seemed to him in his present\r\nuplifted state inconceivable.\r\n\r\n\"Odd!\" he said. \"Very odd. However, go on.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway went once more through the motions of swallowing\r\nsomething large and sharp, and shut his eyes again.\r\n\r\n    \"Streets!\r\n    Grim, relentless, sordid streets!\r\n    Miles of poignant streets,\r\n    East, West, North,\r\n    And stretching starkly South;\r\n    Sad, hopeless, dismal, cheerless, chilling\r\n    Streets!\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n    \"I pace the mournful streets\r\n    With aching heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"It is part of my duties, sir. Each patrolman is assigned a certain\r\nportion of the city as a beat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, why do you pace with aching heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is bleeding, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bleeding? You mean your heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. My heart is bleeding. I look at all the sordid gloom and\r\nsorrow and my heart bleeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go on. It all seems very peculiar to me, but go on.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I watch grey men slink past\r\n    With shifty, sidelong eyes\r\n    That gleam with murderous hate;\r\n    Lepers that prowl the streets.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish seemed about to speak, but checked himself.\r\n\r\n    \"Men who once were men,\r\n    Women that once were women,\r\n    Children like wizened apes,\r\n    And dogs that snarl and snap and growl and hate.\r\n    Streets!\r\n    Loathsome, festering streets!\r\n    I pace the scabrous streets\r\n    And long for death.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway stopped, and opened his eyes: and Hamilton Beamish,\r\ncrossing the room to where he stood, slapped him briskly on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I see it all,\" he said. \"What's wrong with you is liver. Tell me, have\r\nyou any local pain and tenderness?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"High temperature accompanied by shiverings and occasional rigours?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have not a hepatic abscess. All that is the matter, I\r\nimagine, is a slight sluggishness in the oesophageal groove, which can\r\nbe set right with calomel. My dear Garroway, it surely must be obvious\r\nto you that this poem of yours is all wrong. It is absurd for you to\r\npretend that you do not see a number of pleasant and attractive people\r\non your beat. The streets of New York are full of the most delightful\r\npersons. I have noticed them on all sides. The trouble is that you have\r\nbeen looking on them with a bilious eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you told me to be stark and poignant, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind. You must have misunderstood me. Starkness is\r\nquite out of place in poetry. A poem should be a thing of beauty and\r\ncharm and sentiment, and have as its theme the sweetest and divinest\r\nof all human emotions--Love. Only Love can inspire the genuine bard.\r\nLove, Garroway, is a fire that glows and enlarges, until it warms\r\nand beams upon multitudes, upon the universal heart of all, and so\r\nlights up the whole world and all Nature with its generous flames.\r\nShakespeare speaks of the ecstasy of love, and Shakespeare knew what he\r\nwas talking about. Ah, better to live in the lowliest cot, Garroway,\r\nthan pine in a palace alone. In peace, Love tunes the shepherd's reed:\r\nin war he mounts the warrior's steed. In halls, in gay attire is seen;\r\nin hamlets, dances on the green. Love rules the court, the camp, the\r\ngrove, and men below and saints above; for love is heaven and heaven is\r\nlove. Get these simple facts into your silly fat head, Garroway, and\r\nyou may turn out a poem worth reading. If, however, you are going to\r\ntake this absurd attitude about festering streets and scabrous dogs and\r\nthe rest of it, you are simply wasting your time and would be better\r\nemployed writing sub-titles for the motion-pictures.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway was not a man of forceful character. He bowed his head\r\nmeekly before the storm.\r\n\r\n\"I see what you mean, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope you did. I have put it plainly enough. I dislike\r\nintensely this modern tendency on the part of young writers to\r\nconcentrate on corpses and sewers and despair. They should be writing\r\nabout Love. I tell thee Love is nature's second sun, Garroway, causing\r\na spring of virtues where he shines. All love is sweet, given or\r\nreturned. Common as light is love, and its familiar voice wearies not\r\never. True love's the gift which God has given to man alone beneath the\r\nheaven. It is not--mark this, Garroway--it is not fantasy's hot fire,\r\nwhose wishes soon as granted die. It liveth not in fierce desire, with\r\nfierce desire it does not die. It is the secret sympathy, the silver\r\nlink, the silken tie, which heart to heart and mind to mind in body\r\nand in soul can bind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Exactly, Mr. Beamish. I quite see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go away and rewrite your poem on the lines I have indicated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Beamish.\" The policeman paused. \"Before I go, there is just\r\none other thing....\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no other thing in the world that matters except love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, there are the motion-pictures, to which you made a brief\r\nallusion just now, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"Garroway,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"I trust that you are not going to\r\ntell me that, after all I have done to try to make you a poet, you wish\r\nto sink to writing motion-picture scenarios?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. No, indeed. But some little time ago I happened to purchase\r\na block of stock in a picture company, and so far all my efforts\r\nto dispose of it have proved fruitless. I have begun to entertain\r\nmisgivings as to the value of these shares, and I thought that, while I\r\nwas here, I would ask you if you knew anything about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the company?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Finer and Better Motion Picture Company of Hollywood, California,\r\nMr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many shares did you buy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty thousand dollars worth.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much did you pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were stung,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"The stock is so much waste\r\npaper. Who sold it to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have unfortunately forgotten his name. He was a man with a red face\r\nand grey hair. And if I'd got him here now,\" said Officer Garroway with\r\nhonest warmth, \"I'd soak him so hard it would jolt his grandchildren.\r\nThe smooth, salve-slinging crocodile!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a curious thing,\" said Hamilton Beamish musingly, \"there seems\r\nto be floating at the back of my consciousness a sort of nebulous\r\nmemory having to do with this very stock you mention. I seem to recall\r\nsomebody at some time and place consulting me about it. No, it's no\r\ngood, it won't come back. I have been much preoccupied of late, and\r\nthings slip my mind. Well, run along, Garroway, and set about rewriting\r\nthat poem of yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman's brow was dark. There was a rebellious look in his\r\nusually mild eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Rewrite it nothing! It's the goods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Garroway!\"\r\n\r\n\"I said New York was full of lepers, and so it is. Nasty, oily,\r\nlop-eared lepers that creep up to a fellow and sell him scabrous stock\r\nthat's not worth the paper it's printed on. That poem is right, and I\r\ndon't alter a word of it. No, sir!\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"One of these days, Garroway, love will awaken in your heart and you\r\nwill change your views.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of these days,\" replied the policeman frigidly, \"I shall meet that\r\nred-faced guy again, and I'll change his face. It won't be only my\r\nheart that'll be aching by the time I've finished with him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Finch's wedding-day dawned fair and bright. The sun beamed down\r\nas if George by getting married were doing it a personal favour. The\r\nbreezes, playing about him, brought with them a faint but well-defined\r\nscent of orange-blossom. And from the moment when they had finished\r\nthe practical business of getting outside their early worm, all the\r\nbirds for miles around had done nothing but stand in the trees singing\r\nMendelssohn's Wedding March. It was the sort of day to make a man throw\r\nout his chest and say \"Tra-la!\": and George did so.\r\n\r\nDelightful, he reflected, as he walked up from the inn after lunch,\r\nto think that in a few short hours he and Molly would be bowling\r\naway together in a magic train, each revolution of its wheels taking\r\nthem nearer to the Islands of the Blest and--what was almost more\r\nagreeable--farther away from Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to deny that in the past three weeks George Finch had\r\nfound his future mother-in-law something of a trial. Her consistent\r\nfailure to hide the pain which the mere sight of him so obviously\r\ncaused her was damping to an impressionable young man. George was not\r\nvain, and if Molly's stepmother had been content to look at him simply\r\nas if she thought he was something the cat had dragged out of the\r\nash-can, he could have borne up. But Mrs. Waddington went further. Her\r\nwhole attitude betrayed her belief that the cat, on inspecting George,\r\nhad been disappointed. Seeing what it had got, her manner suggested,\r\nit had given him the look of chagrin which cats give when conscious of\r\neffort wasted and had gone elsewhere to try again. A lover, counting\r\nthe days until the only girl in the world shall be his, will see\r\nsweetness and light in practically everything: but George Finch,\r\ndespite his most earnest endeavours, had been compelled to draw the\r\nline at Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\nHowever, these little annoyances were, after all, the merest trifles:\r\nand the thought, as he approached the house, that inside it there\r\nsat a suffering woman who, thinking of him, mourned and would not be\r\ncomforted, did nothing to diminish his mood of overflowing happiness.\r\nHe entered the grounds, humming lightly: and, starting to pass up the\r\ndrive, came upon Hamilton Beamish, smoking a thoughtful cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo,\" said George. \"So you've got here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Correct,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"How do you think Molly is looking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charming. But I only caught a glimpse of her as she was hurrying off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrying off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There has been a slight hitch in the proceedings. Didn't you\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\n\"My God! Tell me!\" said George, clutching his friend's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Ouch!\" said Hamilton Beamish, releasing the arm and rubbing it. \"It\r\nis nothing to get excited about. All that has happened is that the\r\nclergyman who was to have married you has met with an accident. His\r\nwife telephoned just now to say that, while standing on a chair and\r\ntrying to reach down a volume of devotional thought from an upper\r\nshelf, he fell and sprained his ankle!\"\r\n\r\n\"The poor fish!\" said George warmly. \"What does he want to go doing\r\nthat sort of thing for at a time like this? A man ought to decide once\r\nand for all at the outset of his career whether he is a clergyman or\r\nan acrobat and never deviate from his chosen path. This is awful news,\r\nHamilton. I must rush about and try to find a substitute. Good heavens!\r\nAn hour or so before the wedding, and no clergyman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, George. The necessary steps are being taken. I think\r\nMrs. Waddington would have been just as pleased to let the whole thing\r\ndrop, but Molly became very active. She telephoned in all directions,\r\nand eventually succeeded in locating a disengaged minister in the\r\nneighbourhood of Flushing. She and Mrs. Waddington have gone off\r\ntogether in the car to fetch him. They will be back in about an hour\r\nand a half.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to tell me,\" demanded George, paling, \"that I shall not see\r\nMolly for an hour and a half?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder. I quote Thomas Haynes Bayly.\r\nAnd Frederick William Thomas, a poet of the early nineteenth century,\r\namplifies this thought in the lines:\r\n\r\n    ''Tis said that absence conquers love:\r\n      But oh, believe it not:\r\n    I've tried, alas, its power to prove,\r\n      But thou art not forgot.'\r\n\r\nBe a man, George. Clench your hands and try to endure.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's sickening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be brave,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"I know just how you feel. I, also,\r\nam going through the torment of being parted from the one woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely sickening! A clergyman, and not able to stand on a chair\r\nwithout falling off!\" A sudden, gruesome thought struck him. \"Hamilton!\r\nWhat's it a sign of when the clergyman falls off a chair and sprains\r\nhis ankle on the morning of the wedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean, what is it a sign of?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, is it bad luck?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the clergyman, undoubtedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think it means that anything is going to go wrong with the\r\nwedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never heard of any such superstition. You must endeavour to\r\ncontrol these fancies, George. You are allowing yourself to get into a\r\nthoroughly overwrought condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what sort of a condition do you expect a fellow to be in on his\r\nwedding-morning, with clergymen falling off chairs wherever he looks?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton smiled tolerantly.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose nerves are inevitable on such an occasion. I notice that\r\neven Sigsbee H., who can scarcely consider himself a principal in\r\nthis affair, is thoroughly jumpy. He was walking on the lawn some\r\nlittle time ago, and when I came up behind him and laid a hand on his\r\nshoulder, he leaped like a startled roe. If Sigsbee H. Waddington\r\npossessed a mind, I would say that there was something on it. No doubt\r\nhe is brooding on the West again.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was still shining brightly, but somehow the day seemed to\r\nGeorge to have grown overcast and chill. A grey foreboding had come\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n\"I wish this hadn't happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly what the clergyman said.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't fair that a delicate, highly-strung girl like Molly should be\r\nupset like this at such a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you exaggerate the effects of the occurrence on Molly. She\r\nseemed to me to be bearing it with equanimity.\"\r\n\r\n\"She wasn't pale?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or agitated?\"\r\n\r\n\"She seemed quite her normal self.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, the last thing she said to Ferris, as the car drove away,\r\nwas....\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish had broken off. He was frowning.\r\n\r\n\"My memory is terrible. It is the effect, of course, of love. I have\r\njust remembered....\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Molly say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have forgotten. But I have just remembered what it was that I was\r\ntold to tell you as soon as you arrived. It is curious how often the\r\nmention of a name will, as it were, strike a chord. I spoke of Ferris,\r\nand it has just come back to me that Ferris gave me a message for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, darn Ferris!\"\r\n\r\n\"He asked me, when I saw you, to say that a female of some kind was\r\ncalling you up on the telephone earlier in the morning. He told her\r\nthat you were at the inn, and advised her to get you there, but she\r\nsaid it didn't matter, as she was coming down here immediately. She\r\nsaid she had known you in East Gilead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" said George, indifferently.\r\n\r\n\"And her name, if I remember rightly, was Dubbs or Tubbs or Jubbs\r\nor--no, I have it. My memory is better than I supposed. It was May\r\nStubbs. Does it convey anything to you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt chanced that as he spoke these light and casual words Hamilton\r\nBeamish, glancing down, noted that his shoe-lace had come untied.\r\nStooping to attend to this he missed seeing George's face. Nor--for he\r\nwas a man who concentrated even on the lightest task the full attention\r\nof a great mind--did he hear the other's sudden, whistling gasp of\r\nastonishment and horror. A moment later, however, he observed out of\r\nthe corner of his eye something moving: and, looking, perceived that\r\nGeorge's legs were wobbling strangely.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish straightened himself. He was now in a position to see\r\nGeorge steadily and see him whole: and the spectacle convinced him at\r\nonce that something in the message he had just delivered must have\r\ngot right in among his friend's ganglions. George Finch's agreeable\r\nfeatures seemed to be picked out in a delicate Nile-green. His eyes\r\nwere staring. His lower jaw had fallen. Nobody who had ever seen\r\na motion-picture could have had the least doubt as to what he was\r\nregistering. It was dismay.\r\n\r\n\"My dear George!\" said Hamilton Beamish, concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Wok.... Wuk.... Wok....\" George swallowed desperately. \"Wok name did\r\nyou say?\"\r\n\r\n\"May Stubbs.\" Hamilton Beamish's expression grew graver, and he looked\r\nat his friend with sudden suspicion. \"Tell me all, George. It is idle\r\nto pretend that the name is strange to you. Obviously it has awakened\r\ndeep and unpleasant memories. I trust, George, that this is not some\r\npoor girl with whose happiness you have toyed in the past, some broken\r\nblossom that you have culled and left to perish by the wayside?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Finch was staring before him in a sort of stupor.\r\n\r\n\"All is over!\" he said dully.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish softened.\r\n\r\n\"Confide in me. We are friends. I will not judge you harshly, George.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden fury melted the ice of George's torpor.\r\n\r\n\"It's all that parson's fault!\" he cried vehemently. \"I knew all along\r\nit meant bad luck. Gosh, what a Paradise this world would be if only\r\nclergymen could stand on chairs without spraining their ankles! I'm\r\ndone for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this May Stubbs?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew her in East Gilead,\" said George hopelessly. \"We were sort of\r\nengaged.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish pursed his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Apart from the slovenly English of the phrase, which is perhaps\r\nexcusable in the circumstances, I cannot see how you can have been\r\n'sort of' engaged. A man is either engaged or he is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not where I come from. In East Gilead they have what they call\r\nunderstandings.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there was an understanding between you and this Miss Stubbs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Just one of those boy and girl affairs. You know. You see a girl\r\nhome once or twice from church, and you take her to one or two picnics,\r\nand people kid you about her, and ... well, there you are. I suppose\r\nshe thought we were engaged. And now she's read in the papers about my\r\nwedding, and has come to make herself unpleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you and this girl quarrel before you separated?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We sort of drifted apart. I took it for granted that the thing was\r\nover and done with. And when I saw Molly....\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish laid a hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\"George,\" he said, \"I want you to give me your full attention: for\r\nwe have arrived now at the very core of the matter. Were there any\r\nletters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dozens. And of course she has kept them. She used to sleep with them\r\nunder her pillow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad!\" said Hamilton Beamish, shaking his head. \"Very bad!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I remember her saying once that she believed in breach of promise\r\nsuits.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish frowned. He seemed to be deploring the get-rich-quick\r\nspirit of the modern girl, who is not content to sit down and wait for\r\nher alimony.\r\n\r\n\"You think it certain that she is coming here with the intention of\r\nmaking trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"What other reason could she have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I fancy you are right. I must think. I must think. Let me think.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, so saying, Hamilton Beamish turned sharply to the left and began\r\nto walk slowly round in a circle, his hands behind his back and his\r\nface bent and thoughtful. His eyes searched the ground as if to wrest\r\ninspiration from it.\r\n\r\nFew sights in this world are more inspiring than that of a great\r\nthinker actually engaged in thought: and yet George Finch, watching his\r\nfriend, chafed. He had a perhaps forgivable craving for quick results:\r\nand Hamilton Beamish, though impressive, did not seem to be getting\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Have you thought of anything?\" he asked, as the other came round for\r\nthe third time.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish held up a hand in silent reproof, and resumed his\r\npacing. Presently he stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to this engagement....\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't an engagement. It was an understanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"With regard to this understanding or engagement, the weak spot in your\r\nline of defence is undoubtedly the fact that it was you who broke it\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't break it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I used the wrong expression. I should have said that it was you\r\nwho took the initiative. You left East Gilead and came to New York.\r\nTherefore, technically, you deserted this girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't say things like that. Can't you understand that\r\nit was just one of those boy and girl affairs which come to an end of\r\nthemselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was looking at the thing from a lawyer's view-point. And may I point\r\nout that the affair appears not to have come to an end. What I am\r\ntrying to make clear is this: that, if you had wished it to come to\r\nan end, you should, before you left East Gilead, have arranged somehow\r\nthat this Miss Stubbs broke off the engagement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Understanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"The engagement or understanding. That would have cleaned the slate.\r\nYou should have done something that would have made her disgusted with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I? I'm not the sort of fellow who can do things like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even now, it seems to me, if you could do something that would revolt\r\nthis Miss Stubbs ... make her recoil from you with loathing....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must think,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\nHe did four more laps.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you had committed some sort of crime?\" he said, returning to\r\nthe fixed point. \"Suppose she were to find out you were a thief? She\r\nwouldn't want to marry you if you were on your way to Sing-Sing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. And neither would Molly.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. I must think again.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some moments later that George, eyeing his friend with the\r\ngrowing dislike which those of superior brain-power engender in us when\r\nthey fail to deliver the goods in our times of crisis, observed him\r\ngive a sudden start.\r\n\r\n\"I think I have it,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"This Miss Stubbs. Tell me, is she strait-laced? Prudish? Most of those\r\nvillage girls are.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge reflected.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember ever having noticed. I never did anything to make her\r\nprudish about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we may assume that, having lived all her life in a spot\r\nlike East Gilead, she is. The solution of this difficulty, then, is\r\nobviously to lead her to suppose that you have become a reprobate.\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\"\r\n\r\n\"A Don Juan. A Lothario. A libertine. It should be perfectly easy. She\r\nhas seen motion-pictures of life in New York, and will not be hard to\r\nconvince that you have deteriorated since you came to live there. Our\r\nplan of action now becomes straightforward and simple. All we have to\r\ndo is to get some girl to come along and say that you have no right to\r\nmarry anybody but her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see the scene now. This Miss Stubbs is sitting beside you, a\r\ndowdy figure in her home-made village gown. You are talking of the\r\nold days. You are stroking her hand. Suddenly you look up and start.\r\nThe door has opened and a girl, all in black with a white face, is\r\nentering. Her eyes are haggard, her hair disordered. In her arms she\r\nclasps a little bundle.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Not that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, we will dispense with the bundle. She stretches out her\r\narms to you. She totters. You rush to support her. The scene is similar\r\nto one in Haddon Chambers' 'Passers-By.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"What could happen? The fiancée saw the ruined girl had the greater\r\nclaim, so she joined their hands together and crept silently from the\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge laughed mirthlessly.\r\n\r\n\"There's just one thing you're overlooking. Where are we going to get\r\nthe white-faced girl?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish stroked his chin.\r\n\r\n\"There is that difficulty. I must think.\"\r\n\r\n\"And while you're thinking,\" said George coldly, \"I'll do the only\r\npractical thing there is to be done, and go down to the station and\r\nmeet her, and have a talk with her and try to get her to be sensible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that would be as well. But I still feel that my scheme would\r\nbe the ideal one, if only we could find the girl. It is too bad that\r\nyou have not a dark past.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dark past,\" said George bitterly, \"is all ahead of me.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and hurried down the drive. Hamilton Beamish, still\r\nmeditating, made his way towards the house.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the lawn, when, as he stopped to light a cigarette to\r\nassist thought, he saw a sight that made him drop the match and draw\r\nback into the shelter of a tree.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish stopped, looked and listened. A girl had emerged\r\nfrom a clump of rhododendrons, and was stealing softly round the lawn\r\ntowards the dining-room window.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGirlhood is the season of dreams. To Fanny Welch, musing over the\r\nposition of affairs after Sigsbee H. Waddington had given her her final\r\ninstructions, there had come a quaint, fantastic thought, creeping\r\ninto her mind like a bee into a flower--the thought that if she got to\r\nthe house an hour earlier than the time he had mentioned, it might be\r\npossible for her to steal the necklace and keep it for herself.\r\n\r\nThe flaw in the scheme, as originally outlined, had seemed to her all\r\nalong to lie in the fact that Mr. Waddington was to preside over the\r\nenterprise and take the loot from her the moment she had got it. The\r\nrevised plan appeared immeasurably more attractive, and she proceeded\r\nto put it into action.\r\n\r\nLuck seemed to be with her. Nobody was about, the window was ajar, and\r\nthere on the table lay that which she had now come to look on in the\r\nlight of a present for a good girl. She crept out of her hiding-place,\r\nstole round the edge of the lawn, entered the room, and had just\r\ngrasped the case in her hand, when it was borne sharply in upon her\r\nthat luck was not with her so much as she had supposed. A heavy hand\r\nwas placed upon her shoulder: and, twisting round, she perceived a\r\nmajestic-looking man with a square chin and horn-rimmed spectacles.\r\n\r\n\"Well, young lady!\" said this person.\r\n\r\nFanny breathed hard. These little contretemps are the risk of the\r\nprofession, but that makes them none the easier to bear philosophically.\r\n\r\n\"Put down that jewel-case.\"\r\n\r\nFanny did so. There was a pause. Hamilton Beamish moved to the window,\r\nblocking it up.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Fanny.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish adjusted his spectacles.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got me. What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you expect me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn me over to the police?\"\r\n\r\nThe figure in the window nodded curtly. Fanny clasped her hands\r\ntogether. Her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Don't turn me over to the bulls, mister! I only did it for ma's\r\nsake....\"\r\n\r\n\"All wrong!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you was out of work and starvin' and you had to sit and watch your\r\npoor old ma bendin' over the wash-tub....\"\r\n\r\n\"All wrong!\" repeated Hamilton Beamish forcefully.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, all wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mere crude Broadway melodrama. That stuff might deceive some people,\r\nbut not me.\"\r\n\r\nFanny shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought it was worth trying,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish was regarding her keenly. That busy brain was never\r\nstill, and now it had begun to work with even more than its normal\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n\"Are you an actress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? I should say not. My folks are awful particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you have considerable dramatic ability. There was a ring of\r\nsincerity in that drivel you just recited which would have convinced\r\nmost men. I think I could use you in a little drama which I have been\r\nplanning. I'll make a bargain with you. I have no wish to send you to\r\nprison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it's a lot better fun doing things that you oughtn't, isn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the point is, I have a friend who is in a difficulty, and it\r\noccurs to me that you can get him out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Always glad to oblige.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend is going to be married to-day, and he has just heard\r\nthat a previous fiancée of his, whom in the excitement inseparable\r\nfrom falling in love with the girl who is to be his bride he had\r\nunfortunately overlooked, is on her way here.\"\r\n\r\n\"To make trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what can I do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just this. For five minutes I want you to play the rôle of my friend's\r\ndiscarded victim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will put it more plainly. In a short while this girl will arrive,\r\nprobably in company with my friend, who has gone to meet her at the\r\nstation. You will be waiting outside here. At an appropriate moment\r\nyou will rush into the room, hold out your arms to my friend and cry\r\n'George! George! Why did you desert me? You don't belong to that girl\r\nthere. You belong to me--the woman you have wronged!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\nFanny drew herself up haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life!\" she said. \"Suppose my husband got to hear of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you married?\"\r\n\r\n\"Married this morning at the Little Church Round the Corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you come here and try to steal things on your wedding-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? You know as well as I do what it costs nowadays to set up\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it would be a severe shock to your husband to find that you\r\nhad been sent to prison! I think you had better be reasonable.\"\r\n\r\nFanny scraped the floor with her shoe.\r\n\r\n\"Would this thing you want me to do get into the papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"And there's another thing. Suppose I did come in and pull that spiel,\r\nwho would believe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl would. She is very simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just an ignorant village girl. The sort who would naturally recoil\r\nfrom a man in the circumstances I have outlined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they ask me questions?\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose they do? Suppose the girl says Where did you meet him and\r\nwhen did all this happen and what the hell and all like that, what do I\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish considered the point.\r\n\r\n\"I think the best plan would be for you to pretend, immediately after\r\nyou have spoken the words I have indicated, that emotion has made you\r\nfeel faint. Yes, that is best. Having said those words, exclaim 'Air!\r\nAir! I want air!' and rush out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you're talking. I like that bit about rushing out. I'll go so\r\nquick, they won't see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are prepared to do this thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks as if I'd got to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Kindly run through your opening speech. I must see that you are\r\nletter-perfect.\"\r\n\r\n\"George! George!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Pause before the second George and take in breath. Remember that the\r\nintensity or loudness of the voice depends on the amplitude of the\r\nmovement of the vocal chords, which pitch depends on the number of\r\nvibrations per second. Tone is strengthened by the resonance of the air\r\non the air-passages and in the pharyngeal and oral cavities. Once more,\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\n\"George! George! Why did you desert me?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Arms extended.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't belong to that girl there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pause. Breath.\"\r\n\r\n\"You belong to me--the woman you have wronged!\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish nodded with restrained approval.\r\n\r\n\"Not bad. Not at all bad. I should have liked, if it had been\r\npossible, to have an expert examine your thyro-arytenoid ligaments:\r\nand I wish there had been time for you to study my booklet on \"Voice\r\nProduction.\" ... However, I think it will do. Now go back and hide in\r\nthe rhododendrons. This girl may be arriving at any moment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish strolled out into the hall. Something attempted,\r\nsomething done, had earned a cigarette. He was just lighting one, when\r\nthere was a grinding of wheels on the gravel, and through the open door\r\nhe saw Madame Eulalie alighting from a red two-seater car. He skipped\r\njoyously to meet her.\r\n\r\n\"So you managed to come after all!\"\r\n\r\nMadame Eulalie shook his hand with that brisk amiability which was one\r\nof her main charms.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But I've got to turn right round and go back again. I've three\r\nappointments this afternoon. I suppose you're staying on for the\r\nwedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had intended to. I promised George I would be his best man.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a pity. I could have driven you back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can easily cancel the thing,\" said Hamilton Beamish quickly.\r\n\"In fact, I will, directly George returns. He can get dozens of best\r\nmen--dozens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Returns? Where has he gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the station.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a nuisance. I came especially to see him. Still, it doesn't\r\nmatter. I had better see Miss Waddington for a moment, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is out.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Eulalie raised her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't anybody stay in the house in these parts when there's going to\r\nbe a wedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"There has been a slight accident,\" explained Hamilton Beamish. \"The\r\nclergyman sprained his ankle, and Mrs. Waddington and Molly had gone\r\nto Flushing to pick up an understudy. And George has gone to the\r\nstation....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, why has George gone to the station?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish hesitated. Then, revolted by the thought that he\r\nshould be hiding anything from this girl, he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Can you keep a secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I've never tried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is something quite between ourselves. Poor George is in\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any worse trouble than most bridegrooms?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would not speak like that,\" said Hamilton Beamish, pained.\r\n\"You seem to mock at Love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've nothing against Love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love is the only thing worth while in the world. In peace, Love tunes\r\nthe shepherd's reed, in war he mounts the warrior's steed....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, doesn't he. You were going to tell me what George is in trouble\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the fact is, on the eve of his wedding an old acquaintance of\r\nhis has suddenly appeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Female?\"\r\n\r\n\"Female.\"\r\n\r\n\"I begin to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"George wrote her letters. She still has them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse and worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if she makes trouble it will stop the wedding. Mrs. Waddington is\r\nonly waiting for an excuse to forbid it. Already, she has stated in so\r\nmany words that she is suspicious of George's morals.\"\r\n\r\n\"How absurd! George is like the driven snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. A thoroughly fine-minded man. Why, I remember him once\r\nleaving the table at a bachelor dinner because some one told an\r\nimproper story.\"\r\n\r\n\"How splendid of him! What was the story?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember. Still, Mrs. Waddington has this opinion of him, so\r\nthere it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this sounds very interesting. What are you going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, George has gone to the station to try to intercept this Miss\r\nStubbs and reason with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Stubbs?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is her name. By the way, she comes from your home town, East\r\nGilead. Perhaps you know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I seem to recollect the name. So George has gone to reason with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But, of course, she will insist on coming here.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's bad.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite so bad as you think,\" he said. \"You see, I have been giving\r\nthe matter some little thought, and I may say I have the situation well\r\nin hand. I have arranged everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be terribly clever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well!\" said Hamilton Beamish modestly.\r\n\r\n\"But, of course, I knew you were, the moment I read your Booklets. Have\r\nyou a cigarette?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Eulalie selected a cigarette from his case and lit it. Hamilton\r\nBeamish, taking the match from her fingers, blew it out and placed it\r\nreverently in his left top waistcoat-pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Madame Eulalie.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Hamilton Beamish, coming out of his thoughts. \"We were\r\nspeaking about George. It appears that George, before he left East\r\nGilead, had what he calls an understanding, but which seems to me to\r\nhave differed in no respect from a definite engagement, with a girl\r\nnamed May Stubbs. Unpleasant name!\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible. Just the sort of name I would want to change.\"\r\n\r\n\"He then came into money, left for New York, and forgot all about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she didn't forget all about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently not. I picture her as a poor, dowdy little thing--you know\r\nwhat these village girls are--without any likelihood of getting another\r\nhusband. So she has clung to her one chance. I suppose she thinks that\r\nby coming here at this time she will force George to marry her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are going to be too clever to let anything like that happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you wonderful!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is extremely kind of you to say so,\" said Hamilton Beamish, pulling\r\ndown his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\"What have you arranged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the whole difficulty is that at present George is in the\r\nposition of having broken the engagement. So, when this May Stubbs\r\narrives, I am going to get her to throw him over of her own free-will.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you propose to do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite simply. You see, we may take it for granted that she is a prude.\r\nI have, therefore, constructed a little drama, by means of which George\r\nwill appear an abandoned libertine.\"\r\n\r\n\"George!\"\r\n\r\n\"She will be shocked and revolted and will at once break off all\r\nrelations with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. Did you think all this out by yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely by myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're too clever for one man. You ought to incorporate.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Hamilton Beamish that the moment had arrived to speak out\r\nfrankly and without subterfuge, to reveal in the neatest phrases at\r\nhis disposal the love which had been swelling in his heart like some\r\nyeasty ferment ever since he had first taken a speck of dust out of\r\nthis girl's eye on the door-step of Number Sixteen, East Seventy-Ninth\r\nStreet. And he was about to begin doing so, when she looked past him\r\nand uttered a pleased laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Georgie Finch!\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish turned, justly exasperated. Every time he endeavoured\r\nto speak his love, it seemed that something had to happen to prevent\r\nhim. Yesterday it had been the loathsome Charley on the telephone, and\r\nnow it was George Finch. George was standing in the doorway, flushed as\r\nif he had been walking quickly. He was staring at the girl in a manner\r\nwhich Hamilton Beamish resented. To express his resentment he coughed\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\nGeorge paid no attention. He continued to stare.\r\n\r\n\"And how is Georgie? You have interrupted a most interesting story,\r\nGeorge.\"\r\n\r\n\"May!\" George Finch placed a finger inside his collar, as if trying to\r\nloosen it. \"May! I--I've just been down to the station to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came by car.\"\r\n\r\n\"May?\" exclaimed Hamilton Beamish, a horrid light breaking upon him.\r\n\r\nMadame Eulalie turned to him brightly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm the dowdy little thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're not a dowdy little thing,\" said Hamilton Beamish, finding\r\nthought difficult but concentrating on the one uncontrovertible fact.\r\n\r\n\"I was when George knew me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your name is Madame Eulalie.\"\r\n\r\n\"My professional name. Didn't we agree that anyone who had a name like\r\nMay Stubbs would want to change it as quickly as possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are really May Stubbs?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish bit his lip. He regarded his friend coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you, George. You are engaged to two of the prettiest\r\ngirls I have ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"How very charming of you, Jimmy!\" said Madame Eulalie.\r\n\r\nGeorge Finch's face worked convulsively.\r\n\r\n\"But, May, honestly.... Have a heart!... You don't really look on me as\r\nengaged to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"But ... but ... I thought you had forgotten all about me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, after all those beautiful letters you wrote!\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy and girl affair,\" babbled George.\r\n\r\n\"Was it, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, May!...\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish had been listening to these exchanges with a rapidly\r\nrising temperature. His heart was pounding feverishly in his bosom.\r\nThere is no one who becomes so primitive, when gripped by love, as the\r\nman who all his life has dwelt in the cool empyrean of the intellect.\r\nFor twenty years and more, Hamilton Beamish had supposed that he was\r\nabove the crude passions of the ordinary man, and when love had got\r\nhim it got him good. And now, standing there and listening to these\r\ntwo, he was conscious of a jealousy so keen that he could no longer\r\nkeep silent. Hamilton Beamish, the thinker, had ceased to be: and there\r\nstood in his place Hamilton Beamish, the descendant of ancestors who\r\nhad conducted their love affairs with stout clubs and who, on seeing a\r\nrival, wasted no time in calm reflection but jumped on him like a ton\r\nof bricks and did their best to bite his head off. If you had given\r\nhim a bearskin and taken away his spectacles, Hamilton Beamish at this\r\nmoment would have been Prehistoric Man.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"But, May, you know you don't love me....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" said Hamilton Beamish again in a nasty, snarling voice. And\r\nsilence fell.\r\n\r\nThe cave-man adjusted his spectacles, and glared at his erstwhile\r\nfriend with venomous dislike. His fingers twitched, as if searching for\r\na club.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, you,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"and get me right! See?\r\nThat'll be about all from you about this girl loving you, unless you\r\nwant me to step across and bust you on the beezer. I love her, see? And\r\nshe's going to marry me, see? And nobody else, see? And anyone who says\r\ndifferent had better notify his friends where he wants his body sent,\r\nsee? Love you, indeed? A swell chance! I'm the little guy she's going\r\nto marry, see? Me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, folding his arms, the thinker paused for a reply.\r\n\r\nIt did not come immediately. George Finch, unused to primitive emotions\r\nfrom this particular quarter, remained completely dumb. It was left for\r\nMadame Eulalie to supply comment.\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy!\" she said faintly.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish caught her masterfully about the waist. He kissed her\r\neleven times.\r\n\r\n\"So that's that!\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Jimmy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll get married to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Jimmy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are my mate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Jimmy.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\nGeorge came to life like a clockwork toy.\r\n\r\n\"Hamilton, I congratulate you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, thanks.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beamish spoke a little dazedly. He blinked. Already the ferment\r\nhad begun to subside, and Beamish the cave-man was fast giving place\r\nto Beamish of the Booklets. He was dimly conscious of having expressed\r\nhimself a little too warmly and in language which in a calmer moment he\r\nwould never have selected. Then he caught the girl's eyes, fixed on him\r\nadoringly, and he had no regrets.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said again.\r\n\r\n\"May is a splendid girl,\" said George. \"You will be very happy. I speak\r\nas one who knows her. How sympathetic you always were in the old days,\r\nMay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was I?\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly were. Don't you remember how I used to bring my troubles\r\nto you, and we would sit together on the sofa in front of your parlour\r\nfire?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were always afraid some one was listening at the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they had been, the only thing they'd have found out would have been\r\nthe lamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" said Hamilton Beamish abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Those were happy days,\" said Madame Eulalie.\r\n\r\n\"And do you remember how your little brother used to call me April\r\nShowers?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, did he?\" said Mr. Beamish, snorting a little. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I brought May flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's quite enough,\" said Hamilton Beamish, not without reason. \"I\r\nshould like to remind you, Finch, that this lady is engaged to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Endeavour not to forget it,\" said Hamilton Beamish curtly. \"And,\r\nlater on, should you ever come to share a meal at our little home, be\r\nsparing of your reminiscences of the dear old days. You get--you take\r\nmy meaning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will be getting along. May has to return to New York\r\nimmediately, and I am going with her. You must look elsewhere for a\r\nbest man at your wedding. You are very lucky to be having a wedding at\r\nall. Good-bye, George. Come, darling.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two-seater was moving down the drive, when Hamilton Beamish clapped\r\na hand to his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"I had quite forgotten,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"What have you forgotten, Jimmy dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just something I wanted to say to George, sweetheart. Wait here for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"George,\" said Hamilton Beamish, returning to the hall. \"I have just\r\nremembered something. Ring for Ferris and tell him to stay in the room\r\nwith the wedding-presents and not leave it for a moment. They aren't\r\nsafe, lying loose like that. You should have had a detective.\"\r\n\r\n\"We intended to, but Mr. Waddington insisted on it so strongly that\r\nMrs. Waddington said the idea was absurd. I'll go and tell Ferris\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\nHe passed out on to the lawn: and reaching the rhododendron bushes,\r\nwhistled softly.\r\n\r\n\"Now what?\" said Fanny, pushing out an inquiring head.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here I am. When does the show start?\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"Events have occurred which render\r\nour little ruse unnecessary. So you can return to your home and husband\r\nas soon as you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" said Fanny.\r\n\r\nShe plucked a rhododendron leaf and crushed it reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know as I'm in any hurry,\" she said. \"I kind of like it out\r\nhere. The air and the sun and the birds and everything. I guess I'll\r\nstick around for awhile.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish regarded her with a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, if you wish it,\" he said. \"I should mention, however, that\r\nif you were contemplating another attempt at those jewels, you would do\r\nwell to abandon the idea. From now on a large butler will be stationed\r\nin the room, watching over it, and there might be unpleasantness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" said Fanny meditatively.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think of everything, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for the compliment,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge did not delay. Always sound, Hamilton Beamish's advice appeared\r\nto him now even sounder than usual. He rang the bell for Ferris.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Ferris,\" said George, \"Mr. Beamish thinks you had better stay in\r\nthe room with the wedding-presents and keep an eye on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"In case somebody tries to steal them, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so, sir.\"\r\n\r\nRelief, as it always does, had given George a craving for conversation.\r\nHe wanted to buttonhole some fellow-creature and babble. He would have\r\npreferred this fellow-creature to have been anyone but Ferris, for he\r\nhad not forgotten the early passages of their acquaintanceship and\r\nseemed still to sense in the butler's manner a lingering antipathy. But\r\nFerris was there, so he babbled to him.\r\n\r\n\"Nice day, Ferris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice country round here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was somewhat taken aback.\r\n\r\n\"Did you say, No, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Yes, sir? I thought you said No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you don't like the country round here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I disapprove of it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the sort of country to which I have been accustomed, sir. It\r\nis not like the country round Little-Seeping-in-the-Wold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"In England, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the English country's nice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it gives uniform satisfaction, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge felt damped. In his mood of relief he had hoped that Ferris\r\nmight have brought himself to sink the butler in the friend.\r\n\r\n\"What don't you like about the country round here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I disapprove of the mosquitoes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there are only a few.\"\r\n\r\n\"I disapprove of even one mosquito, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge tried again.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose everybody downstairs is very excited about the wedding,\r\nFerris?\"\r\n\r\n\"By 'everybody downstairs' you allude to...?\"\r\n\r\n\"The--er--the domestic staff.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not canvassed their opinions, sir. I mix very little with my\r\ncolleagues.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you disapprove of them?\" said George, nettled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nThe butler raised his eyebrows. He preferred the lower middle classes\r\nnot to be inquisitive. However, he stooped to explain.\r\n\r\n\"Many of them are Swedes, sir, and the rest are Irish.\"\r\n\r\n\"You disapprove of Swedes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Their heads are too square, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you disapprove of the Irish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they are Irish, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge shifted his feet uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you don't disapprove of weddings, Ferris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem to me melancholy occasions, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you married, Ferris?\"\r\n\r\n\"A widower, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, weren't you happy when you got married?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was Mrs. Ferris?\"\r\n\r\n\"She appeared to take a certain girlish pleasure in the ceremony, sir,\r\nbut it soon blew over.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you account for that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not say, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry weddings depress you, Ferris. Surely when two people love\r\neach other and mean to go on loving each other....\"\r\n\r\n\"Marriage is not a process for prolonging the life of love. It merely\r\nmummifies its corpse.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Ferris, if there were no marriages, what would become of\r\nposterity?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no necessity for posterity, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You disapprove of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge walked pensively out on to the drive in front of the house. He\r\nwas conscious of a diminution of the exuberant happiness which had led\r\nhim to engage the butler in conversation. He saw clearly now that,\r\nFerris's conversation being what it was, a bridegroom who engaged him\r\nin it on his wedding-day was making a blunder. A suitable, even an\r\nideal, companion for a funeral, Ferris seemed out of harmony when the\r\njoy-bells were ringing.\r\n\r\nHe looked out upon the pleasant garden with sobered gaze: and, looking,\r\nwas aware of Sigsbee H. Waddington approaching. Sigsbee's manner was\r\nagitated. He conveyed the impression of having heard bad news or of\r\nhaving made a discovery which disconcerted him.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen!\" said Sigsbee H. \"What's that infernal butler doing in\r\nthe room with the wedding-presents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keeping guard over them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told him to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell's bells!\" said Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\nHe gave George a peculiar look and shimmered off. If George had\r\nbeen more in the frame of mind to analyse the looks of his future\r\nfather-in-law, he might have seen in this one a sort of shuddering\r\nloathing. But he was not in the frame of mind. Besides, Sigsbee H.\r\nWaddington was not the kind of man whose looks one analysed. He was one\r\nof those negligible men whom one pushes out of sight and forgets about.\r\nGeorge proceeded to forget about him almost immediately. He was still\r\nforgetting about him, when an automobile appeared round the bend of the\r\ndrive and, stopping beside him, discharged Mrs. Waddington, Molly, and\r\na man with a face like a horse whom, from his clerical costume, George\r\ntook correctly to be the deputy from Flushing.\r\n\r\n\"Molly!\" cried George.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are, angel,\" said Molly.\r\n\r\n\"And mother!\" said George, with less heartiness.\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\" said Mrs. Waddington, with still less heartiness than George.\r\n\r\n\"This is the Reverend Gideon Voules,\" said Molly. \"He is going to marry\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Mrs. Waddington, turning to the clergyman and speaking in\r\na voice which seemed to George's sensitive ear to contain too strong a\r\nnote of apology, \"is the bridegroom.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Gideon Voules looked at George with a dull and\r\npoached-egg-like eye. He did not seem to the latter to be a frightfully\r\ncheery sort of person: but, after all, when you're married, you're\r\nmarried, no matter how like a poached egg the presiding minister may\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do?\" said the Rev. Gideon.\r\n\r\n\"I'm fine,\" said George. \"How are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in robust health, I thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid! Nothing wrong with the ankles, eh?\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Gideon glanced down at them and seemed satisfied with this\r\nsection of his lower limbs, even though they were draped in white socks.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"So many clergymen nowadays,\" explained George, \"are falling off chairs\r\nand spraining them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never fall off chairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you're just the fellow I've been scouring the country for,\" said\r\nGeorge. \"If all clergymen were like you....\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington came to life.\r\n\r\n\"Would you care for a glass of milk?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, mother,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"I was not addressing you,\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"I was speaking to\r\nMr. Voules. He has had a long drive and no doubt requires refreshment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" said George. \"What am I thinking about? Yes,\r\nyou must certainly stoke up and preserve your strength. We don't want\r\nyou fainting half-way through the ceremony.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would have every excuse,\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\nShe led the way into the dining-room, where light refreshments were\r\nlaid out on a side-table--a side-table brightly decorated by the\r\npresence of Sigsbee H. Waddington, who was sipping a small gin and\r\ntonic and watching with lowering gaze the massive imperturbability\r\nof Ferris, the butler. Ferris, though he obviously disapproved of\r\nwedding-presents, was keeping a loyal eye on them.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here, Ferris?\" asked Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\nThe butler raised the loyal eye.\r\n\r\n\"Guarding the gifts, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch, madam.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington shot a look of disgust at George.\r\n\r\n\"There is no necessity whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only an imbecile would have suggested such a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, madam.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler retired. Sigsbee Horatio, watching him go, sighed unhappily.\r\nWhat was the good of him going now? felt Sigsbee. From now on the room\r\nwould be full. Already automobiles were beginning to arrive, and a\r\nswarm of wedding-guests had begun to settle upon the refreshments on\r\nthe side-table.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Gideon Voules, thoughtfully lowering a milk and ham-sandwich\r\ninto the abyss, had drawn George into a corner and was endeavouring to\r\nmake his better acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"I always like to have a little chat with the bridegroom before the\r\nceremony,\" he said. \"It is agreeable to be able to feel that he is, in\r\na sense, a personal friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very nice of you,\" said George, touched.\r\n\r\n\"I married a young fellow in Flushing named Miglett the other\r\nday--Claude R. Miglett. Perhaps you recall the name?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I thought you might have seen it in the papers. They were full\r\nof the affair. I always feel that, if I had not made a point of\r\nestablishing personal relations with him before the ceremony, I should\r\nnot have been in a position to comfort him as I did after the accident\r\noccurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accident?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The bride was most unfortunately killed by a motor-lorry as they\r\nwere leaving the church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have always thought it singularly unfortunate. But then it almost\r\nseems as if there were some fatality about the weddings at which I\r\nofficiate. Only a week before, I had married a charming young couple,\r\nand both were dead before the month was out. A girder fell on them as\r\nthey were passing a building which was under construction. In the case\r\nof another pair whom I married earlier in the year, the bridegroom\r\ncontracted some form of low fever. A very fine young fellow. He came\r\nout in pink spots. We were all most distressed about it.\" He turned to\r\nMrs. Waddington, whom an inrush of guests had driven into the corner.\r\n\"I was telling our young friend here of a rather singular coincidence.\r\nIn each of the last two weddings at which I officiated the bridegroom\r\ndied within a few days of the ceremony.\"\r\n\r\nA wistful look came into Mrs. Waddington's face. She seemed to be\r\nfeeling that luck like that could not hold.\r\n\r\n\"I, personally,\" she said, \"have had a presentiment right from the\r\nbeginning that this marriage would never take place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, that is very curious,\" said the Rev. Gideon. \"I am a strong\r\nbeliever in presentiments.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they are sent to warn us--to help us to prepare ourselves for\r\ndisaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the present instance,\" said Mrs. Waddington, \"the word disaster is\r\nnot the one I would have selected.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge tottered away. Once more there was creeping over him that grey\r\nforeboding which had come to him earlier in the day. So reduced was\r\nhis nervous system that he actually sought comfort in the society of\r\nSigsbee Horatio. After all, he thought, whatever Sigsbee's shortcomings\r\nas a man, he at least was a friend. A philosopher with the future of\r\nthe race at heart might sigh as he looked upon Sigsbee H. Waddington,\r\nbut in a bleak world George could not pick and choose his chums.\r\n\r\nA moment later there was forced upon him the unpleasing discovery that\r\nin supposing that Mr. Waddington liked him he had been altogether too\r\noptimistic. The look which his future father-in-law bestowed upon him\r\nas he sidled up was not one of affection. It was the sort of look\r\nwhich, had he been sheriff of Gory Gulch, Arizona, the elder man might\r\nhave bestowed upon a horse-thief.\r\n\r\n\"Darned officious!\" rumbled Sigsbee H., in a querulous undertone.\r\n\"Officious and meddling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Telling that butler to come in here and watch the presents.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, good heavens, don't you realise that, if I hadn't told him, some\r\none might have sneaked in and stolen something?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington's expression was now that of a cow-boy who, leaping into\r\nbed, discovers too late that a frolicsome friend has placed a cactus\r\nbetween the sheets: and George, at the lowest ebb, was about to pass\r\non to the refreshment-table and see if a little potato-salad might not\r\nact as a restorative, when there stepped from the crowd gathered round\r\nthe food a large and ornately dressed person chewing the remains of a\r\nslab of caviare on toast. George had a dim recollection of having seen\r\nhim among the guests at that first dinner-party at Number 16, East\r\nSeventy-Ninth Street. His memory had not erred. The new-comer was no\r\nless a man than United Beef.\r\n\r\n\"Hello there, Waddington,\" said United Beef.\r\n\r\n\"Ur,\" said Sigsbee Horatio. He did not like the other, who had once\r\nrefused to lend him money and--what was more--had gone to the mean\r\nlength of quoting Shakespeare to support his refusal.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Waddington,\" proceeded United Beef, \"don't I seem to remember you\r\ncoming to me sometime ago and asking about that motion-picture company,\r\nthe Finer and Better? You were thinking of putting some money in, if I\r\nrecollect?\"\r\n\r\nAn expression of acute alarm shot into Mr. Waddington's face. He gulped\r\npainfully.\r\n\r\n\"Not me,\" he said hastily. \"Not me. Get it out of your nut that it was\r\nI who wanted to buy the stuff. I just thought that if the stock was any\r\ngood my dear wife might be interested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not at all the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you happen to know if your wife bought any?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she didn't. I heard later that the company was no good, so I did\r\nnot mention it to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad,\" said United Beef. \"Too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, too bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a rather remarkable thing has happened. Quite a romance in its\r\nway. As a motion-picture company the thing was, as you say, no good.\r\nCouldn't seem to do anything right. But yesterday, when a workman\r\nstarted to dig a hole on the lot to put up a 'For Sale' sign, I'm\r\ndarned if he didn't strike oil.\"\r\n\r\nThe solid outlines of United Beef shimmered uncertainly before Mr.\r\nWaddington's horrified eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oil?\" he gurgled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Oil. What looks like turning out the biggest gusher in the\r\nsouth-west.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but--do you mean to say, then, that the shares are--are really\r\nworth something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only millions, that's all. Merely millions. It's a pity you didn't buy\r\nsome. This caviare,\" said United Beef, champing meditatively, \"is good.\r\nThat's what it is, Waddington--good. I think I'll have another slice.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to arrest the progress of a millionaire who is starting\r\noff in the direction of caviare, but Mr. Waddington, with a frenzied\r\nclutch at the other's coat-sleeve, succeeded in doing so for a brief\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\"When did you hear this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as I was starting out this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think anybody else knows about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody down-town, I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, listen,\" said Mr. Waddington urgently. \"Say, listen!\" He clung\r\nto the caviare-maddened man's sleeve with a desperate grip. \"What I am\r\ngetting at is, I know a guy--nothing to do with business--who has a\r\nblock of that stock. Do you think there's any chance of him not having\r\nheard about this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite likely. But, if you're thinking of getting it off him, you'd\r\nbetter hurry. The story is probably in the evening papers by now.\"\r\n\r\nThe words acted on Sigsbee H. Waddington like an electric shock. He\r\nreleased the other's sleeve, and United Beef shot off towards the\r\nrefreshment-table like a homing pigeon. Mr. Waddington felt in his\r\nhip-pocket to make sure that he still possessed the three hundred\r\ndollars which he had hoped that day to hand over to Fanny Welch, and\r\nbounded out of the room, out of the house, and out of the front gate;\r\nand, after bounding along the broad highway to the station, leaped\r\ninto a train which might have been meeting him there by appointment.\r\nNever in his life before had Sigsbee H. Waddington caught a train so\r\nexpeditiously: and the fact seemed to him a happy omen. He looked\r\nforward with a cheery confidence to the interview with that policeman\r\nfellow to whom he had--in a moment of mistaken generosity--parted\r\nwith his precious stock. The policeman had seemed a simple sort of\r\nsoul, just the sort of man with whom it is so nice to do business. Mr.\r\nWaddington began to rehearse the opening speeches of the interview.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen,\" he would say. \"Say, listen, my dear....\"\r\n\r\nHe sat up in his seat with a jerk. He had completely forgotten the\r\npoliceman's name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later, when the stars had begun to peep out and the birds\r\nwere rustling sleepily in the trees, a solitary figure might have been\r\nobserved moving slowly up the drive towards the front door of the\r\nWaddington summer-residence at Hempstead, Long Island. It was Sigsbee\r\nH., returning from his travels.\r\n\r\nHe walked apprehensively, like a cat that expects a half-brick. Oh,\r\nsings the poet, to be home again, home again, home again: but Sigsbee\r\nH. Waddington could not bring himself to share that sunny view-point.\r\nWith the opportunity for quiet reflection there had come to him the\r\nnumbing realisation that beneath the roof before him trouble waited. On\r\nother occasions while serving his second sentence as a married man he\r\nhad done things of which his wife had disapproved--and of which she had\r\nexpressed her disapproval in a manner that was frank and unrestrained:\r\nbut never before had he committed such a domestic crime as the one\r\nbeneath the burden of which he was staggering now. He had actually\r\nabsented himself from the wedding of his only child after having been\r\nspecifically instructed to give her away at the altar: and if on a\r\ntheme like this his wife did not extend herself in a fashion calculated\r\nto stagger Humanity--well, all Sigsbee H. could say was that past form\r\nmeant nothing and could be ruled out as a guide completely.\r\n\r\nHe sighed drearily. He felt depressed and battered, in no mood to\r\nlisten to home-truths about himself. All he wanted was to be alone on a\r\nsofa with his shoes off and something to drink at his elbow. For he had\r\nhad a trying time in the great city.\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington, as has perhaps been sufficiently indicated in\r\nthis narrative, was not a man who could think deeply without getting\r\na headache: but even at the expense of an aching head he had been\r\ncompelled to do some very deep thinking as he journeyed to New York in\r\nthe train. From somewhere in the muddy depths of his sub-consciousness\r\nit was imperative that he should bring to the surface the name of the\r\npoliceman to whom he had sold that stock. He started the dredging\r\noperations immediately, and by the time the train had reached the\r\nPennsylvania Station had succeeded in narrowing the search down to this\r\nextent,--that he felt sure the man was called either Mulcahy or Garrity.\r\n\r\nNow, a man who goes about New York looking for a policeman named\r\nMulcahy has quite an afternoon's work in hand. So has the man who\r\nseeks a Garrity. For one who pursues both there is not a dull moment.\r\nFlitting hither and thither about the city and questioning the various\r\nofficers he encountered, Sigsbee H. Waddington soon began to cover\r\nground. The policeman on point duty in Times Square said that there was\r\na Mulcahy up near Grant's Tomb and a choice of Garritys at Columbus\r\nCircle and Irving Place. The Grant's Tomb Mulcahy, expressing regret\r\nthat he could not himself supply the happy ending, recommended the\r\nHundred-and-Twenty-Fifth Street Mulcahy or--alternately--the one down\r\non Third Avenue and Sixteenth. The Garrity at Columbus Circle spoke\r\nhighly of a Garrity near the Battery, and the Garrity at Irving Place\r\nseemed to think his cousin up in the Bronx might fill the long-felt\r\nwant. By this time the clocks were striking five, Mr. Waddington had\r\ncome definitely to the decision that what the world wanted to make\r\nit a place fit for heroes to live in was fewer and better Mulcahys.\r\nAt five-thirty, returning from the Bronx, he would have supported\r\nany amendment to the Constitution which Congress might have cared\r\nto introduce, totally prohibiting Garritys. At six sharp, he became\r\nsuddenly convinced that the name of the man he sought was Murphy.\r\n\r\nHe was passing through Madison Square at the moment, having just\r\nflushed Fourteenth Street for another Mulcahy: and so deeply did this\r\nnew idea affect him that he tottered to one of the benches and, sitting\r\ndown, groaned heavily. It was the breaking-point. Mr. Waddington\r\ndecided to give it up and go home. His head was aching, his feet\r\nwere aching, and the small of his back was aching. The first fine\r\ncareless rapture with which he had started his quest had ebbed away to\r\nnothing. In short, if there was one man in New York utterly incapable\r\nof going about the place looking for Murphys, that man was Sigsbee H.\r\nWaddington. He limped to the Pennsylvania Station and took the next\r\ntrain home, and here he was, approaching journey's end.\r\n\r\nThe house, as he drew near, seemed very silent. And, of course, it\r\nhad every right to be. Long since, the wedding must have taken place\r\nand the happy pair departed on their honeymoon. Long since, the last\r\nguest must have left. And now, beneath that quiet roof, there remained\r\nonly Mrs. Waddington, no doubt trying out blistering phrases in the\r\nseclusion of her boudoir--here, discarding an incandescent adjective in\r\nfavour of a still zippier one that had just suggested itself; there,\r\nrealising that the noun 'worm' was too mild and searching in Roget's\r\nThesaurus for something more expressive. Mr. Waddington paused on the\r\ndoor-step, half inclined to make for the solitude of the tool-shed.\r\n\r\nManlier counsels prevailed. In the tool-shed there would be nothing to\r\ndrink, and, cost what it might, a drink was what his suffering soul\r\ndemanded. He crossed the threshold, and leaped nimbly as a dark figure\r\nsuddenly emerged from the telephone-booth.\r\n\r\n\"Oosh!\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\" said the figure.\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington felt relieved. It was not his wife. It was Ferris.\r\nAnd Ferris was the one person he particularly wanted at that moment\r\nto meet. For it was Ferris who could most expeditiously bring him\r\nsomething to drink.\r\n\r\n\"Sh!\" whispered Sigsbee H. \"Anyone about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Mrs. Waddington?\"\r\n\r\n\"In her boudoir, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. had expected as much.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone in the library?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then bring me a drink in there, Ferris. And don't tell anybody you've\r\nseen me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington shambled to the library and flung himself down on the\r\nchesterfield. Delicious, restful moments passed, and then a musical\r\ntinkling made itself heard without. Ferris entered with a tray.\r\n\r\n\"You omitted to give me definite instructions, sir,\" said the butler,\r\n\"so, acting on my own initiative, I have brought the whisky-decanter\r\nand some charged water.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke coldly, for he disapproved of Mr. Waddington. But the latter\r\nwas in no frame of mind to analyse the verbal nuances of butlers. He\r\nclutched at the decanter, his eyes moist with gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Splendid fellow, Ferris!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the sort of fellow who ought to be out West, where men are men.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler twitched a frosty eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"Will that be all, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But don't go, Ferris. Tell me about everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"On what particular point did you desire information, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about the wedding. I wasn't able to be present. I had most\r\nimportant business in New York, Ferris. So I wasn't able to be present.\r\nBecause I had most important business in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most important business. Impossible to neglect it. Did the wedding go\r\noff all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not altogether, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"There has been no wedding, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington sat up. The butler appeared to be babbling. And the\r\none moment when a man does not want to mix with babbling butlers is\r\nimmediately after he has returned home from a search through New York\r\nfor a policeman named Mulcahy or Garrity.\r\n\r\n\"No wedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the last moment a hitch occurred, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me the new clergyman sprained his ankle, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. The presiding minister continues to enjoy good health in\r\nevery respect. The hitch to which I allude was caused by a young woman\r\nwho, claiming to be an old friend of the bridegroom, entered the room\r\nwhere the guests were assembled and created some little disturbance,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington's eyes bulged.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about this,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe butler fixed a fathomless gaze on the wall beyond him.\r\n\r\n\"I was not actually present at the scene myself, sir. But one of the\r\nlower servants, who chanced to be glancing in at the door, has apprised\r\nme of the details of the occurrence. It appears that, just as the\r\nwedding-party was about to start off for the church, a young woman\r\nsuddenly made her way through the French windows opening to the lawn,\r\nand, pausing in the entrance, observed 'George! George! Why did you\r\ndesert me? You don't belong to that girl there. You belong to me,--the\r\nwoman you have wronged!' Addressing Mr. Finch, I gather.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington's eyes were now protruding to such a dangerous extent\r\nthat a sharp jerk would have caused them to drop off.\r\n\r\n\"Sweet suffering soup-spoons! What happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was considerable uproar and confusion, so my informant tells\r\nme. The bridegroom was noticeably taken aback, and protested with some\r\nurgency that it was all a mistake. To which Mrs. Waddington replied\r\nthat it was just what she had foreseen all along. Miss Waddington, I\r\ngather, was visibly affected. And the guests experienced no little\r\nembarrassment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't blame them.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The young woman was pressed for details, but appeared to be in an\r\noverwrought and highly emotional condition. She screamed, so my\r\ninformant tells me, and wrung her hands. She staggered about the room\r\nand, collapsing on the table where the wedding-presents had been\r\nplaced, seemed to swoon. Almost immediately afterwards, however, she\r\nappeared to recover herself: and, remarking 'Air! Air! I want air!'\r\ndeparted hastily through the French windows. I understand, sir, that\r\nnothing was seen of her after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Waddington refused to permit the wedding to take place. The\r\nguests returned to New York. Mr. Finch, after uttering certain protests\r\nwhich my informant could not hear distinctly but which appear to\r\nhave been incoherent and unconvincing, also took his departure. Mrs.\r\nWaddington has for some little time past been closeted in the boudoir\r\nwith Miss Waddington. A very unpleasant affair, sir, and one which\r\ncould never have occurred at Brangmarley Hall.\"\r\n\r\nOne hates to have to record it, but it is a fact that the first emotion\r\nwhich came to Sigsbee H. Waddington after the waning of his initial\r\namazement was relief. It was not the thought of this broken romance\r\nthat occupied his mind, nor pity for the poor girl who had played the\r\nprincipal part in the tragedy. The aspect of the matter that touched\r\nhim most nearly was the fact that he was not in for trouble, after\r\nall. His absence had probably escaped notice, and that wifely lecture\r\nto which he had been looking forward so apprehensively would never be\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nAnd then, cutting through relief, came a sudden thought that chilled\r\nhis satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a girl was it that came in through the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"My informant describes her as small, sir, and of a neat figure. She\r\nhad a _retroussé_ nose and expressive black eyes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Godfrey!\" ejaculated Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\nHe sprang from the sofa and, despite his aching feet, made good time\r\nalong the hall. He ran into the dining-room and switched on the light.\r\nHe darted across the room to the table where the wedding-presents lay.\r\nAt first glance, they seemed to be all there, but a second look showed\r\nhim that his suspicions had been well-founded.\r\n\r\nThe case containing the necklace was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most sustaining gifts a man can possess is the ability to\r\nlook upon the bright side of disaster. It was a gift which, until\r\nnow, Sigsbee H. Waddington had lacked almost entirely: but at this\r\nmoment, owing perhaps to the fact that he had just introduced into his\r\ninterior a healing drink of quite exceptional strength, he suddenly\r\nfound himself discerning with a limpid clearness the fact that the\r\nelimination of that near-pearl necklace from the scheme of things was,\r\nfrom his point of view, the very best thing that could have happened.\r\n\r\nIt had not been his intention to allow his young assistant to secure\r\nthe necklace and convert it to her own uses: but, now that this had\r\nhappened, what, he asked himself, had he to worry about? The main thing\r\nwas that the necklace had disappeared. Coming right down to it, that\r\nwas the consummation at which he had aimed all along.\r\n\r\nWhat it amounted to was that, when all the tumult and the shouting\r\nhad died, he was three hundred dollars in hand and consequently in a\r\nposition, if he ever met that policeman again and the policeman had not\r\nhappened to hear the news which United Beef had told him, to....\r\n\r\nAt this point in his meditations Mr. Waddington suddenly broke off and\r\nuttered a sharp exclamation. For before his eyes in letters of fire\r\nthere seemed to be written the one word\r\n\r\n                               GALLAGHER\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington reeled in his tracks. Gallagher! That was the\r\nname. Not Mulcahy. Not Garrity. Not Murphy. Gallagher!\r\n\r\nLike many another good man before him, Sigsbee Waddington chafed at the\r\nfat-headed imbecility with which Memory can behave. Why should Memory\r\nhave presented to his notice futile Mulcahys and Garritys and Murphys\r\nwhen what he had been asking for was Gallagher? Wasting his time!\r\n\r\nBut it was not too late. If he went straight back to New York now\r\nand resumed his quest, all might yet be well. And Fortune had, he\r\nperceived, presented him with the most admirable excuse for going\r\nstraight back to New York. In a crisis like this, with a valuable pearl\r\nnecklace stolen it was imperative that a cool-headed, clear-thinking\r\nman of the world should take the next train up and place the facts in\r\nthe possession of Police Headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"Good enough!\" said Mr. Waddington to his immortal soul; and hobbled\r\nstiffly but light-heartedly to the boudoir.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVoices reached his ears as he opened the door. They ceased as he\r\nentered, and Mrs. Waddington looked up peevishly.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been, I should like to know?\" she said.\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. was ready for this one.\r\n\r\n\"I took a long country walk. A very long country walk. I was so\r\nshocked, horrified and surprised by that dreadful scene that the house\r\nseemed to stifle me. So I took a long country walk. I have just got\r\nback. What a very disturbing thing to happen! Ferris says it could\r\nnever have occurred at Brangmarley Hall.\"\r\n\r\nMolly, somewhat red about the eyes and distinctly mutinous about the\r\nmouth, spoke for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure there is some explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tchah!\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"I know there is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did not your precious Finch condescend to give it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was so taken aback.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure there was some mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was,\" said Mr. Waddington. He patted his daughter's hand\r\nsoothingly. \"The whole thing was a put-up job.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindly talk sense, Sigsbee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am talking sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you call sense, perhaps, but not what anyone outside the walls of\r\nan institution for the feeble-minded would call sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is zat so?\" Mr. Waddington put his thumbs in the armholes of his\r\nwaistcoat and felt rather conquering. \"Well, let me tell you that that\r\ngirl simply pretended to be what she wasn't so as to fool you into\r\nthinking she wasn't what she was.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington sighed despairingly.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, Sigsbee,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right about Go away, Sigsbee. I'm telling you that that\r\ngirl was a crook. She couldn't get in any other way, so she pulled that\r\ndiscarded stuff. She was after the wedding-presents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did she not take them?\"\r\n\r\n\"She did. She took Molly's pearl necklace.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard. She took Molly's pearl necklace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's gone.\"\r\n\r\nMolly had risen with shining eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I thought as much. So my dear darling George is innocent after all.\"\r\n\r\nVery few people in this civilised world have ever seen a baffled\r\ntigress, but anybody who could have watched Mrs. Waddington's face at\r\nthis moment would have gained a very fair knowledge of how baffled\r\ntigresses look.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" she said sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the necklace has gone, hasn't it,\" said Sigsbee H. \"And you\r\ndon't suppose any of the guests took it, do you? Though I wouldn't put\r\nit past that Lord Hunstanton guy. Of course that girl has got it. She\r\nfainted on the wedding-present table, didn't she? She said she wanted\r\nair and rushed out, didn't she? And nobody's seen her since, have they?\r\nIf it hadn't been for going for my long country walk, I'd have got on\r\nto this hours ago.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going straight to New York to see George and tell him,\" said\r\nMolly, breathing quickly.\r\n\r\n\"You will do nothing of the kind,\" said Mrs. Waddington, rising.\r\n\r\n\"And I'm going to New York to see the police,\" said Sigsbee.\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly not! I will go to New York, and I will inform the\r\npolice. You and Molly will stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But listen....\"\r\n\r\n\"I want no further discussion.\" Mrs. Waddington pressed the bell. \"As\r\nfor you,\" she said, turning to Molly, \"do you suppose I am going to\r\nallow you to pay nocturnal visits to the apartments of libertines like\r\nGeorge Finch?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not a libertine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said Sigsbee H. \"A very fine young fellow. Comes from\r\nIdaho.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know perfectly well,\" Molly went on, \"that what father has told us\r\nabsolutely clears George. Why, the girl might just as well have come in\r\nand said that father had deserted her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" said Mr. Waddington. \"Hi!\"\r\n\r\n\"She only wanted an excuse for getting into the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" said Mrs. Waddington, \"that in this particular\r\ninstance George Finch is not so blameworthy as I had at first supposed.\r\nBut that does not alter the fact that he is a man whom any mother\r\nwith her daughter's happiness at heart must regard with the deepest\r\nsuspicion. He is an artist. He has deliberately chosen to live in a\r\nquarter of New York which is notorious for its loose-thinking and\r\nBohemian ways. And....\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened.\r\n\r\n\"You rang, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Ferris. Tell Bassett to bring the car round immediately. I am\r\ngoing into New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam.\" The butler coughed. \"I wonder, madam, if it is\r\nnot taking a liberty, if I might be permitted to ride on the box-seat\r\nbeside the chauffeur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nThere are occasions in life when to give one's true reasons for some\r\nparticular course of action would be tedious. The actual explanation\r\nof the butler's desire to visit the metropolis was that he wished\r\nto pay a call upon the editor of that bright and widely-read weekly\r\npaper, \"Town Gossip,\" in order to turn an honest penny by informing him\r\nof the sensational scene which had occurred that day in the highest\r\ncircles. Almost immediately after the facts of this scandal in high\r\nlife had been called to his attention, Ferris had started to telephone\r\nthe \"Town Gossip\" offices in order to establish communication, only\r\nto be informed that the editor was out of town. At his last attempt,\r\nhowever, a cautious assistant, convinced at length that the butler had\r\nsomething of real interest up his sleeve and was not disposed to reveal\r\nit to underlings, had recommended him to call upon L. Lancelot Biffen,\r\nthe editor-in-chief, at his private address on the ninth floor of the\r\nSheridan Apartment House, near Washington Square. Mr. Biffen, the\r\nassistant thought, would be back after dinner.\r\n\r\nAll this the butler could, of course, have revealed to his employer,\r\nbut, like all men of intellect, he disliked long explanations.\r\n\r\n\"I have just received a communication informing me that a near\r\nrelative of mine is ill in the city, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, madam. I will inform Bassett at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said Mrs. Waddington, as the door closed, going on where\r\nshe had been interrupted, \"for all we know, the girl's story may have\r\nbeen perfectly true, and her theft of the pearls the result of a sudden\r\ntemptation on the spur of the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why not? I suppose she was in need of money. No doubt your Finch\r\ncallously omitted to provide for her in any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got it all wrong,\" said Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about it?\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Sigsbee H., prudently.\r\n\r\n\"Then kindly refrain from talking nonsense.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington left the room with ponderous dignity, and Sigsbee H.,\r\nstill prudent, closed the door.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen, Molly,\" he said, \"I've got to get up to New York right\r\naway. I've just got to.\"\r\n\r\n\"So have I. I certainly mean to see George to-night. I suppose he has\r\ngone back to his apartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"What'll we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Directly the car has gone, I'll run you up in my two-seater.\"\r\n\r\n\"'At-a-baby!\" said Mr. Waddington fervently. \"That's the way to talk.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed his daughter fondly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington found the authorities at Police Headquarters charming.\r\nIt was some little time before they corrected their initial impression\r\nthat she had come to give herself up to justice for committing a\r\njewel-robbery: but, this done, they threw themselves heart and soul\r\ninto her cause and became extraordinarily helpful. True, they were\r\nforced to admit that the description which she gave of the thief\r\nconveyed absolutely nothing to them: but if it had done, they assured\r\nher, she would have been amazed at the remorseless speed with which the\r\nmachinery of the Law would have been set working.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, the girl had been tall and thin with shingled auburn\r\nhair, they would have spread the net at once for \"Chicago Kitty.\" If,\r\non the other hand, she had had a snub nose and two moles on her chin,\r\nthen every precinct would have been warned by telephone to keep an\r\neye out for \"Cincinnati Sue.\" While, if only she had limped slightly\r\nand spoken with a lisp, the arrest of \"Indianapolis Edna\" would have\r\nbeen a mere matter of hours. As it was, they were obliged to confess\r\nthemselves completely baffled: and Mrs. Waddington came away with the\r\nfeeling that, if she had not happened to possess large private means,\r\nshe could have gone into the jewel-stealing business herself and\r\ncleaned up big without any fear of unpleasant consequences. It was\r\nwrong of her, of course, to call the chief detective a fat-faced goop,\r\nbut by that time she had become a little annoyed.\r\n\r\nShe was still annoyed as she came out into the street, but the pleasant\r\nnight air had a cooling effect. She was able now to perceive that the\r\ntheft of the necklace was, after all, only a side-issue, and that there\r\nlay before her sterner work than the mere bringing to book of female\r\ncriminals. The consummation to which she must devote all her faculties\r\nwas the downfall of George Finch.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that she decided that she needed an ally, a\r\nsympathetic coadjutor who would trot along by her side and do what\r\nhe was told and generally supply aid and encouragement in the rather\r\ntricky operations on which she was about to embark. She went to a\r\npublic telephone-office and invested five cents in a local call.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Hunstanton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hullo?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Mrs. Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ah? Many happy returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of popping out and having a bit to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meet me at the Ritz-Carlton in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right-ho. Thanks, awfully. I will. Yes. Thanks. Right. Fine.\r\nAbsolutely. Right-ho.\"\r\n\r\nSo now we find Mrs. Waddington seated in the vestibule of the\r\nRitz-Carlton Hotel, watching the door like a cat at a mouse-hole and\r\ntapping the carpet impatiently with an ample shoe. Like everybody else\r\nwho has ever waited five minutes for anybody in a restaurant, she had\r\nthe illusion of having been there for several hours. But at last her\r\npatience was rewarded. An elegant figure shimmered through the doorway\r\nand came towards her, beaming with happy anticipation. Lord Hunstanton\r\nwas a man who combined a keen appetite with a rugged distaste for\r\npaying for his own meals, and the prospect of a dinner at the Ritz\r\nat somebody else's expense enchanted him. He did not actually lick\r\nhis lips, but as he looked brightly up the stairs to where benevolent\r\nwaiters were plying contented diners with food, there flitted across\r\nhis face a radiant smile.\r\n\r\n\"Hope I'm not late,\" said Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"I want to talk to you.\" And\r\nproceeded to do so at some length.\r\n\r\nLord Hunstanton blinked pathetically.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" he said, as his companion paused for breath. \"I\r\nknow it's all frightfully interesting, but I don't seem somehow to\r\nfollow. How would it be if we slid into the dining-room and thrashed\r\nthe whole thing out quietly over a thoughtful steak or something?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington eyed him with a distaste that bordered on contempt.\r\n\r\n\"You surely do not imagine that I propose to waste time eating?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\" His lordship's jaw fell an inch. \"Not eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. I will repeat what I was saying, and please listen\r\nattentively this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say! No dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"No soup?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fish? No nourishment of any description?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. We have no time to lose. We must act promptly and\r\nswiftly.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about a sand--...?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were present at that appalling scene this afternoon,\" said Mrs.\r\nWaddington, \"so there is no need to describe it to you. You will not\r\nhave forgotten how that girl came into the room and denounced George\r\nFinch. You recall all she said.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do indeed. It was the real ginger.\"\r\n\r\n\"But unfortunately untrue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a ruse. She was a thief. She did it in order to steal a\r\npearl necklace belonging to my stepdaughter, which was among the\r\nwedding-presents.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, really? I say! Fancy that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately there seems to be no doubt of it. And so, instead of\r\nbeing appalled at George Finch's moral turpitude, my stepdaughter looks\r\nupon him as a much-injured man and wishes the marriage to take place as\r\narranged. Are you listening?\"\r\n\r\nLord Hunstanton started. There had come frolicking towards him from the\r\ndining-room a lively young smell composed principally of tournedos and\r\ngravy, and his attention had wandered.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" he said. \"Thinking of something else for the moment. You\r\nwere saying that Miss Waddington was appalled at George Finch's moral\r\nturpitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was saying precisely the reverse. She is not appalled.\"\r\n\r\n\"No? Very broad-minded, these modern girls,\" said Lord Hunstanton,\r\nturning away and trying not to inhale.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" proceeded Mrs. Waddington, \"I am convinced that, although in\r\nthis particular matter this Finch may be blameless, his morals, if we\r\nonly knew it, are as degraded as those of all other artists. I feel as\r\ncertain as I am that I am sitting here that George Finch is a loose\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fish!\" moaned Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\n\"And I have made up my mind that there is only one thing to do if I am\r\nto expose the man in his true colours, and that is to go to the den\r\nwhich he maintains near Washington Square and question his man-servant\r\nas to his private life. We will start at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, I say, you don't need me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I need you. Do you imagine that I propose to call at this\r\nman's lair alone?\"\r\n\r\nAcross the landing at the top of the stairs there passed a waiter\r\nbearing a tray with a smoking dish upon it. Lord Hunstanton followed\r\nhim with haggard eyes: and, having watched him enter the restaurant,\r\nwished he had not done so, for there by one of the tables stood another\r\nwaiter carving for a party of four what looked like the roast chicken\r\nof a lifetime,--one of those roast chickens you tell your grandchildren\r\nabout. His lordship uttered a faint, whinnying sound and clenched his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"Let us go.\"\r\n\r\nThe thought of defying this overpowering woman did not enter Lord\r\nHunstanton's mind. Nobody ever defied Mrs. Waddington. And so, some\r\nlittle time later, a cab drew up outside the Sheridan Apartment House\r\nand two figures proceeded to climb the stairs--for it was one of the\r\npleasing features of the Sheridan that the elevator was practically\r\nalways out of order.\r\n\r\nArrived at the top floor, Lord Hunstanton rang the bell. The sound\r\nechoed faintly within.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to be out,\" said his lordship, having tried again.\r\n\r\n\"We will wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, here?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Until this Finch's man-servant returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he may be hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will wait hours.\"\r\n\r\nLord Hunstanton's aching interior urged him to protest. \"Be brave!\"\r\nit gurgled. And, whilst still not sufficiently courageous to defy, he\r\nnerved himself to make a suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"How would it be,\" he said, \"if I just pushed round the corner\r\nsomewhere and snatched a bite? I mean to say, you never know whether\r\nthis man-servant fellow won't turn nasty. Sticking up for the young\r\nmaster, I mean to say. In which case, I should be twice the man with a\r\nbit of food inside me. With a dish of beans or something nicely poised\r\nwithin, I could do my bit.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington regarded him scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. But kindly return as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I will, by Jove! Just want to pack away a hasty prune. I'll be\r\nback before you know I've gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find me on the roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the roof. Right! Well, tinkety-tonk, then, for the moment,\" said\r\nhis lordship, and pattered off down the stairs.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington mounted another flight, and came out under the broad\r\ncanopy of heaven. She found herself with a choice of views, the\r\nglittering city that stretched away below and the dark windows of the\r\nFinch lair. She chose the windows and watched them narrowly.\r\n\r\nShe had been watching them for some considerable time, when suddenly\r\nthe middle ones, the French windows, lit up. And, as she stepped\r\nforward, her rosiest dreams were realised. Across the yellow blind\r\nthere passed a shadow which was plainly that of a young female person,\r\nno doubt of a grade of morality so low that in any other place but\r\nWashington Square it would have provoked the raised eyebrow and the\r\nsharp intake of the breath. Mrs. Waddington advanced to the window and\r\ntapped upon it imperiously.\r\n\r\nThere was a startled exclamation from within. The blind shot up,\r\nrevealing a stoutish man in sober black. The next moment the window was\r\nopened, and the stoutish man popped his head out.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Jiminy Christmas!\" said the stoutish man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nFrederick Mullett had been in a nervous frame of mind all the\r\nafternoon, more nervous even than that of the ordinary bridegroom on\r\nhis wedding-day. For he had been deeply exercised for many hours past\r\nby the problem of what his bride had been up to that afternoon.\r\n\r\nAny bridegroom would be upset if his newly-made wife left him\r\nimmediately after the ceremony on the plea that she had important\r\nbusiness to attend to and would see him later. Frederick Mullett was\r\nparticularly upset. It was not so much the fact that he had planned\r\na golden afternoon of revelry including a visit to Coney Island and\r\nhad had to forgo it that disturbed him. That the delightful programme\r\nshould have been cancelled was, of course, a disappointment: but what\r\nreally caused him mental anguish was the speculation as to what from\r\nthe view-point of a girl like Fanny constituted important business. Her\r\nreticence on this vital question had spoiled his whole day.\r\n\r\nHe was, in short, in exactly the frame of mind when a man who has\r\nmarried a pickpocket and has watched her go off on important business\r\ndoes not want to hear people tapping sharply on windows. If a mouse\r\nhad crossed the floor at that moment, Frederick Mullett would have\r\nsuspected it of being a detective in disguise. He peered at Mrs.\r\nWaddington with cold horror.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to see and question the young woman who is in this apartment.\"\r\n\r\nMullett's mouth felt dry. A shiver ran down his spine.\r\n\r\n\"What young woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come!\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't any young woman here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut!\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington's direct mind was impatient of this attempt to deceive.\r\n\r\n\"I will make it worth your while to tell the truth,\" she said.\r\n\r\nMullett recoiled. The thought that he was being asked to sell his bride\r\non the very day of their wedding revolted him. Not that he would have\r\nsold her at any time, of course, but being asked to do so on this day\r\nof all days made the thing seem, as Officer Garroway would have said,\r\nso peculiarly stark and poignant.\r\n\r\nWith a frenzied gesture of abhorrence he slammed the window. He\r\nswitched off the light and with agonised bounds reached the kitchen,\r\nwhere Mrs. Frederick Mullett was standing at the range stirring a welsh\r\nrarebit.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, sweetie!\" cooed his bride, looking up. \"I'm just fixing the\r\nrabbit. The soup's ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we're in it,\" said Mullett hollowly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, whatever do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fanny, where did you go this afternoon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just down into the country, dearie. I told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you didn't tell me what you did there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a secret for the present, darling. I want to keep it as a\r\nsurprise. It's something to do with some money that's coming to us.\"\r\n\r\nMullett eyed her wanly.\r\n\r\n\"Fanny, were you doing a job this afternoon down there in the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Freddy Mullett! What an idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what are the bulls here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bulls!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a female dick out on the roof right now. And she's asking for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nFanny stared, round-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"Asking for me? You're crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"She said 'I wish to see and question the young woman who is in this\r\napartment.' Those were her very words.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take a peek at her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let her see you,\" begged Mullett, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Is it likely!\"\r\n\r\nFanny walked composedly to the sitting-room. She felt no concern.\r\nThe most comforting possession in the world is, of course, a quiet\r\nconscience: but almost as good is the knowledge that you have left no\r\ntracks behind you. Fanny was positive that, on taking her departure\r\nfrom the Waddington home at Hempstead that afternoon, she had made\r\na nice clean getaway and could not possibly have been followed to\r\nthis place by even the most astute of female dicks. Mullett, she was\r\nconvinced, must have misunderstood this woman, whoever she might be.\r\n\r\nShe drew the blind aside an inch and looked cautiously out. The\r\nintruder was standing so close to the window that it was possible even\r\nin the uncertain light to get an adequate view of her: and what she\r\nsaw reassured Fanny. She returned to her anxious husband with words of\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\n\"That's no dick,\" she said. \"I can tell 'em a mile off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better ask her. Listen, you go and kid her along and I'll sneak\r\nout. Then we can meet somewhere when you're through. It's a shame\r\nhaving to waste this nice supper, but we'll go to a restaurant. Listen,\r\nI'll be waiting for you at the Astor.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if she's not a dick, why not stay where we are?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't want people knowing that I'm here, do you? Suppose your boss\r\nheard of it, what would he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true. All right, then. Wait for me at the Astor. Though it's\r\nkind of a swell place, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't you want a swell place to dine at on your wedding-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm always right,\" said Fanny, giving her husband's cheek a loving\r\npinch. \"That's the first thing you've got to get into your head, now\r\nyou're a married man.\"\r\n\r\nMullett returned to the sitting-room and switched on the light again.\r\nHe felt fortified. He opened the window with something of an air.\r\n\r\n\"You were saying, ma'am?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington was annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by going away and slamming the window in my face?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had to see to something in the kitchen, ma'am. Is there anything I can\r\ndo for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is. I wish to know who the young woman is who is in the\r\napartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"No young woman in this apartment, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington began to feel that she was approaching this matter\r\nfrom the wrong angle. She dipped in her bag.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a ten-dollar bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to ask you a few questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I shall be obliged if you will answer them truthfully. How long\r\nhave you been in Mr. Finch's employment?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a couple of months, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is your opinion of Mr. Finch's morals?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're swell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. Don't attempt to deceive me. Is it not a fact that during\r\nyour term of employment you have frequently admitted female visitors to\r\nthis apartment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only models, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Models!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch is an artist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am aware of it,\" said Mrs. Waddington with a shiver. \"So you persist\r\nin your statement that Mr. Finch's mode of life is not irregular?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Mrs. Waddington, twitching the ten-dollar bill neatly from\r\nhis grasp, \"It may interest you to know that I do not believe you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, hey!\" cried Mullett, deeply moved. \"You gave me that!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have taken it back,\" said Mrs. Waddington, replacing the bill in\r\nher bag. \"You do not deserve it.\"\r\n\r\nMullett slammed the window, outraged in his finest feelings. For\r\nsome moments he stood, fermenting. Then, seething with justifiable\r\nindignation, he switched off the light once more and went out.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the foot of the stairs, when he heard his name spoken,\r\nand, turning, was aware of a long policeman regarding him with a mild\r\nfriendliness.\r\n\r\n\"Surely it is Mr. Mullett?\" said the policeman.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo?\" said Mullett, somewhat embarrassed. Habit is not easily\r\novercome, and there had been a time when the mere sight of a policeman\r\nhad made him tremble like a leaf.\r\n\r\n\"You remember me? My name is Garroway. We met some weeks ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sure,\" said Mullett, relieved. \"You're the poet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very nice of you to say so,\" said Officer Garroway, simpering\r\na little. \"I am about to call at Mr. Beamish's apartment now with my\r\nlatest effort. And how has the world been using you, Mr. Mullett?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Everything hunky-dory with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Completely. Well, I must not detain you. No doubt you are on your way\r\nto some important appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. Say!\" said Mullett, suddenly inspired. \"Are you on duty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you wouldn't object to making a cop?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means. I am always willing--and, indeed, anxious--to make a cop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there was a suspicious character on our roof just now. A woman.\r\nI didn't like the look of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? This is extremely interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was snooping around, looking in at our windows, and I don't think\r\nshe's up to any good. You might go and ask her what she wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will attend to the matter immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I was you, I'd pinch her on suspicion. So long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Mr. Mullett.\"\r\n\r\nMullett, with the elation which comes from a good deed done, moved\r\nbuoyantly off to his tryst. Officer Garroway, swinging his night-stick,\r\nclimbed thoughtfully up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington, meanwhile, had not been content with a policy of\r\nwatchful waiting. She was convinced that the shadow which she had seen\r\non the blind had been that of a young woman: and instinct told her that\r\nin an apartment near Washington Square where there was a young woman\r\npresent events were not likely to remain static for any considerable\r\nlength of time. No doubt the man she had questioned would have warned\r\nthe young woman of her visit, and by now she had probably gone away.\r\nBut she would return. And George Finch would return. It was simply a\r\nquestion of exercising patience.\r\n\r\nBut she must leave the roof. The roof was the first place the guilty\r\npair would examine. If they found it empty, their fears would be\r\nlulled. The strategic move indicated was to go downstairs and patrol\r\nthe street. There she could stay until things began to happen again.\r\n\r\nShe was about to move away, and had already taken a step towards the\r\ndoor that led to the stairs, when a slight creaking noise attracted her\r\nattention and she was surprised to observe the window swinging open.\r\n\r\nIt opened some six inches: then, caught by a gust of wind, closed\r\nagain. A moment later, there was another creak and it moved outward\r\nonce more. Apparently, in the agony of losing his ten dollars, the man\r\nhad omitted to fasten the catch.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington stopped. She drew a step nearer. She grasped the handle\r\nand, pulling the window wide open, peered into the dark room. It seemed\r\nto be empty, but Mrs. Waddington was a cautious woman.\r\n\r\n\"My man!\" she called.\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\nMore silence. Mrs. Waddington applied the supreme test.\r\n\r\n\"I want to return that ten-dollar bill to you.\"\r\n\r\nStill silence. Mrs. Waddington was convinced. She crossed the threshold\r\nand started to feel round the walls for the switch. And, as she did so,\r\nsomething came to her through the throbbing darkness.\r\n\r\nIt was the smell of soup.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington stiffened like a pointing dog. Although when sitting\r\nin the vestibule of the Ritz-Carlton with Lord Hunstanton she had\r\napparently been impervious to the fragrant scents which had so deeply\r\naffected his lordship, she was human. It was long past the hour at\r\nwhich she usually dined, and in the matter of sustenance she was a\r\nwoman of regular habits. Already, while standing on the roof, she\r\nhad been aware of certain pangs, and now she realised beyond all\r\npossibility of doubt that she was hungry. She quivered from head to\r\nfoot. The smell of that soup seemed to call to the deeps of her being\r\nlike the voice of an old, old love.\r\n\r\nMoving forward like one in a trance, she groped along the wall, and\r\nfound herself in an open doorway that appeared to lead into a passage.\r\nHere, away from the window, the darkness was blacker than ever: but,\r\nif she could not see, she could smell, and she needed no other guide\r\nthan her nose. She walked along the passage, sniffing, and, coming to\r\nanother open door, found the scent so powerful that she almost reeled.\r\nIt had become a composite odour now, with a strong welsh rarebit motif\r\nplaying through it. Mrs. Waddington felt for the switch, pressed it\r\ndown, and saw that she was in a kitchen. And there, simmering on the\r\nrange, was a saucepan.\r\n\r\nThere are moments when even the most single-minded of women will allow\r\nherself to be distracted from the main object of her thoughts. Mrs.\r\nWaddington had reached the stage where soup seemed to her the most\r\nimportant--if not the only--thing in life. She removed the lid from the\r\nsaucepan, and a meaty steaminess touched her like a kiss.\r\n\r\nShe drew a deep breath. She poured some of the soup into a plate. She\r\nfound a spoon. She found bread. She found salt. She found pepper.\r\n\r\nAnd it was while she was lovingly sprinkling the pepper that a voice\r\nspoke behind her.\r\n\r\n\"You're pinched!\" said the voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nThere were not many things which could have diverted Mrs. Waddington's\r\nattention at that moment from the plate before her. An earthquake might\r\nhave done it. So might the explosion of a bomb. This voice accomplished\r\nit instantaneously. She spun round with a sharp scream, her heart\r\nfeeling as if it were performing one of those eccentric South Seas\r\ndances whose popularity she had always deplored.\r\n\r\nA policeman was standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Arrested, I should have said,\" added the policeman with a touch of\r\napology. He seemed distressed that in the first excitement of this\r\nencounter he had failed to achieve the Word Beautiful.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington was not a woman often at a loss for speech, but she\r\ncould find none now. She stood panting.\r\n\r\n\"I must ask you, if you will be so good,\" said the policeman\r\ncourteously, \"to come along with me. And it will avoid a great deal of\r\nunpleasantness if you come quietly.\"\r\n\r\nThe torpor consequent upon the disintegrating shock of this meeting\r\nbegan to leave Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"I can explain!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"You will have every opportunity of doing so at the station-house,\"\r\nsaid the policeman. \"In your own interests I should advise you until\r\nthen to say as little as possible. For I must warn you that in\r\npursuance of my duty I shall take a memorandum of any statement which\r\nyou may make. See, I have my note-book and pencil here in readiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was doing no harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, is for the judge to decide. I need scarcely point out that\r\nyour presence in this apartment is, to say the least, equivocal. You\r\ncame in through a window,--an action which constitutes breaking and\r\nentering, and, furthermore, I find you in the act of purloining the\r\nproperty of the owner of the apartment,--to wit, soup. I am afraid I\r\nmust ask you to accompany me.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington started to clasp her hands in a desperate appeal: and,\r\ndoing so, was aware that some obstacle prevented this gesture.\r\n\r\nIt was suddenly borne in upon her that she was still holding the\r\npepper-pot. And suddenly a thought came like a full-blown rose,\r\nflushing her brow.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the policeman.\r\n\r\nEverything in this world, every little experience which we undergo or\r\neven merely read about, is intended, philosophers tell us, to teach\r\nus something, to help to equip us for the battle of life. It was\r\nnot, according to this theory, mere accident, therefore, which a few\r\ndays before had caused Mrs. Waddington to read and sub-consciously\r\nmemorise the report that had appeared in the evening paper to which she\r\nsubscribed of a burglary at the residence of a certain leading citizen\r\nof West Orange, New Jersey. The story had been sent to help her.\r\n\r\nOf the less important details of this affair she retained no\r\nrecollection: but the one salient point in connection with it came back\r\nto her now with all the force of an inspiration from above. Cornered\r\nby an indignant householder, she recalled, the West Orange burglar had\r\nmade his escape by the simple means of throwing about two ounces of\r\npepper in the householder's face.\r\n\r\nWhat this humble, probably uneducated man had been able to achieve was\r\nsurely not beyond the powers of a woman like herself,--the honorary\r\npresident of twenty-three charitable societies and a well-known\r\nlecturer on the upbringing of infants. Turning coyly sideways, she\r\nbegan to unscrew the top of the pot.\r\n\r\n\"You will understand,\" said the policeman deprecatingly, \"that this is\r\nextremely unpleasant for me....\"\r\n\r\nHe was perfectly right. Unpleasant, he realised a moment later, was the\r\nexact adjective which the most punctilious stylist would have chosen.\r\nFor suddenly the universe seemed to dissolve in one great cloud-burst\r\nof pepper. Pepper tickled his mouth: pepper filled his nose: pepper\r\nstrayed into his eyes and caressed his Adam's apple. For an instant he\r\nwrithed blindly: then, clutching at the table for support, he began to\r\nsneeze.\r\n\r\nWith the sound of those titanic sneezes ringing in her ears, Mrs.\r\nWaddington bumped her way through the darkness till she came to the\r\nopen window: then, galloping across the roof, hurled herself down the\r\nfire-escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\nThe only thing in the nature of a policy or plan of action which Mrs.\r\nWaddington had had when making for the fire-escape had been a general\r\ndesire to be as far away as possible from the representative of the Law\r\nwhen he stopped sneezing and opened his eyes and began to look around\r\nhim for his assailant. But, as her feet touched the first rungs, more\r\ndefinite schemes began to shape themselves. Fire-escapes, she knew,\r\nled, if followed long enough, to the ground: and she decided to climb\r\nto safety down this one. It was only when she had descended as far as\r\nthe ninth floor that, glancing below her, she discovered that this\r\nparticular fire-escape terminated not, as she had supposed, in some\r\nback-alley, but in the gaily-lighted outdoor premises of a restaurant,\r\nhalf the tables of which were already filled.\r\n\r\nThis sight gave her pause. In fact, to be accurate, it froze her\r\nstiff. Nor was her agitation without reason. Those of the readers of\r\nthis chronicle who have ever thrown pepper in a policeman's face, and\r\nskimmed away down a fire-escape are aware that fire-escapes, considered\r\nas a refuge, have the defect of being uncomfortably exposed to view.\r\nAt any moment, felt Mrs. Waddington, the policeman might come to the\r\nedge of the roof and look down: and to deceive him into supposing that\r\nshe was merely an ash-can or a milk-bottle was, she knew, beyond her\r\nhistrionic powers.\r\n\r\nThe instinct for self-preservation not only sharpens the wits, but\r\nat the same time dulls the moral sensibility. It was so with Mrs.\r\nWaddington now. Her quickened intelligence perceived in a flash that if\r\nshe climbed in through the window outside which she was now standing\r\nshe would be safe from scrutiny: and her blunted moral sense refused\r\nto consider the fact that such an action--amounting, as it did, to\r\nwhat her policeman playmate had called breaking and entering--would be\r\nmost reprehensible. Besides, she had broken and entered one apartment\r\nalready that night, and the appetite grows by what it feeds on. Some\r\nten seconds later, therefore, Mrs. Waddington was once more groping\r\nthrough the darkness of somebody else's dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nA well-defined scent of grease, damp towels and old cabbages told\r\nher that the room through which she was creeping was a kitchen:\r\nbut the blackness was so uniform that she could see nothing of her\r\nsurroundings. The only thing she was able to say definitely of this\r\nkitchen at the moment was that it contained a broom. This she knew\r\nbecause she had just stepped on the end of it and the handle had shot\r\nup and struck her very painfully on the forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Ouch!\" cried Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\nShe had not intended to express any verbal comment on the incident, for\r\nthose who creep at night through other people's kitchens must be silent\r\nand wary: but the sudden agony was so keen that she could not refrain\r\nfrom comment. And to her horror she found that her cry had been heard.\r\nThere came through the darkness a curious noise like the drawing of a\r\ncork, and then somebody spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" said an unpleasant, guttural voice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington stopped, paralysed. She would not, in the\r\ncircumstances, have heard with any real pleasure the most musical\r\nof speech: but a soft, sympathetic utterance would undoubtedly have\r\nafflicted her with a shade less of anguish and alarm. This voice was\r\nthe voice of one without human pity; a grating, malevolent voice; a\r\nvoice that set Mrs. Waddington thinking quiveringly in headlines:\r\n\r\n'SOCIETY LEADER FOUND SLAIN IN KITCHEN.'\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n'BODY DISMEMBERED BENEATH SINK.'\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n'SEVERED HEAD LEADS TRACKERS TO DEATH-SPOT.'\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington gulped.\r\n\r\n\"I am Mrs. Sigsbee H. Waddington,\" she faltered. And it would have\r\namazed Sigsbee H., had he heard her, to discover that it was possible\r\nfor her to speak with such a winning meekness.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Sigsbee H. Waddington, of East Seventy-Ninth Street and\r\nHempstead, Long Island. I must apologise for the apparent strangeness\r\nof my conduct in....\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\nAnnoyance began to compete with Mrs. Waddington's terror. Deaf persons\r\nhad always irritated her, for like so many women of an impatient\r\nand masterful turn of mind she was of opinion that they could hear\r\nperfectly well if they took the trouble. She raised her voice and\r\nanswered with a certain stiffness.\r\n\r\n\"I have already informed you that I am Mrs. Sigsbee H. Waddington....\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a nut,\" said the voice, changing the subject.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington's teeth came together with a sharp click. All the other\r\nemotions which had been afflicting her passed abruptly away, to be\r\nsucceeded by a cold fury. Few things are more mortifying to a proud\r\nwoman than the discovery that she had been wasting her time being\r\nrespectful to a parrot: and only her inability to locate the bird in\r\nthe surrounding blackness prevented a rather unpleasant brawl. Had she\r\nbeen able to come to grips with it, Mrs. Waddington at that moment\r\nwould undoubtedly have done the parrot no good whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Brrh!\" she exclaimed, expressing her indignation as effectively as\r\nwas possible by mere speech: and, ignoring the other's request--in\r\nthe circumstances, ill-timed and tasteless--that she should stop and\r\nscratch its head, she pushed forward in search of the door.\r\n\r\nReaction had left her almost calm. The trepidation of a few moments\r\nback had vanished; and she advanced now in a brisk and business-like\r\nway. She found the door and opened it. There was more darkness beyond,\r\nbut an uncurtained window gave sufficient light for her to see that she\r\nwas in a sitting-room. Across one corner of this room lay a high-backed\r\nchesterfield. In another corner stood a pedestal desk. And about the\r\nsoft carpet there were distributed easy chairs in any one of which\r\nMrs. Waddington, had the conditions been different, would have been\r\ndelighted to sit and rest.\r\n\r\nBut, though she had been on her feet some considerable time now and\r\nwas not a woman who enjoyed standing, prudence warned her that the\r\ntemptation to relax must be resisted. It was a moment for action, not\r\nrepose. She turned to the door which presumably led into the front hall\r\nand thence to the stairs and safety: and had just opened it when there\r\ncame the click of a turning key.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington acted swiftly. The strange calm which had been upon her\r\ndissolved into a panic fear. She darted back into the sitting-room:\r\nand, taking the chesterfield in an inspired bound, sank down behind it\r\nand tried not to snort.\r\n\r\n\"Been waiting long?\" asked some person unseen, switching on the light\r\nand addressing an invisible companion.\r\n\r\nThe voice was strange to Mrs. Waddington: but about the one that\r\nreplied to it there was something so fruitily familiar that she\r\nstiffened where she lay, scarcely able to credit her senses. For it was\r\nthe voice of Ferris, her butler. And Ferris, if the truth was in him,\r\nshould by now have been at the sick-bed of a relative.\r\n\r\n\"Some little time, sir, but it has caused me no inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you want to see me about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am addressing Mr. Lancelot Biffen, the editor-in-chief of 'Town\r\nGossip'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Talk quick. I've got to go out again in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, Mr. Biffen, that 'Town Gossip' is glad to receive and\r\npay a substantial remuneration for items of interest concerning those\r\nprominent in New York Society. I have such an item.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's it about?\"\r\n\r\n\"My employer,--Mrs. Sigsbee H. Waddington, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's she been doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a long story....\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I haven't time to listen to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It concerns the sensational interruption to the marriage of Mrs.\r\nWaddington's stepdaughter....\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't the wedding come off, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. And the circumstances which prevented it....\"\r\n\r\nMr. Biffen uttered an exclamation. He had apparently looked at his\r\nwatch and been dismayed by the flight of time.\r\n\r\n\"I must run,\" he said. \"I've a date at the Algonquin in a quarter of an\r\nhour. Come and talk to me at the office to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear that will be impossible, sir, owing to....\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, see here. Have you ever done any writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. At Little-Seeping-in-the-Wold I frequently contributed short\r\narticles to the parish magazine. The vicar spoke highly of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then sit down and write the thing out. Use your own words and I'll\r\npolish it up later. I'll be back in an hour, if you want to wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir. And the remuneration?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll talk about that later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Biffen left the room. There followed a confused noise,--apparently\r\nfrom his bedroom, in which he seemed to be searching for something.\r\nThen the front door slammed, and quiet descended upon the apartment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington continued to crouch behind her chesterfield. There had\r\nbeen a moment, immediately after the departure of Mr. Biffen, when she\r\nhad half risen with the intention of confronting her traitorous butler\r\nand informing him that he had ceased to be in her employment. But\r\nsecond thoughts had held her back. Gratifying as it would undoubtedly\r\nbe to pop her head up over the back of the sofa and watch the man cower\r\nbeneath her eye, the situation, she realised, was too complicated to\r\npermit such a procedure. She remained where she was, and whiled away\r\nthe time by trying out methods to relieve the cramp from which her\r\nlower limbs had already begun to suffer.\r\n\r\nFrom the direction of the desk came the soft scratching of pen on\r\npaper. Ferris was plainly making quite a job of it, putting all his\r\nenergies into his task. He seemed to be one of those writers, like\r\nFlaubert, who spared no pains in the quest for perfect clarity and are\r\nprepared to correct and re-correct indefinitely till their artist-souls\r\nare satisfied. It seemed to Mrs. Waddington as though her vigil was to\r\ngo on for ever.\r\n\r\nBut in a bustling city like New York it is rarely that the artist\r\nis permitted to concentrate for long without interruption. A\r\ntelephone-bell broke raspingly upon the stillness: and the first\r\nsensation of pleasure which Mrs. Waddington had experienced for a very\r\nlong time came to her as she realised that the instrument was ringing\r\nin the passage outside and not in the room. With something of the wild\r\njoy which reprieved prisoners feel at the announcement of release she\r\nheard the butler rise. And presently there came from a distance his\r\nmeasured voice informing some unseen inquirer that Mr. Biffen was not\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington rose from her form. She had about twenty seconds in\r\nwhich to act, and she wasted none of them. By the time Ferris had\r\nreturned and was once more engrossed in his literary composition, she\r\nwas in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nShe stood by the window, looking out at the fire-escape. Surely by this\r\ntime, she felt, it would be safe to climb once more up to the roof. She\r\ndecided to count three hundred very slowly and risk it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nMolly and Sigsbee Horatio, the latter muttering \"Gallagher! Gallagher!\r\nGallagher!\" to himself in order that the magic name should not again\r\nescape him, had started out in the two-seater about a quarter of an\r\nhour after the departure of Mrs. Waddington's Hispano-Suiza. Half-way\r\nto New York, however, a blow-out had arrested their progress: and the\r\ninability of Sigsbee H. to make a quick job of fixing the spare wheel\r\nhad further delayed them. It was not, therefore, till almost at the\r\nexact moment when Mrs. Waddington was committing the rash act which had\r\nso discomposed Officer Garroway, that Molly, having dropped her father\r\nat Police Headquarters, arrived at the entrance of the Sheridan.\r\n\r\nShe hurried up the stairs and rang George's front-door bell. For awhile\r\nit seemed as if her ringing was to meet with no response: then, after\r\nsome minutes, footsteps made themselves heard coming along the passage.\r\nThe door opened, and Molly found herself gazing into the inflamed eyes\r\nof a policeman.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with surprise. She had never seen him before, and\r\nshe rather felt that she would have preferred not to see him now:\r\nfor he was far from being a pleasing sight. His nose, ears and eyes\r\nwere a vivid red: and his straggling hair dripped wetly on to the\r\nfloor. With the object of diminishing the agony caused by the pepper,\r\nOfficer Garroway had for some time been holding his head under the\r\ntap in the kitchen: and he now looked exactly like the body which had\r\nbeen found after several days in the river. The one small point that\r\ndifferentiated him from a corpse was the fact that he was sneezing.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" exclaimed Molly.\r\n\r\n\"Achoo!\" replied Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Molly.\r\n\r\nThe policeman, with a nobility which should have earned him promotion,\r\nchecked another sneeze.\r\n\r\n\"There has been an outrage,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch has not been hurt?\" cried Molly, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch hasn't. I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Gar-hosh-hoosh-hish.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gar-ish-wash-WUSH ... Garroway,\" said the policeman, becoming calmer.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Mr. Finch?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not say, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a cold?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, miss, not a ker-osh-wosh-osh. A woman threw pepper in my face.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to know such women,\" said Molly severely.\r\n\r\nThe injustice of this stung Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know her socially. I was arresting her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I found her burgling this apartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\"\r\n\r\n\"And when I informed her that I was compelled to take her into custody,\r\nshe threw pepper in my face and escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"You poor man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, miss,\" said Officer Garroway gratefully. A man can do with\r\na bit of sympathy on these occasions, nor is such sympathy rendered\r\nless agreeable by the fact that the one who offers it is young and\r\ncharming and gazes at you with large, melting blue eyes. It was at this\r\npoint that Officer Garroway began for the first time to be aware of a\r\ndistinct improvement in his condition.\r\n\r\n\"Can I get you anything?\" said Molly.\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway shook his head wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"It's against the law, miss, now. In fact, I am to be one of a\r\n_posse_ this very night that is to raid a restaurant which\r\nsupplies the stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant something from a drug-store. Some ointment or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is extremely kind of you, miss, but I could not dream of putting\r\nyou to so much trouble. I will look in at a drug-store on my way to\r\nthe station-house. I fear I must leave you now, as I have to go and\r\ndrish-hosh-hish.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dress, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are dressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the purposes of the raid to which I alluded it is necessary for\r\nour _posse_ to put on full evening drah-woosh. In order to deceive\r\nthe staff of the rish-wish-wosh, and lull them into a false security.\r\nIt would never do, you see, for us to go there in our uniforms. That\r\nwould put them on their guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"How exciting! What restaurant are you raiding?\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Well, miss, it is in the nature of an official secret, of course,\r\nbut on the understanding that you will let it go no further, the\r\nrosh-ow-wush is the Purple Chicken, just round the corner. I will wish\r\nyou good night, miss, as I really must be off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wait a moment. I came here to meet Mr. Finch. Have you seen\r\nanything of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, miss. Nobody has visited the apartment while I have been there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then I'll wait. Good night. I hope you will feel better soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel better already, miss,\" said Officer Garroway gallantly, \"thanks\r\nto your kind sympathy. Good nish-nosh, miss.\"\r\n\r\nMolly went out on to the roof, and stood there gazing over the million\r\ntwinkling lights of the city. At this height the voice of New York sank\r\nto a murmur, and the air was sweet and cool. Little breezes rustled\r\nin the potted shrubs over which Mullett was wont to watch with such\r\nsedulous care, and a half-moon was shining in rather a deprecating way,\r\nas if conscious of not being at its best in such surroundings. For,\r\nlike Sigsbee H. Waddington (now speeding towards his third Gallagher),\r\nthe moon, really to express itself, needs the great open spaces.\r\n\r\nMolly, however, found nothing to criticise in that pale silver glow.\r\nShe felt a proprietary interest in the moon. It was her own private\r\nand personal moon, and should have been shining in through the\r\nwindows of the drawing-room of the train that bore her away on her\r\nwedding-journey. That that journey had been postponed was in no way the\r\nfault of the moon: and, gazing up at it, she tried to convey by her\r\nmanner her appreciation of the fact.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that a strangled exclamation broke the stillness:\r\nand, turning, she perceived George Finch.\r\n\r\nGeorge Finch stood in the moonlight, staring dumbly. Although what he\r\nsaw before him had all the appearance of being Molly, and though a rash\r\nand irreflective observer would no doubt have said that it was Molly,\r\nit was so utterly impossible that she could really be there that he\r\nconcluded that he was suffering from an hallucination. The nervous\r\nstrain of the exacting day through which he had passed had reduced\r\nhim, he perceived, to the condition of those dying travellers in the\r\ndesert who see mirages. And so he remained where he was, not daring to\r\napproach closer: for he knew that if you touch people in dreams they\r\nvanish.\r\n\r\nBut Molly was of a more practical turn of mind. She had come twenty\r\nmiles to see George. She had waited for George for what seemed several\r\nhours. And here George was. She did the sensible thing. Uttering a\r\nlittle squeak of rapture, she ran at him like a rabbit.\r\n\r\n\"Georgie! My pet!\"\r\n\r\nOne lives and learns. George found that he had been all wrong, and\r\nthat his preconceived ideas about dreams and what could and could\r\nnot happen in them must be revised. For, so far from vanishing when\r\ntouched, his wraith appeared to be growing more substantial every\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nHe shut his eyes and kissed her tentatively. He opened his eyes. She\r\nwas still there.\r\n\r\n\"Is it really you?\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, really me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how ... what...?\"\r\n\r\nIt was borne in upon George--for he was a young man of good average\r\nintelligence--that he was spoiling a golden moment with unseasonable\r\nchatter. This was no time for talk. He talked, accordingly, no more;\r\nand there was silence on the roof. The moon looked down, well pleased.\r\nThere is not much of interest for a moon to look at in a large city,\r\nand this was the sort of thing it liked best,--the only sort of thing,\r\nif you came right down to it, that made it worth a moon's while to\r\nshine at all.\r\n\r\nGeorge clung to Molly, and Molly clung to George, like two ship-wrecked\r\nsurvivors who have come together on a wave-swept beach. And the world\r\nmoved on, forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut the world will never allow itself to be forgotten for long.\r\nSuddenly George broke away with an exclamation. He ran to the wall and\r\nlooked over.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge returned, reassured. His concern had been groundless.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I saw some one on the fire-escape, darling.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the fire-escape? Why, who could it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it might be the man who has the apartment on the floor\r\nbelow. A ghastly, sneaking, snooping fellow named Lancelot Biffen. I've\r\nknown him to climb up before. He's the editor of 'Town Gossip,' the\r\nlast person we want to have watching us.\"\r\n\r\nMolly uttered a cry of alarm.\r\n\r\n\"You're sure he wasn't there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be awful if anyone saw me here.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge silently cursed the too vivid imagination which had led him to\r\nsuppose that he had seen a dark form outlined against the summer sky.\r\nHe had spoiled the golden moment, and it could not be recaptured.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, dear,\" he said. \"Even if he had seen you, he would\r\nnever have guessed who you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean he would naturally expect to find you up here kissing some\r\ngirl?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was in the state of mind when a man cannot be quite sure what\r\nhis words mean, if anything: but so positive was he that he did not\r\nmean this that he got his tongue tied in a knot trying to say so in\r\nthree different ways simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, after what happened this afternoon ...\" said Molly.\r\n\r\nShe drew away. She was not normally an unkind girl, but the impulse of\r\nthe female of the species to torture the man it loves is well-known.\r\nWoman may be a ministering angel when pain and anguish rack the brow:\r\nbut, if at other times she sees a chance to prod the loved one and\r\nwatch him squirm, she hates to miss it.\r\n\r\nGeorge's tongue appeared to him to be now in the sort of condition\r\na ball of wool is in after a kitten has been playing with it. With a\r\nsupreme effort he contrived to straighten out a few of the major kinks,\r\njust sufficient to render speech possible.\r\n\r\n\"I swear to you,\" began George, going so far in his emotion as to raise\r\na passionate fist towards the moon.\r\n\r\nMolly gurgled delightedly. She loved this young man most when he looked\r\nfunny: and he had seldom looked funnier than now.\r\n\r\n\"I swear to you on my solemn oath that I had never seen that infernal\r\ngirl before in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"She seemed to know you so well.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a perfect, complete, total, utter and absolute stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure? Perhaps you had simply forgotten all about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear it,\" said George, and only just stopped himself from adding\r\n\"by yonder moon.\" \"If you want to know what I think....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe she was mad. Stark, staring mad.\"\r\n\r\nMolly decided that the anguish had lasted long enough. A girl has to\r\njudge these things to a nicety. Sufficient agony is good for a man,\r\nstimulating his mind and keeping him bright and alert: but too much is\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Georgie!\" she said soothingly. \"You don't really suppose for\r\na moment that I believe a word of what she said, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What! You didn't?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Molly,\" said George, weighing his words, \"you are without exception\r\nthe dearest, sweetest, loveliest, most perfect and angelic thing that\r\never lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Aren't you lucky?\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw at once that the girl was mad, didn't you? You realised\r\nimmediately that she was suffering from some sort of obsession, poor\r\nsoul, which made her....\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't. I couldn't think what it was all about at first, and\r\nthen father came in and said that my pearl necklace had disappeared,\r\nand I understood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your pearl necklace? Disappeared?\"\r\n\r\n\"She stole it. She was a thief. Don't you see? It was really awfully\r\nclever. She couldn't have got it any other way. But when she burst in\r\nand said all those things about you, naturally she took everybody's\r\nattention off the wedding-presents. And then she pretended to faint on\r\nthe table, and just snapped the necklace up and rushed out, and nobody\r\nguessed what had happened.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge drew in a whistling breath. His fists clenched. He stared coldly\r\nat one of the potted shrubs as if it had done him a personal injury.\r\n\r\n\"If ever I meet that girl....\"\r\n\r\nMolly laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Mother still insists that you had known her before and that the\r\nstory she told was true and that she only took the necklace as an\r\nafterthought. Isn't she funny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Funny,\" said George heavily, \"is not the word. She is one long scream\r\nfrom the rise of the curtain, and ought to be beaten over the head with\r\na black-jack. If you want my candid and considered opinion of that\r\nzymotic scourge who has contrived to hook herself on to your family in\r\nthe capacity of stepmother to you and general mischief-maker to the\r\nrest of the world, let me begin by saying.... However, there is no time\r\nto go into that now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there isn't. I must be getting back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I must go home and pack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a suit-case.\"\r\n\r\nThe universe reeled about George.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean you're going away?\" he quavered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. To-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heavens! For long?\"\r\n\r\n\"For ever. With you.\"\r\n\r\n\"With...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. Don't you understand? I'm going home now to pack a\r\nsuit-case. Then I'll drive back to New York and stay the night at an\r\nhotel, and to-morrow we'll be married early in the morning, and in\r\nthe afternoon we'll go off together, all alone, miles and miles from\r\neverybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Molly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at that moon. About now it ought to have been shining into our\r\ndrawing-room on the train.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there will be just as good a moon to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge moistened his lips. Something seemed to be tickling his nose,\r\nand inside his chest a curious growth had begun to swell, rendering\r\nbreathing difficult.\r\n\r\n\"And half an hour ago,\" he said, \"I thought I would never see you\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come down and put me in the car,\" said Molly briskly. \"I left it at\r\nthe door.\"\r\n\r\nThey descended the stairs. Owing to the eccentricity of the elevator,\r\nGeorge had frequently had to go up and down these stairs before: but\r\nit was only now that he noticed for the first time a peculiarity\r\nabout them that made them different from the stairs of every other\r\napartment-house he had visited. They were, he observed, hedged about\r\nwith roses and honeysuckle, and many more birds were singing on them\r\nthan you would expect in an apartment-house. Odd. And yet, as he\r\nimmediately realised, all perfectly in order.\r\n\r\nMolly climbed into the two-seater: and George mentioned a point which\r\nhad presented itself to him.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why you need hurry off like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. I've got to pack and get away before mother gets home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that blas ... is your stepmother in New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She came in to see the police.\"\r\n\r\nUntil this moment George had been looking on New York as something\r\nrather out of the common run of cities--he particularly liked the way\r\nthose violets were sprouting up through the flagstones: but on receipt\r\nof this information he found that it had lost a little of its charm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she's in New York, is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably on her way home by now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think there's time for us to go and have a little dinner\r\nsomewhere? Just a cosy little dinner at some quiet little restaurant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious, no! I'm running it very fine as it is.\" She looked at\r\nhim closely. \"But, Georgie darling, you're starving. I can see it.\r\nYou're quite pale and worn-out. When did you last have anything to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat? Eat? I don't remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do after that business this afternoon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--well, I walked around for awhile. And then I hung about in the\r\nbushes for awhile, hoping you would come out. And then--I believe I\r\nwent to the station and took a train or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You poor darling! Go and eat something at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't I come back to Hempstead with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What hotel will you go to to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. But I'll come and see you for a minute before I go\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, here? You'll come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll come back here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you will go and have some dinner. You look perfectly ghastly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner? All right, I'll have some.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind you do. If you haven't by the time I get back, I'll go straight\r\nhome again and never marry you as long as I live. Good-bye, darling, I\r\nmust be off.\"\r\n\r\nThe two-seater moved away and turned into Washington Square. George\r\nstood looking after it long after there was nothing to look at but\r\nempty street. Then he started off, like some knight of old on a quest\r\ncommanded by his lady, to get the dinner on which she had so strongly\r\ninsisted. She had been wrong, of course, in telling him to go and\r\ndine: for what he wanted to do and what any good doctor would have\r\nrecommended him to do was to return to the roof and gaze at the moon.\r\nBut her lightest wish was law.\r\n\r\nWhere could he go most quickly and get the repulsive task done with the\r\nminimum waste of time?\r\n\r\nThe Purple Chicken. It was just round the corner, and a resolute man if\r\nhe stuck to their _prix fixe_ table-d'hôte at one-dollar-fifty,\r\ncould shovel a meal into himself in about ten minutes--which was not\r\nlong to ask the moon to wait.\r\n\r\nBesides, at the Purple Chicken you could get \"it\" if they knew you.\r\nAnd George, though an abstemious young man, felt that \"it\" was just\r\nwhat at the moment he most required. On an occasion like this he ought,\r\nof course, to sip golden nectar from rare old crystal: but, failing\r\nthat, synthetic whisky served in a coffee-pot was perhaps the next best\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nThe Purple Chicken seemed to be having a big night. The room opening\r\non to the street, when George reached it, was so crowded, that there\r\nwas no chance of getting a table. He passed through, hoping to find a\r\nresting-place in the open-air section which lay beyond: and was struck,\r\nas he walked, by the extraordinarily fine physique of many of the\r\ndiners.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the Purple Chicken catered for the intelligentsia of the\r\nneighbourhood, and these did not run to thews and sinews. On most\r\nnights in the week you would find the tables occupied by wispy poets\r\nand slender futurist painters: but now, though these were present\r\nin great numbers, they were supplemented by quite a sprinkling of\r\ngranite-faced men with knobby shoulders and protruding jaws. George\r\ncame to the conclusion that a convention from one of the outlying\r\nStates must be in town and that these men were members of it, bent upon\r\nseeing Bohemia.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, waste a great deal of time in speculation on this\r\nmatter, for, stirred by the actual presence of food, he had begun now\r\nto realise that Molly had been right, as women always are, and that,\r\nwhile his whole higher self cried out for the moon, his lower self\r\nwas almost equally as insistent on taking in supplies. And at this\r\nparticular restaurant it was happily possible to satisfy both selves\r\nsimultaneously: for there, as he stepped into what the management\r\ncalled the garden--a flagged backyard dotted with tables--was the moon,\r\nall present and correct, and there, also, were waiters waiting to\r\nsupply the _prix fixe_ table-d'hôte at one-dollar-fifty.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to George the neatest possible combination: and his only\r\nanxiety now was with regard to the securing of a seat. At first glance\r\nit appeared that every table was occupied.\r\n\r\nThis conjecture was confirmed by a second glance. But, though all the\r\nother tables had their full quota, there was one, standing beside the\r\nSheridan's back wall and within a few feet of its fire-escape, that\r\nwas in the possession of a single diner. This diner George approached,\r\nmaking his expression as winning as possible. He did not, as a rule,\r\nenjoy sharing a table with a stranger, but as an alternative to going\r\naway and trudging round in search of another restaurant it seemed a\r\ngood plan now.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said George, \"would you mind if I came to this table?\"\r\n\r\nThe other looked up from the _poulet rôti aux pommes de terre_ and\r\n_salade Bruxelloise_ which had been engaging his attention. He\r\nwas plainly one of the convention from the outlying State, if physique\r\ncould be taken as a guide. He spread upwards from the table like a\r\ncircus giant and the hands which gripped the knife and fork had that\r\nsame spaciousness which George had noted in the diners in the other\r\nroom. Only as to the eyes did this man differ from his fellows. They\r\nhad had eyes of a peculiarly steely and unfriendly type, the sort of\r\neyes which a motorist instinctively associates with traffic-policemen\r\nand a professional thief with professional detectives. This man's gaze\r\nwas mild and friendly, and his eyes would have been attractive but for\r\nthe redness of their rims and the generally inflamed look which they\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n\"By no means, sir,\" he replied to George's polite query.\r\n\r\n\"Place very crowded to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Extremely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if you won't mind, I'll sit here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delighted,\" said the other.\r\n\r\nGeorge looked round for a waiter and found one at his elbow. However\r\ncrowded the Purple Chicken might be, its staff never neglected the old\r\nhabitué: and it had had the benefit of George's regular custom for many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, sare,\" said the waiter, smiling the smile which had once\r\nbroken hearts in Assisi.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, Guiseppe,\" said George. \"I'll take the dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sare. Sick or glear zoop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sick. Crowded to-night, Guiseppe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sare. Lots of guys here to-night. Big business.\"\r\n\r\n\"The waiter appears to know you,\" said George's companion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said George, \"I'm in here all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the other, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThe soup arrived, and George set about it with a willing spoon. His\r\ncompanion became hideously involved with spaghetti.\r\n\r\n\"This your first visit to New York?\" asked George, after an interval.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, sir. I live in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thought you were up from the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. I live right here in New York.\"\r\n\r\nA curious idea that he had seen this fellow before somewhere came over\r\nGeorge. Yes, at some time and in some place he could have sworn that he\r\nhad gazed upon that long body, that prominent Adam's apple, and that\r\ngentle expanse of face. He searched his memory. Nothing stirred.\r\n\r\n\"I have an odd feeling that we have met before,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking just the same myself,\" replied the other.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine is Cabot. Delancy Cabot.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember the name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours is curiously familiar. I have heard it before, but cannot think\r\nwhen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you live in Greenwich Village?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somewhat further up-town. And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I live in the apartment on top of this building here at the back of\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden light that seemed that of recognition came into the other's\r\nface. George observed it.\r\n\r\n\"Have you remembered where we met?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. No, indeed,\" said the other hastily. \"It has entirely\r\nescaped me.\" He took a sip of ice water. \"I recall, however, that you\r\nare an artist.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. You are not one, by any chance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a poet.\"\r\n\r\n\"A poet?\" George tried to conceal his somewhat natural surprise. \"Where\r\ndoes your stuff appear mostly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have published nothing as yet, Mr. Finch,\" replied the other sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Tough luck. I have never sold a picture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad.\"\r\n\r\nThey gazed at one another with kindly eyes, two fellow-sufferers from\r\nthe public's lack of taste. Guiseppe appeared, bearing deep-dish\r\napple-pie in one hand, _poulet rôti_ in the other.\r\n\r\n\"Guiseppe,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Sare?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge bent his lips towards the waiter's attentive ear.\r\n\r\n\"Bzz ... Bzz ... Bzz ...\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sare. Very good, sare. In one moment, sare.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge leaned back contentedly. Then it occurred to him that he had\r\nbeen a little remiss. He was not actually this red-eyed man's host, but\r\nthey had fraternised and they both knew what it was to toil at their\r\nrespective arts without encouragement or appreciation.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you will join me?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Join you, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a high-ball. Guiseppe has gone to get me one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? Is it possible to obtain alcoholic refreshment in this\r\nrestaurant?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can always get it if they know you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely it is against the law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed George. He liked this pleasant, whimsical fellow.\r\n\"Ha, ha! Deuced good!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at him with that genial bonhomie with which one looks at\r\na stranger in whom one has discovered a sly sense of humour. And,\r\nlooking, he suddenly congealed.\r\n\r\nStranger?\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" ejaculated George.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, nothing.\"\r\n\r\nMemory, though loitering by the way, had reached its goal at last.\r\nThis man was no stranger. George recollected now where he had seen\r\nhim before--on the roof of the Sheridan, when the other, clad in\r\npoliceman's uniform, had warned him of the deplorable past of Frederick\r\nMullett. The man was a cop, and under his very eyes, red rims and all,\r\nhe had just ordered a high-ball.\r\n\r\nGeorge gave a feverish laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I was only kidding, of course,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Kidding, Mr. Finch?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I said that you could get it here. You can't, of course. What\r\nGuiseppe is bringing me is ginger-ale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"And my name isn't Finch,\" babbled George. \"It--it is--er--Briskett.\r\nAnd I don't live in that apartment up there, I live in....\"\r\n\r\nHe was aware of Guiseppe at his side. And Guiseppe was being\r\nunspeakably furtive and conspiratorial with a long glass and a\r\ncoffee-pot. He looked like one of the executive staff of the Black\r\nHand plotting against the public weal.\r\n\r\n\"Is that my ginger-ale?\" twittered George. \"My ginger-ale, is that what\r\nyou've got there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sare. Your ginger-ale. Your ginger-ale, Mr. Feench, ha, ha, ha!\r\nYou are vairy fonny gentleman,\" said Guiseppe approvingly.\r\n\r\nGeorge could have kicked the man. If this was what the modern Italian\r\nwas like, no wonder the country had had to have a dictatorship.\r\n\r\n\"Take it away,\" he said, quivering. \"I don't want it in a coffee-pot.\"\r\n\r\n\"We always sairve the whisky in the coffee-pot, Mr. Feench. You know\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the table George was appalled by a sinister sight. The man\r\nopposite was rising. Yards and yards of him were beginning to uncoil,\r\nand on his face there was a strange look of determination and menace.\r\n\r\n\"You're....\"\r\n\r\nGeorge knew what the next word would have been. It would have been\r\nthe verb \"pinched.\" But it was never uttered. With a sudden frenzy,\r\nGeorge Finch acted. He was not normally a man of violence, but there\r\nare occasions when violence and nothing but violence will meet the\r\ncase. There flashed through his mind a vision of what would be, did he\r\nnot act with promptitude and despatch. He would be arrested, haled to\r\njail, immured in a dungeon-cell. And Molly would come back and find no\r\none there to welcome her and--what was even worse--no one to marry her\r\non the morrow.\r\n\r\nGeorge did not hesitate. Seizing the table-cloth, he swept it off in\r\na hideous whirl of apple-pie, ice water, bread, potatoes, salad and\r\n_poulet rôti_. He raised it on high, like a _retarius_ in the\r\narena, and brought it down in an enveloping mass on the policeman's\r\nhead. Interested cries arose on all sides. The Purple Chicken was\r\none of those jolly, informal restaurants in which a spirit of clean\r\nBohemian fun is the prevailing note, but even in the Purple Chicken\r\noccurrences like this were unusual and calculated to excite remark.\r\nFour diners laughed happily, a fifth exclaimed \"Hot pazazas!\" and a\r\nsixth said \"Well, would you look at that!\"\r\n\r\nThe New York police are not quitters. They may be down, but they are\r\nnever out. A clutching hand emerged from the table-cloth and gripped\r\nGeorge's shoulder. Another clutching hand was groping about not far\r\nfrom his collar. The fingers of the first hand fastened their hold.\r\n\r\nGeorge was not in the frame of mind to be tolerant of this sort of\r\nthing. He hit out and smote something solid.\r\n\r\n\"Casta dimura salve e pura! 'At-a-boy! Soak him again,\" said Guiseppe,\r\nthe waiter, convinced now that the man in the table-cloth was one who\r\nhad not the best interests of the Purple Chicken at heart.\r\n\r\nGeorge did so. The table-cloth became still more agitated. The hand\r\nfell from his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a confused noise of shouting from the inner\r\nroom, and all the lights went out.\r\n\r\nGeorge would not have had it otherwise. Darkness just suited him. He\r\nleaped for the fire-escape and climbed up it with as great a celerity\r\nas Mrs. Waddington, some little time before, had used in climbing\r\ndown. He reached the roof and paused for an instant, listening to\r\nthe tumult below. Then, hearing through the din the sound of somebody\r\nclimbing, he ran to the sleeping-porch and dived beneath the bed. To\r\nseek refuge in his apartment was, he realised, useless. That would be\r\nthe first place the pursuer would draw.\r\n\r\nHe lay there, breathless. Footsteps came to the door. The door opened,\r\nand the light was switched on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nIn supposing that the person or persons whom he had heard climbing\r\nup the fire-escape were in pursuit of himself, George Finch had made\r\na pardonable error. Various circumstances had combined to render his\r\ndeparture from the Purple Chicken unobserved.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, just as Officer Garroway was on the point of\r\nreleasing his head from the folds of the table-cloth, Guiseppe, with a\r\nloyalty to his employers which it would be difficult to over-praise,\r\nhit him in the eye with the coffee-pot. This had once more confused the\r\npoliceman's outlook, and by the time he was able to think clearly again\r\nthe lights went out.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously the moon, naturally on George's side and anxious to do\r\nall that it could to help, went behind a thick cloud and stayed there.\r\nNo human eye, therefore, had witnessed the young man's climb for life.\r\n\r\nThe persons whom he had heard on the fire-escape were a couple who,\r\nlike himself, had no object in mind other than a swift removal of\r\nthemselves from the danger-zone. And so far were they from being\r\nhostile to George that each, had they seen him, would have urged him on\r\nand wished him luck. For one of them was Madame Eulalie and the other\r\nno less a man than J. Hamilton Beamish in person.\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish, escorting his bride-to-be, had arrived at the Purple\r\nChicken a few minutes after George, and, like George, had found the\r\nplace crowded to its last table. But unlike George, he had not meekly\r\naccepted this situation as unalterable. Exerting the full force of\r\nhis majestic personality, he had caused an extra table to appear, to\r\nbe set, and to be placed in the fairway at the spot where the indoor\r\nrestaurant joined the outdoor annex.\r\n\r\nIt was a position which at first had seemed to have drawbacks. The\r\nwaiters who passed at frequent intervals were compelled to bump into\r\nMr. Beamish's chair, which is always unpleasant when one is trying\r\nto talk to the girl one loves. But the time was to arrive when its\r\ndrawbacks were lost sight of in the contemplation of its strategic\r\nadvantages. At the moment when the raid may be said to have formally\r\nopened, Hamilton Beamish was helping the girl of his heart to what the\r\nmanagement had assured him was champagne. He was interrupted in this\r\nkindly action by a large hand placed heavily on his shoulder and a\r\ngruff voice which informed him that he was under arrest.\r\n\r\nWhether Hamilton Beamish would have pursued George Finch's spirited\r\npolicy of enveloping the man in the table-cloth and thereafter plugging\r\nhim in the eye, will never be known: for the necessity for such a\r\nprocedure was removed by the sudden extinction of the lights: and it\r\nwas at this point that the advantage of being in that particular spot\r\nbecame apparent.\r\n\r\nFrom the table to the fire-escape was but a few steps: and Hamilton\r\nBeamish, seizing his fiancée by the hand, dragged her thither and,\r\nplacing her foot on the lowest step, gave her an upward boost which\r\nleft no room for misapprehension. A moment later, Madame Eulalie was\r\nhurrying roofwards, with Hamilton Beamish in close attendance.\r\n\r\nThey stood together at the end of their journey, looking down. The\r\nlights of the Purple Chicken were still out, and from the darkness\r\nthere rose a confused noise indicative of certain persons unknown being\r\nrather rough with certain other persons unknown. It seemed to Madame\r\nEulalie that she and her mate were well out of it, and she said so.\r\n\r\n\"I never realised before what a splendid man you were to have by one in\r\nan emergency, Jimmy dear,\" she said. \"Anything slicker than the way you\r\nscooped us out of that place I never saw. You must have had lots and\r\nlots of practice.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish was passing a handkerchief over his dome-like\r\nforehead. The night was warm, and the going had been fast.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forgive myself,\" he said, \"for exposing you to such an\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I enjoyed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all has ended well, thank goodness....\"\r\n\r\n\"But has it?\" interrupted Madame Eulalie.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed downwards.\r\n\r\n\"There's somebody coming up!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do? Go out by the stairs?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"In all probability they will be guarding the entrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what?\"\r\n\r\nIt is at moments like these that the big brain really tells. An\r\nordinary man might have been non-plussed. Certainly, he would have had\r\nto waste priceless moments in thought. Hamilton Beamish, with one flash\r\nof his giant mind, had the problem neatly solved in four and a quarter\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nHe took his bride-to-be by the arm and turned her round.\r\n\r\n\"Look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which?\"\r\n\r\n\"That.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Bewilderment was limned upon the girl's fair face. \"I don't\r\nunderstand. What do you want me to specially look at?\"\r\n\r\n\"At what do you want me especially to look,\" corrected Hamilton Beamish\r\nmechanically. He drew her across the roof. \"You see that summer-house\r\nthing? It is George Finch's open-air sleeping-porch. Go in, shut the\r\ndoor, switch on the light....\"\r\n\r\n\"But....\"\r\n\r\n\"... and remove a portion of your clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if anybody comes tell him that George Finch rented you the\r\napartment and that you are dressing to go out to dinner. I, meanwhile,\r\nwill go down to my apartment and will come up in a few minutes to\r\nsee if you are ready to be taken out to dine.\" Pardonable pride so\r\novercame Hamilton Beamish that he discarded the English Pure and\r\nrelapsed into the argot of the proletariat. \"Is that a cracker-jack?\"\r\nhe demanded with gleaming eyes. \"Is that a wam? Am I the bozo with the\r\nbig bean or am I not?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl eyed him worshippingly. One of the consolations which we men\r\nof intellect have is that, when things come to a crisis, what captures\r\nthe female heart is brains. Women may permit themselves in times of\r\npeace to stray after Sheiks and look languishingly at lizards whose\r\nonly claim to admiration is that they can do the first three steps\r\nof the Charleston: but let matters go wrong; let some sudden peril\r\nthreaten; and who then is the king pippin, who the main squeeze? The\r\nman with the eight and a quarter hat.\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy,\" she cried, \"it's the goods!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a life-saver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. Be quick, then. There is no time to waste.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that George Finch, nestling beneath the bed,\r\nreceived a shock which, inured though he should have been to shocks by\r\nnow, seemed to him to turn every hair on his head instantaneously grey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nThe first thing that impressed itself on George Finch's consciousness,\r\nafter his eyes had grown accustomed to the light, was an ankle. It\r\nwas clad in a stocking of diaphanous silk, and was joined almost\r\nimmediately by another ankle, similarly clad. For an appreciable time\r\nthese ankles, though slender, bulked so large in George's world\r\nthat they may be said to have filled his whole horizon. Then they\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nA moment before this happened, George, shrinking modestly against the\r\nwall, would have said that nothing could have pleased him better than\r\nto have these ankles disappear. Nevertheless, when they did so, it was\r\nall he could do to keep himself from uttering a stricken cry. For the\r\nreason they disappeared was that at this moment a dress of some filmy\r\nmaterial fell over them, hiding them from view.\r\n\r\nIt was a dress that had the appearance of having been cut by fairy\r\nscissors out of moon-beams and star-dust: and in a shop-window George\r\nwould have admired it. But seeing it in a shop-window and seeing it\r\nbunched like a prismatic foam on the floor of this bedroom were two\r\nseparate and distinct things: and so warmly did George Finch blush that\r\nhe felt as if his face must be singeing the carpet. He shut his eyes\r\nand clenched his teeth. Was this, he asked himself, the end or but a\r\nbeginning?\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said a voice suddenly. And George's head, jerking convulsively,\r\nseemed for an instant to have parted company with a loosely-attached\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nThe voice had spoken, he divined as soon as the power of thought\r\nreturned to him, in response to a sharp and authoritative knock on\r\nthe door, delivered by some hard instrument which sounded like a\r\npoliceman's night-stick: and there followed immediately upon this knock\r\nsharp and authoritative words.\r\n\r\n\"Open up there!\"\r\n\r\nThe possessor of the ankles was plainly a girl of spirit.\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" she said. \"I'm dressing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are _you_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind who I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, never mind who _I_ am, then!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. It seemed to George, judging the matter\r\ndispassionately, that the ankles had had slightly the better of the\r\nexchanges to date.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing in there?\" asked the male duettist, approaching the\r\nthing from another angle.\r\n\r\n\"I'm dressing, I keep telling you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. And then into this tense debate there entered\r\na third party.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this?\" said the new-comer sharply.\r\n\r\nGeorge recognised the voice of his old friend Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"Garroway,\" said Hamilton Beamish, with an annoyed severity, \"what the\r\ndevil are you doing, hanging about outside this lady's door? Upon my\r\nsoul,\" proceeded Mr. Beamish warmly, \"I'm beginning to wonder what the\r\nduties of the New York constabulary are. Their life seems to consist\r\nof an endless leisure, which they employ in roaming about and annoying\r\nwomen. Are you aware that the lady inside there is my fiancée and that\r\nshe is dressing in order to dine with me at a restaurant?\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway, as always, cringed before the superior intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"I am extremely sorry, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you ought to be. What are you doing here, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"There has been some little trouble down below on the premises of the\r\nPurple Chicken, and I was violently assaulted by Mr. Finch. I followed\r\nhim up here on the fire-escape....\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Finch? You are drivelling, Garroway. Mr. Finch is on his\r\nwedding-trip. He very kindly lent this lady his apartment during his\r\nabsence.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Beamish, I was talking to him only just now. We sat at the\r\nsame table.\"\r\n\r\n\"Absurd!\"\r\n\r\nThe dress had disappeared from George's range of vision now, and he\r\nheard the door open.\r\n\r\n\"What does this man want, Jimmy?\"\r\n\r\n\"A doctor, apparently,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"He says he met George\r\nFinch just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But George is miles away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. Are you ready, darling? Then we will go off and have some\r\ndinner. What you need, Garroway, is a bromo-seltzer. Come down to my\r\napartment and I will mix you one. Having taken it, I would recommend\r\nyou to lie down quietly on the sofa and rest awhile. I think you must\r\nhave been over-exercising your brain, writing that poem of yours. Who\r\nblacked your eye?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I knew,\" said Officer Garroway wistfully. \"I received the\r\ninjury during the fracas at the Purple Chicken. There was a table-cloth\r\nover my head at the moment, and I was unable to ascertain the identity\r\nof my assailant. If, and when, I find him I shall soak him so hard\r\nit'll jar his grandchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\"A table-cloth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Beamish. And while I was endeavouring to extricate myself\r\nfrom its folds, somebody hit me in the eye with a coffee-pot.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it was a coffee-pot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I found it lying beside me when I emerged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Well,\" said Hamilton Beamish, summing up, \"I hope that this will\r\nbe a lesson to you not to go into places like the Purple Chicken. You\r\nare lucky to have escaped so lightly. You might have had to eat their\r\ncheese. Well, come along, Garroway, and we will see what we can do for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nGeorge stayed where he was. If he had known of a better 'ole, he would\r\nhave gone to it: but he did not. He would have been the last person to\r\npretend that it was comfortable lying underneath this bed with fluff\r\ntickling his nose and a draught playing about his left ear: but there\r\nseemed in the circumstances nothing else to do. To a man unable to fly\r\nthere were only two modes of exit from this roof,--he could climb down\r\nthe fire-escape, probably into the very arms of the constabulary, or\r\nhe could try to sneak down the stairs, and most likely run straight\r\ninto the vengeful Garroway. True, Hamilton Beamish had recommended the\r\npoliceman after drinking his bromo-seltzer to lie down on the sofa,\r\nbut who knew if he would follow the advice? Possibly he was even now\r\npatrolling the staircase: and George, recalling the man's physique\r\nand remembering the bitterness with which he had spoken of his late\r\nassailant, decided that the risk was too great to be taken. Numerous as\r\nwere the defects of his little niche beneath the bed, considered as a\r\nspot to spend a happy evening, it was a good place to be for a man in\r\nhis delicate position. So he dug himself in and tried to while away the\r\ntime by thinking.\r\n\r\nHe thought of many things. He thought of his youth in East Gilead, of\r\nhis manhood in New York. He thought of Molly and how much he loved\r\nher; of Mrs. Waddington and what a blot she was on the great scheme\r\nof things; of Hamilton Beamish and his off-hand way of dealing with\r\npolicemen. He thought of Officer Garroway and his night-stick; of\r\nGuiseppe and his coffee-pot; of the Reverend Gideon Voules and his\r\nwhite socks. He even thought of Sigsbee H. Waddington.\r\n\r\nNow, when a man is so hard put to it for mental occupation that he has\r\nto fall back on Sigsbee H. Waddington as a topic of thought, he is\r\nnearing the end of his resources: and it was possibly with a kindly\r\nappreciation of this fact that Fate now supplied something else to\r\noccupy George's mind. Musing idly on Sigsbee H. and wondering how he\r\ngot that way, George became suddenly aware of approaching footsteps.\r\n\r\nHe curled himself up into a ball, and his ears stood straight up like\r\na greyhound's. Yes, footsteps. And, what was more, they seemed to be\r\nmaking straight for the sleeping-porch.\r\n\r\nA wave of self-pity flooded over George Finch. Why should he be so\r\nill-used? He asked so little of Life,--merely to be allowed to lie\r\nquietly under a bed and inhale fluff: and what happened? Nothing but\r\ninterruptions. Nothing but boots, boots, boots, boots, marching up and\r\ndown again, as Kipling has so well put it. Ever since he had found his\r\npresent hiding-place, the world had seemed to become one grey inferno\r\nof footsteps. It was wrong and unjust.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that could possibly be said in extenuation of the\r\npresent footsteps was that they sounded too light to be those of any\r\nNew York policeman. They had approached now to the very door. Indeed,\r\nthey seemed to him to have stopped actually inside the room.\r\n\r\nHe was right in this conjecture. The switch clicked. Light jumped at\r\nhim like a living thing. And when he opened his eyes he found himself\r\nlooking at a pair of ankles clad in stockings of diaphanous silk.\r\n\r\nThe door closed. And Mrs. Waddington, who had just reached the top of\r\nthe fire-escape, charged across the roof and, putting her ear to the\r\nkeyhole, stood listening intently. Things, felt Mrs. Waddington, were\r\nbeginning to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\nFor a moment, all that George Finch felt as he glared out at this\r\nlatest visitation was a weak resentment at the oafishness of Fate in\r\nusing the same method for his tormenting that it had used so short a\r\nwhile before. Fate, he considered, was behaving childishly, and ought\r\nto change its act. This ankle business might have been funny enough\r\nonce: but, overdone, it became tedious.\r\n\r\nThen to indignation there succeeded relief. The remarks of Hamilton\r\nBeamish in his conversation with the policeman had made it clear that\r\nthe possessor of the ankles had been his old friend May Stubbs of\r\nEast Gilead, Idaho: and, seeing ankles once again, George naturally\r\nassumed that they were attached, as before, to Miss Stubbs, and\r\nthat the reason for her return was that she had come back to fetch\r\nsomething--some powder-puff, for example, or a lipstick--which in the\r\nexcitement of the recent altercation she had forgotten to take along\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, altered the whole position of affairs. What it\r\namounted to was that, instead of a new enemy he had found an ally. A\r\nbroad-minded girl like May would understand at once the motives which\r\nhad led him to hide under the bed and would sympathise with them.\r\nHe could employ her, it occurred to him, as a scout, to see if the\r\nstaircase was not clear. In short, this latest interruption of his\r\nreverie, so far from being a disaster, was the very best thing that\r\ncould have happened.\r\n\r\nSneezing heartily, for he had got a piece of fluff up his nose, George\r\nrolled out from under the bed: and, scrambling to his feet with a\r\njolly laugh, found himself gazing into the bulging eyes of a complete\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThat, at least, was how the girl impressed him in the first instant of\r\ntheir meeting. But gradually, as he stared at her, there crept into his\r\nmind the belief that somewhere and at some time he had seen her before.\r\nBut where? And when?\r\n\r\nThe girl continued to gape at him. She was small and pretty, with vivid\r\nblack eyes and a mouth which, if it had not been hanging open at the\r\nmoment like that of a fish, would have been remarkably attractive.\r\nSilence reigned in the sleeping-porch: and Mrs. Waddington, straining\r\nher ears outside, was beginning to think that George could not be\r\nin this lair and that a further vigil was before her, when suddenly\r\nvoices began to speak. What they were saying, she was unable to hear,\r\nfor the door was stoutly built: but beyond a doubt one of them was\r\nGeorge's. Mrs. Waddington crept away, well content. Her suspicions had\r\nbeen confirmed, and now it remained only to decide what it was best to\r\ndo about it. She moved into the shadow of the water-tank, and there\r\nremained for a space in deep thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInside the sleeping-porch, the girl, her eyes fixed on George, had\r\nbegun to shrink back. At about the third shrink she bumped into the\r\nwall, and the shock seemed to restore her power of speech.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing in my bedroom?\" she cried.\r\n\r\nThe question had the effect of substituting for the embarrassment\r\nwhich had been gripping George a sudden bubbling fury. This, he felt,\r\nwas too much. Circumstances had conspired that night to turn this\r\nsleeping-porch into a sort of meeting-place of the nations, but he was\r\ndarned if he was going to have his visitors looking on the room as\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, your bedroom?\" he demanded hotly. \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm Mrs. Mullett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Frederick Mullett.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington had formed her plan of action. What she needed, she\r\nperceived, was a witness to come with her to this den of evil and add\r\nhis testimony in support of hers. If only Lord Hunstanton had been\r\npresent, as he should have been, she would have needed to look no\r\nfurther. But Lord Hunstanton was somewhere out in the great city,\r\nfilling his ignoble tummy with food. Whom, then, could she enroll as a\r\ndeputy? The question answered itself. Ferris was the man. He was ready\r\nto hand and could be fetched without delay.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington made for the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Mullett?\" said George. \"What do you mean? Mullett's not married.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is. We were married this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I left him down below, finishing a cigar. He said we'd be all alone up\r\nhere, nesting like two little birds in a tree top.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge laughed a brassy, sardonic laugh.\r\n\r\n\"If Mullett thought anyone could ever be alone for five minutes up\r\nhere, he's an optimist. And what right has Mullett to go nesting like a\r\nlittle bird in my apartment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this your apartment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop it! Don't make that noise. There are policemen about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Policemen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nTears suddenly filled the eyes that looked into his. Two small hands\r\nclasped themselves in a passionate gesture of appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Don't turn me over to the bulls, mister! I only did it for ma's sake.\r\nIf you was out of work and starvin' and you had to sit and watch your\r\npoor old ma bendin' over the wash-tub....\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't got a poor old ma,\" said George curtly. \"And what on earth\r\ndo you think you're talking about?\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly, speech wiped from his lips by a stunning\r\ndiscovery. The girl had unclasped her hands, and now she flung them\r\nout before her: and the gesture was all that George's memory needed to\r\nspur it to the highest efficiency. For unconsciously Fanny Mullett had\r\nassumed the exact attitude which had lent such dramatic force to her\r\nentrance into the dining-room of Mrs. Waddington's house at Hempstead\r\nearlier in the day. The moment he saw those out-stretched arms,\r\nGeorge remembered where he had met this girl before: and, forgetting\r\neverything else, forgetting that he was trapped on a roof with a justly\r\nexasperated policeman guarding the only convenient exit, he uttered a\r\nshort, sharp bark of exultation.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" he cried. \"Give me that necklace.\"\r\n\r\n\"What necklace?\"\r\n\r\n\"The one you stole at Hempstead this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl drew herself up haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"Do you dare to say I stole a necklace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh? And do you know what I'll do if you bring a charge like that\r\nagainst me! I'll....\"\r\n\r\nShe broke off. A discreet tap had sounded on the door.\r\n\r\n\"Honey!\"\r\n\r\nFanny looked at George. George looked at Fanny.\r\n\r\n\"My husband!\" whispered Fanny.\r\n\r\nGeorge was in no mood to be intimidated by a mere Mullett. He strode to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"Honey!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge flung the door open.\r\n\r\n\"Honey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mullett?\"\r\n\r\nThe valet fell back a pace, his eyes widening. He passed the tip of his\r\ntongue over his lips.\r\n\r\n\"A wasp in the beehive!\" cried Mullett.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be an idiot,\" said George.\r\n\r\nMullett was gazing at him in the manner of one stricken to the core.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't your own bridal-trip enough for you, Mr. Finch,\" he said\r\nreproachfully, \"that you've got to come butting in on mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool. My wedding was temporarily postponed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. And misery loves company, so you start in breaking up my home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had known that you were on the premises, Mr. Finch,\" said Mullett\r\nwith dignity, \"I would not have taken the liberty of making use of your\r\ndomicile. Come, Fanny, we will go to a hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you?\" said George unpleasantly. \"Let me tell you there's a little\r\nmatter to be settled before you start going to any hotel. Perhaps you\r\nare not aware that your wife is in possession of a valuable necklace\r\nbelonging to the lady who, if it hadn't been for her, would now be Mrs.\r\nGeorge Finch?\"\r\n\r\nMullett clapped a hand to his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"A necklace!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie,\" cried his bride.\r\n\r\nMullett shook his head sadly. He was putting two and two together.\r\n\r\n\"When did this occur, Mr. Finch?\"\r\n\r\n\"This afternoon, down at Hempstead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you listen to him, Freddy. He's dippy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What precisely happened, Mr. Finch?\"\r\n\r\n\"This woman suddenly burst into the room where everybody was and\r\npretended that I had made love to her and deserted her. Then she fell\r\non the table where the wedding-presents were and pretended to faint.\r\nAnd then she dashed out, and some time afterwards it was discovered\r\nthat the necklace was gone. And don't,\" he added, turning to the\r\naccused, \"say that you only did it for your poor old ma's sake, because\r\nI've had a lot to put up with to-day, and that will be just too much.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mullett clicked his tongue with a sort of sorrowful pride. Girls\r\nwill be girls, Frederick Mullett seemed to say, but how few girls could\r\nbe as clever as his little wife.\r\n\r\n\"Give Mr. Finch his necklace, pettie,\" he said mildly.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't got any necklace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give it to him, dearie, just like Freddie says, or there'll only be\r\nunpleasantness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unpleasantness,\" said George, breathing hard, \"is right!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a beautiful bit of work, honey, and there isn't another girl in\r\nNew York that could have thought it out, let alone gone and got away\r\nwith it. Even Mr. Finch will admit it was a beautiful bit of work.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want Mr. Finch's opinion ...\" began George heatedly.\r\n\r\n\"But we've done with all that sort of thing now, haven't we, pettie?\r\nGive him his necklace, honey.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Mullett's black eyes snapped. She twisted her pretty fingers\r\nirresolutely.\r\n\r\n\"Take your old necklace,\" she said.\r\n\r\nGeorge caught it as it fell.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said, and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Mr. Finch,\" said Mullett suavely, \"I think we will say good\r\nnight. My little girl here has had a tiring day and ought to be turning\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge hurried across the roof to his apartment. Whatever the risk\r\nof leaving the safety of the sleeping-porch, it must be ignored. It\r\nwas imperative that he telephone to Molly and inform her of what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nHe was pulling the French window open when he heard his name called:\r\nand perceived Mullett hurrying towards him from the door that led to\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Just one moment, Mr. Finch.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it? I have a most important telephone-call to make.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would be glad to have this, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWith something of the air of a conjurer who, to amuse the children,\r\nproduces two rabbits and the grand old flag from inside a borrowed\r\ntop-hat, Mullett unclasped his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Your necklace, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge's hand flew to his pocket and came away empty.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens! How...?\"\r\n\r\n\"My little girl,\" explained Mullett with a proud and tender look in his\r\neyes. \"She snitched it off you, sir, as we were going out. I was able,\r\nhowever, to persuade her to give it up again. I reminded her that we\r\nhad put all that sort of thing behind us now. I asked her how she could\r\nexpect to be happy on our duck-farm if she had a thing like that on her\r\nmind, and she saw it almost at once. She's a very reasonable girl, sir,\r\nwhen tactfully approached by the voice of love.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge drew a deep breath. He replaced the necklace in his inside\r\nbreast-pocket, buttoned his coat and drew away a step or two.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to let that woman loose on a duck-farm, Mullett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. We are taking a little place in the neighbourhood of Speonk.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll have the tail-feathers off every bird on the premises before\r\nthe end of the first week.\"\r\n\r\nMullett bowed his appreciation of the compliment.\r\n\r\n\"And they wouldn't know they'd lost them, sir,\" he agreed. \"There's\r\nnever been anyone in the profession fit to be reckoned in the same\r\nclass with my little girl. But all that sort of thing is over now, sir.\r\nShe is definitely retiring from business,--except for an occasional\r\nvisit to the department stores during bargain-sales. A girl must have\r\nher bit of finery. Good night, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" said George.\r\n\r\nHe took out the necklace, examined it carefully, replaced it in his\r\npocket, buttoned his coat once more, and went into the apartment to\r\ntelephone to Molly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington had once read a story in which a series of emotions\r\nincluding fear, horror, amazement, consternation and a sickly\r\ndismay were described as \"chasing one another\" across the face of a\r\ndastardly person at the moment of realisation that his villainy had\r\nbeen discovered past concealment: and it was with the expectation of\r\nwatching a similar parade on the moon-like countenance of Ferris, the\r\nbutler, that she pressed the bell outside the door of the apartment of\r\nMr. Lancelot Biffen on the ninth floor.\r\n\r\nShe was disappointed. Ferris, as he appeared in the doorway in answer\r\nto her ring, lacked a little of his customary portentous dignity,\r\nbut that was only because we authors, after a gruelling bout at the\r\ndesk, are always apt to look a shade frazzled. The butler's hair was\r\ndisordered where he had plucked at it in the agony of composition, and\r\nthere was more ink on the tip of his nose than would have been there on\r\na more formal occasion: but otherwise he was in pretty good shape, and\r\nhe did not even start on perceiving the identity of his visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Biffen is not at home, madam,\" said Ferris equably.\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to see Mr. Biffen.\" Mrs. Waddington swelled with\r\njustifiable wrath. \"Ferris,\" she said, \"I know all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no sick relative,\" proceeded Mrs. Waddington, though her tone\r\nsuggested the opinion that anyone related to him had good reason to\r\nbe sick. \"You are here because you are writing a scurrilous report of\r\nwhat happened this afternoon at my house for a gutter rag called 'Town\r\nGossip.'\"\r\n\r\n\"With which is incorporated 'Broadway Whispers' and 'Times Square\r\nTattle,'\" murmured the butler, absently.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\"\r\n\r\nFerris raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"I venture to take issue with you, madam. The profession of journalism\r\nis an honourable one. Many very estimable men have written for the\r\nPress. Horace Greeley,\" said Ferris, specifying. \"Delane....\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we will go into that later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, I wish you to accompany me to the roof....\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear I must respectfully decline, madam. I have not climbed since I\r\nwas a small lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can walk up a flight of stairs, can't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stairs? Decidedly, madam. I will be at your disposal in a few\r\nmoments.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to accompany me now.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"If I might excuse myself, madam. I am engaged on the concluding\r\npassages of the article to which you alluded just now, and I am anxious\r\nto complete it before Mr. Biffen's return.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington caused the eye before which Sigsbee H. had so often\r\ncurled up and crackled like a burnt feather to blaze imperiously upon\r\nthe butler. He met it with the easy aplomb of one who in his time has\r\nlooked at dukes and made them feel that their trousers were bagging at\r\nthe knees.\r\n\r\n\"Would you care to step inside and wait, madam?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington was reluctantly obliged to realise that she was\r\nquelled. She had shot her bolt. A cyclone might shake this man, but not\r\nthe human eye.\r\n\r\n\"I will not step inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam. For what reason do you desire me to accompany you to\r\nthe roof?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to--to look at something.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is the view, madam, I should mention that I have already visited\r\nthe top of the Woolworth Building.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the view. I wish you to look at a man who is living in open\r\nsin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam.\" There was no surprise in Ferris's manner, only a\r\ncourteous suggestion that he was always glad to look at men living in\r\nopen sin. \"I will be at your disposal in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed the door gently, and Mrs. Waddington, full of the coward rage\r\nwhich dares to burn but does not dare to blaze, abandoned her intention\r\nof kicking in a panel and stood on the landing, heaving gently. And\r\npresently there was borne up to her from the lower levels a cheerful\r\nsound of whistling.\r\n\r\nLord Hunstanton came into view.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo-ullo-ullo!\" said Lord Hunstanton exuberantly. \"Here I am, here I\r\nam, here I am!\"--meaning, of course, that there he was.\r\n\r\nA striking change had taken place in the man's appearance since Mrs.\r\nWaddington had last seen him. He now wore the care-free and debonair\r\nexpression of one who has dined and dined well. The sparkle in his eye\r\nspoke of clear soup, the smile on his lips was eloquent of roast duck\r\nand green peas. To Mrs. Waddington, who had not broken bread since\r\nlunch-time, he seemed the most repellant object on which she had ever\r\ngazed.\r\n\r\n\"I trust you have had a good dinner,\" she said icily.\r\n\r\nHis lordship's sunny smile broadened, and a dreamy look came into his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely!\" he replied. \"I started with a spruce spoonful of Julienne\r\nand passed on by way of a breezy half-lobster on the shell to about as\r\nupstanding a young Long Island duckling as I have ever bitten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet!\" said Mrs. Waddington, shaken to the core. The man's\r\nconversation seemed to her utterly revolting.\r\n\r\n\"Finishing up with....\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be quiet! I have no desire to hear the details of your\r\nrepast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sorry! I thought you had.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been away long enough to have eaten half-a-dozen dinners.\r\nHowever, as it happens, you are not too late. I have something to show\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good. Moral turpitude pretty strong on the wing, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few moments ago,\" said Mrs. Waddington, leading the way to the roof,\r\n\"I observed a young woman enter what appears to be some kind of outdoor\r\nsleeping-porch attached to George Finch's apartment, and immediately\r\nafterwards I heard her voice in conversation with George Finch within.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turpy,\" said his lordship, shaking his head reprovingly. \"Very turpy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came down to fetch Ferris, my butler, as a witness, but fortunately\r\nyou have returned in time. Though why you were not back half an hour\r\nago I cannot understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I was telling you. I dallied with a mouthful of Julienne....\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet!\"\r\n\r\nLord Hunstanton followed her, puzzled. He could not understand what\r\nseemed to him a morbid distaste on his companion's part to touch on\r\nthe topic of food. They came out on the roof, and Mrs. Waddington,\r\nraising a silent and beckoning finger, moved on tip-toe towards the\r\nsleeping-porch.\r\n\r\n\"Now what?\" inquired his lordship, as they paused before the door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington rapped upon the panel.\r\n\r\n\"George Finch!\"\r\n\r\nComplete silence followed the words.\r\n\r\n\"George Finch!\"\r\n\r\n\"George Finch!\" echoed his lordship, conscious of his responsibilities\r\nas a chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Finch!\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"George!\" cried Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington flung open the door. All was darkness within. She\r\nswitched on the light. The room was empty.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they're under the bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and look.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose he bites at me.\"\r\n\r\nNothing is truer than that the secret of all successful operations\r\nconsists in the overlooking of no eventuality, but it was plain that\r\nMrs. Waddington considered that in this instance her ally was carrying\r\ncaution too far. She turned on him with a snort of annoyance: and,\r\nhaving turned, remained staring frozenly at something that had suddenly\r\nmanifested itself in his lordship's rear.\r\n\r\nThis something was a long, stringy policeman: and, though Mrs.\r\nWaddington had met this policeman only once in her life, the\r\ncircumstances of that meeting had been such that the memory of him had\r\nlingered. She recognised him immediately: and, strong woman though\r\nshe was, wilted like a snail that has just received a handful of salt\r\nbetween the eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" inquired Lord Hunstanton. He, too, turned. \"Oh, what ho!\r\nthe constabulary!\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Garroway was gazing at Mrs. Waddington with an eye from which\r\none of New York's Bohemian evenings had wiped every trace of its\r\ncustomary mildness. So intense, indeed, was the malevolence of its\r\ngleam that, if there had been two such eyes boring into hers, it is\r\nprobable that Mrs. Waddington would have swooned. Fortunately, the\r\nother was covered with a piece of raw steak and a bandage, and so was\r\nout of action.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\nThere is little in the word \"Ah!\" when you write it down and take a\r\nlook at it to suggest that under certain conditions it can be one\r\nof the most sinister words in the language. But hear it spoken by\r\na policeman in whose face you have recently thrown pepper, and you\r\nwill be surprised. To Mrs. Waddington, as she shrank back into the\r\nsleeping-porch, it seemed a sort of combination of an Indian war-whoop,\r\nthe Last Trump, and the howl of a pursuing wolf-pack. Her knees\r\nweakened beneath her, and she collapsed on the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Copped you, have I?\" proceeded the policeman.\r\n\r\nThe question was plainly a rhetorical one, for he did not pause for a\r\nreply. He adjusted the bandage that held the steak, and continued his\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n\"You're pinched!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Lord Hunstanton that all this was very odd and irregular.\r\n\r\n\"I say, look here, you know, what I mean to say is....\"\r\n\r\n\"So are you,\" said Officer Garroway. \"You seem to be in it, too. You're\r\nboth pinched. And start any funny business,\" concluded the constable,\r\nswinging his night-stick in a ham-like fist, \"and I'll bend this over\r\nyour nut. Get me?\"\r\n\r\nThere followed one of those pauses which so often punctuate the\r\nconversation of comparative strangers. Officer Garroway seemed to\r\nhave said his say. Mrs. Waddington had no observations to make. And,\r\nthough Lord Hunstanton would have liked to put a question or two, the\r\nspectacle of that oscillating night-stick had the effect of driving the\r\nwords out of his head. It was the sort of night-stick that gave one a\r\nthrobbing feeling about the temples merely to look at it. He swallowed\r\nfeebly, but made no remark.\r\n\r\nAnd then from somewhere below there sounded the voice of one who cried\r\n\"Beamish! Hey, Beamish!\" It was the voice of Sigsbee H. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nNothing is more annoying to the reader of a chronicle like this than to\r\nhave somebody suddenly popping up in some given spot and to find that\r\nthe historian does not propose to offer any explanation as to how he\r\ngot there. A conscientious recorder should explain the exits and the\r\nentrances of even so insignificant a specimen of the race as Sigsbee H.\r\nWaddington: and the present scribe must now take time off in order to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nSigsbee H., it may be remembered, had started out to search through New\r\nYork for a policeman named Gallagher: and New York had given him of its\r\nabundance. It had provided for Mr. Waddington's inspection a perfect\r\nwealth of Gallaghers: but, owing to the fact that what he really wished\r\nto meet was not a Gallagher but a Garroway, nothing in the nature of\r\nsolid success had rewarded his efforts. He had seen tall Gallaghers and\r\nsmall Gallaghers, thin Gallaghers and stout Gallaghers, a cross-eyed\r\nGallagher, a pimpled Gallagher, a Gallagher with red hair, a Gallagher\r\nwith a broken nose, two Gallaghers who looked like bad dreams, and a\r\nfinal supreme Gallagher who looked like nothing on earth. But he had\r\nnot found the man to whom he had sold the stock of the Finer and\r\nBetter Motion Picture Company of Hollywood, Cal.\r\n\r\nMany men in such a position would have given up the struggle. Sigsbee\r\nH. Waddington did. The last Gallagher had been on duty in the\r\nneighbourhood of Bleeker Street, and Mr. Waddington, turning into\r\nWashington Square, tottered to a bench and sagged down on it.\r\n\r\nFor some moments, the ecstatic relief of resting his feet occupied his\r\nmind to the exclusion of everything else. Then there occurred to him\r\na thought which, had it arrived earlier in the day, would have saved\r\nhim a considerable output of energy. He suddenly recollected that he\r\nhad met the missing policeman at the apartment of Hamilton Beamish:\r\nand, pursuing this train of thought to its logical conclusion, decided\r\nthat Hamilton Beamish was the one person who would be able to give him\r\ninformation as to the man's whereabouts.\r\n\r\nNo tonic, however popular and widely-advertised, could have had so\r\ninstantly revivifying an effect. The difference between Mr. Waddington\r\nbefore taking and after taking this inspiration was almost magical.\r\nAn instant before, he had been lying back on the bench in a used-up\r\nattitude which would have convinced any observer that the only thing to\r\ndo with a man in such a stage of exhausted dejection was to notify the\r\nCity authorities and have him swept up and deposited in the incinerator\r\nwith the rest of the local garbage. But now, casting off despair like\r\na cloak, he sprang from his seat and was across the Square and heading\r\nfor the Sheridan before such an observer would have had time to say\r\n\"What ho!\"\r\n\r\nNot even the fact that the elevator was not running could check his\r\nexhilarated progress. He skimmed up the stairs to Hamilton Beamish's\r\ndoor like a squirrel.\r\n\r\n\"Beamish!\" he cried. \"Hey, Beamish!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp on the roof, Officer Garroway started as a war-horse at the sound\r\nof the bugle. He knew that voice. And, if it should seem remarkable\r\nthat he should have remembered it after so many days, having been in\r\nconversation with it but once, the explanation is that Mr. Waddington's\r\nvoice had certain tonal qualities that rendered it individual and\r\ndistinctive. You might mistake it for a squeaking file, but you could\r\nnot mistake it for the voice of anybody but Sigsbee H. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" said Officer Garroway, shaking like an aspen.\r\n\r\nThe voice had had its effect also on Mrs. Waddington. She started up as\r\nif the bed on which she sat had become suddenly incandescent.\r\n\r\n\"Siddown!\" said Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington sat down.\r\n\r\n\"My dear old constable,\" began Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" said Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\nLord Hunstanton shut up.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" said Officer Garroway once more.\r\n\r\nHe eyed his prisoners in an agony of indecision. He was in the\r\nunfortunate position of wanting to be in two places at once. To rush\r\ndown the stairs and accost the man who had sold him that stock would\r\nmean that he would have to leave these two birds, with the result\r\nthat they would undoubtedly escape. And that they should escape was\r\nthe last thing in the world that Officer Garroway desired. These two\r\nrepresented the most important capture he had made since he had joined\r\nthe Force. The female bird was a detected burglar and assaulter of the\r\npolice, and he rather fancied that, when he took him to headquarters\r\nand looked him up in the Rogues Gallery, the male bird would prove to\r\nbe Willie the Dude, wanted in Syracuse for slipping the snide. To land\r\nthem in the coop meant promotion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to go down and get his fingers nicely placed about\r\nthe throat of the man downstairs meant that he would get his three\r\nhundred dollars back.\r\n\r\nWhat to do? What to do?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, gosh! Oh, Gee!\" sighed Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\nA measured footstep made itself heard. There came into his range of\r\nvision an ambassadorial-looking man with a swelling waistcoat and a\r\nspot of ink on his nose. And, seeing him, the policeman uttered a cry\r\nof elation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" said Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\" said the new-comer.\r\n\r\n\"You're a deputy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. I am a butler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, Be-eeeee-mish!\" bleated the voice below.\r\n\r\nIt roused the policeman to a frenzy of direct action. In a calmer\r\nmoment he might have been quelled by the protruding green-grey eyes\r\nthat were looking at him with such quiet austerity: but now they had no\r\nterrors for him.\r\n\r\n\"You're a deputy,\" he repeated. \"You know what that means, don't you,\r\ndumb-bell? I'm an officer of the Law and I appoint you my deputy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no desire to be a deputy,\" said the other with the cold\r\nsub-tinkle in his voice which had once made the younger son of a\r\nmarquess resign from his clubs and go to Uganda.\r\n\r\nIt was wasted on Officer Garroway. The man was berserk.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right what you desire and don't desire. I've made you a\r\ndeputy, and you'll be one or go up the river for resisting an officer\r\nof the Law, besides getting a dot over the bean with this stick that'll\r\nmake you wish you hadn't. Now then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The position being such as you have outlined,\" said the butler with\r\ndignity, \"I have no alternative but to comply with your wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rupert Anthony Ferris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in the employment of Mrs. Sigsbee H. Waddington, at present\r\nresiding at Hempstead, Long Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've got two birds in here that are wanted at headquarters, see?\r\nI'm locking them in.\" Officer Garroway slammed the door and turned the\r\nkey. \"Now, all you have to do is to stand on guard till I come back.\r\nNot much to ask, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The task appears to be well within the scope of my powers, and I shall\r\nendeavour to fulfil it faithfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go to it,\" said Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\nFerris stood with his back to the sleeping-porch, looking at the moon\r\nwith a touch of wistfulness. Moonlight nights always made him a little\r\nhome-sick, for Brangmarley Hall had been at its best on such occasions.\r\nHow often had he, then a careless, light-hearted footman, watched the\r\nmoon-beams reflected on the waters of the moat and, with all the little\r\nsounds of the English country whispering in his ear, pondered idly on\r\nwhat would win the two o'clock race at Ally Pally next day. Happy days!\r\nHappy days!\r\n\r\nThe sound of some one murmuring his name brought his wandering thoughts\r\nback to the workaday world. He looked about him with interest, which\r\ndeepened as he saw that he had apparently got the roof to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris!\"\r\n\r\nThe butler was a man who never permitted himself to be surprised, but\r\nhe was conscious now of something not unlike that emotion. Disembodied\r\nvoices which whispered his name were new in his experience. It could\r\nhardly be one of the two birds in the sleeping-porch that was speaking,\r\nfor they were behind concrete walls and a solid door, and would have\r\nhad to raise their voices far louder to make themselves heard.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris!\"\r\n\r\nPossibly an angel, thought the butler: and was turning his mind to\r\nother things when he perceived that in the wall by which he stood there\r\nwas a small window high up in the concrete. So it was one of the birds,\r\nafter all. Scarcely had he made the discovery of the window when the\r\nvoice spoke again, and so distinctly this time that he was able to\r\nrecognise it as that of his employer, Mrs. Sigsbee H. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam?\" said Ferris.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, Ferris--Mrs. Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say? Come closer. I can't hear you.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler, though not a man who did this sort of thing as a general\r\nrule, indulgently stretched a point and stood on tip-toe. He advanced\r\nhis mouth towards the hole in the wall and repeated his remark.\r\n\r\n\"I said 'Very good, madam,'\" explained this modern Pyramus.\r\n\r\n\"Oh? Well, be quick, Ferris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quick, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quick and let us out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wish me to release you, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\nThe butler, who had found the strain of standing on tip-toe a little\r\nhard on his fallen arches, reared himself up once more.\r\n\r\n\"I said 'H'm!' madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\" asked the voice of Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\n\"He said 'H'm!'\" replied the voice of Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know? I believe the man has been drinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let _me_ talk to the fellow,\" said Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then a male understudy took up Thisbe's portion of\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\" said Ferris.\r\n\r\n\"You out there, what's your name....\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is--and has always been--Ferris, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Ferris, listen to me and understand that I'm not the\r\nsort of man to stand any dashed nonsense or anything like that of any\r\ndescription whatsoever. Why, when this dear, good lady told you to let\r\nus out, did you reply 'H'm!'? Answer me that--yes or no.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler raised himself on tip-toe again.\r\n\r\n\"The ejaculation was intended to convey doubt, your lordship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubt? What about?\"\r\n\r\n\"As to whether I could see my way to letting you out, your lordship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a silly idiot. It's not so dark as all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was alluding to the difficulties confronting me as the result of the\r\npeculiar position in which I find myself situated, your lordship.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\" asked the voice of Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Something about his peculiar position.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is he in a peculiar position?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! There you have me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let _me_ talk to the man.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a scuffling noise, followed by a heavy fall and a plaintive\r\ncry from a female in distress.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that chair would break if you stood on it,\" said Lord\r\nHunstanton. \"I wish I could have had a small bet on that chair breaking\r\nif you stood on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wheel the bed under the window,\" replied the indomitable woman beside\r\nhim. She had lost an inch of skin from her right ankle, but her hat was\r\nstill in the ring.\r\n\r\nA grating noise proclaimed the shifting of the bed. There was a creak\r\nof springs beneath a heavy weight. The window, in its capacity of loud\r\nspeaker, announced Mrs. Waddington calling.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Why is your position peculiar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am a deputy, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I represent the Law, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\" asked Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\n\"The Law,\" said Mrs. Waddington. \"He says he represents the Law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let _me_ speak to the blighter!\"\r\n\r\nThere was another interval, which the butler employed in massaging his\r\naching insteps.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's all this rot about your representing the Law?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was placed in a position of trust by the officer who has recently\r\nleft us. He instructed me to guard your lordship and Mrs. Waddington\r\nand to see that you did not effect your escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Ferris, try not to be more of an ass than you can help. Pull\r\nyourself together and use your intelligence. You surely don't suppose\r\nthat Mrs. Waddington and I have done anything wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not my place to speculate on the point which you have raised,\r\nyour lordship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Ferris. Let's get down to the stern, practical side of this\r\nbusiness. If the old feudal spirit hadn't died out completely, you'd\r\ndo a little thing like letting us out of this place for the pure love\r\nof service, if you know what I mean. But, seeing that we live in a\r\ncommercial age, what's the figure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you suggesting that I should accept a bribe, your lordship? Am\r\nI to understand that you propose that, in return for money, I should\r\nbetray my trust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. How much?\"\r\n\r\n\"How much has your lordship got?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\" asked Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"He asked how much we'd got.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Money.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wishes to extort money from us?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what it sounded like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let _me_ speak to the man.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington came to the window.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your behaviour surprises and revolts me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cease from this moment to be in my employment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you desire, madam.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington retired for a brief consultation with her companion.\r\n\r\n\"Ferris,\" she said, returning to the window.\r\n\r\n\"Madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is all the money we have,--two hundred and fifteen dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be ample, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then kindly make haste and unlock this door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, madam.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington waited, chafing. The moments passed.\r\n\r\n\"Madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret to have to inform you, madam,\" said Ferris respectfully,\r\n\"that, when the policeman went away, he took the key with him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had taken George some considerable time to establish connection with\r\nthe Waddington home at Hempstead; but he had done it at last, only to\r\nbe informed that Molly did not appear to be on the premises. She had\r\ndriven up in her two-seater, a Swedish voice gave him to understand,\r\nbut after remaining in the house a short while had driven off again.\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" said George, as his informant was beginning to relapse into her\r\nnative tongue.\r\n\r\nA yeasty feeling of pleasure and good-will towards his species filled\r\nhim as he hung up the receiver. If Molly had started back to New York,\r\nhe might expect to see her at any moment now. His heart swelled: and\r\nthe fact that he was in the unfortunate position of being a fugitive\r\nfrom justice and the additional fact that the bloodhound of the Law\r\nmost interested in his movements was probably somewhere very close at\r\nhand entirely escaped him. Abandoning the caution which should have\r\nbeen the first thought of one situated as he was, he burst into jovial\r\nsong.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Pinch!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge, who had been climbing towards a high note, came back to earth\r\nagain, chilled and apprehensive. His first impulse was to dash for his\r\nbedroom and hide under the bed--a thing which he knew himself to be\r\ngood at. Then his intelligence asserted itself and panic waned. Only\r\none man of his acquaintance could have addressed him as \"Hey, Pinch!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that Mr. Waddington?\" he murmured, opening the door of the\r\nsitting-room and peering in.\r\n\r\n\"Sure it's Mr. Waddington.\" The reek of a lively young cigar assailed\r\nGeorge's nostrils. \"Don't you have any lights in this joint?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any policemen about?\" asked George in a conspiratorial\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n\"There's one policeman down in young Beamish's apartment,\" replied Mr.\r\nWaddington with a fruity chuckle. \"He's just sold me all his holdings\r\nin the Finer and Better Motion Picture Company of Hollywood, Cal., for\r\nthree hundred smackers: and I've come here to celebrate. Set up the\r\ndrinks,\" said Mr. Waddington, who was plainly in as festive a mood as a\r\nman can be without actually breaking up the furniture.\r\n\r\nGeorge switched on the light. If the enemy was in as distant a spot as\r\nHamilton Beamish's apartment, prudence might be relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"'At's right,\" said Mr. Waddington, welcoming the illumination. He\r\nwas leaning against a book-shelf with his hat on the back of his head\r\nand a cigar between his lips. His eyes were sparkling with an almost\r\nhuman intelligence. \"I've got a smart business head, Pinch,\" he said,\r\nshooting the cigar from due east to due west with a single movement of\r\nhis upper lip. \"I'm the guy with the big brain.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough all the data which he had been able to accumulate in the\r\ncourse of their acquaintanceship went directly to prove the opposite,\r\nGeorge was not inclined to combat the statement. He had weightier\r\nmatters to occupy him than an academic discussion of the mentality of\r\nthis poor fish.\r\n\r\n\"I found that girl,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl who stole the necklace. And I've got the necklace.\"\r\n\r\nHe had selected a subject that gripped. Mr. Waddington ceased to\r\ncontemplate the smartness of his business head and became interested.\r\nHis eyes widened, and he blew out a puff of poison-gas.\r\n\r\n\"You don't say!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gimme!\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\nGeorge dangled the necklace undecidedly.\r\n\r\n\"I think I ought to hand it over to Molly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll hand it over to me,\" said Mr. Waddington with decision. \"I'm\r\nthe head of the family, and from now on I act as such. Too long,\r\nPinch, have I allowed myself to be trampled beneath the iron heel and\r\ngenerally kicked in the face with spiked shoes, if you get my meaning.\r\nI now assert myself. Starting from to-day and onward through the\r\nyears till my friends and relatives gather about my bier and whisper,\r\n'Doesn't he look peaceful,' what I say goes. Give me that necklace. I\r\nintend to have it reset or something. Either that, or I shall sell it\r\nand give Molly the proceeds. In any case, and be that as it may, gimme\r\nthat necklace!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge gave it to him. There was a strange new atmosphere of authority\r\nabout Sigsbee H. to-night that made one give him things when he asked\r\nfor them. He had the air of a man whom somebody has been feeding meat.\r\n\r\n\"Pinch,\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Finch,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"George,\" said a voice at the window, speaking with a startling\r\nabruptness which caused Mr. Waddington to jerk his cigar into his eye.\r\n\r\nA wave of emotion poured over George.\r\n\r\n\"Molly! Is that you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, darling. Here I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"How quick you've been.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hurried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Though it seems hours since you went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it really, precious?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington was still shaken.\r\n\r\n\"If I had been told that any daughter of mine would come and bark at me\r\nfrom behind like that,\" he said querulously, \"I would not have believed\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father! There you are. I didn't see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Mr. Waddington, \"is right. You nearly scared the top of\r\nmy head off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late to be sorry now,\" said Mr. Waddington moodily. \"You've gone\r\nand spoiled the best ten-cent cigar in Hempstead.\"\r\n\r\nHe eyed the remains sadly: and, throwing them away, selected another\r\nfrom his upper waistcoat-pocket and bit the end off.\r\n\r\n\"Molly, my angel,\" said George vibrantly, \"fancy you really being with\r\nme once more!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Georgie, darling. And what I wanted to say was, I believe\r\nthere's somebody in your sleeping-porch.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I heard voices.\"\r\n\r\nCome right down to it, and there is no instinct so deeply rooted in the\r\nnature of Man as the respect for property--his own property, that is to\r\nsay. And just as the mildest dog will tackle bloodhounds in defence of\r\nits own backyard, so will the veriest of human worms turn if attacked\r\nin his capacity of householder. The news that there was somebody in his\r\nsleeping-porch caused George to seethe with pique and indignation. It\r\nseemed to him that the entire population of New York had come to look\r\non his sleeping-porch as a public resort. No sooner had he ejected one\r\nbatch of visitors than another took their place.\r\n\r\nWith a wordless exclamation he rushed out upon the roof, closely\r\nfollowed by Molly and her father. Molly was afraid he would get hurt.\r\nSigsbee H. was afraid he would not. It had been a big night for Sigsbee\r\nH. Waddington, and he did not want it to end tamely.\r\n\r\n\"Have your gun ready,\" advised Sigsbee H., keeping well in the rear,\r\n\"and don't fire till you see the whites of their eyes.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge reached the door of the sleeping-porch, and smote it a lusty\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\" he cried. He twisted the handle. \"Good heavens, it's locked.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the upper window, softened by distance, came a pleading voice.\r\n\r\n\"I say! I say! I say!\" To Lord Hunstanton the beating on the door had\r\nsounded like the first guns of a relieving army. He felt like the girl\r\nwho heard the pipers skirling as they marched on beleaguered Lucknow.\r\n\"I say, whoever you are, dear old soul, let us out, would you mind.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge ground his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--whoever you are? I'm George Finch, and that\r\nsleeping-porch belongs to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good old George! Hunstanton speaking. Let us out, George, old top,\r\nlike the sportsman you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing in there?\"\r\n\r\n\"A policeman locked us in. And a blighter of a butler, after promising\r\nto undo the door, told some thin story about not being able to find the\r\nkey and legged it with all our available assets. So play the man, dear\r\nold George, and blessings will reward you. Also and moreover, by acting\r\npromptly you will save the life of my dear good friend and hostess\r\nhere, who has been hiccoughing for some little time and is, I rather\r\nfancy, on the point of hysterics.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Waddington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Mrs. Waddington in there with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she not, laddie!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge drew his breath sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" he said reproachfully in through the keyhole, \"I had not\r\nexpected this.\"\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington uttered a fearful cry.\r\n\r\n\"My wife! In there! With a man with a tooth-brush moustache! Let\r\n_me_ talk to them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was that?\" asked Lord Hunstanton.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Waddington,\" replied George. \"Who was that?\" he said, as a scream\r\nrent the air.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Waddington. I say, George, old man,\" queried his lordship\r\nanxiously, \"what do you do when a woman starts turning blue and making\r\nlittle bubbling noises?\"\r\n\r\nSigsbee H., finding that a man of his stature could not hope to speak\r\nto any advantage through the window unless he stood on something, had\r\ndarted across the roof and was now returning with one of the potted\r\nshrubs in his arms. The wildness of his eyes and the fact that even\r\nin this supreme moment he had gone on puffing at his cigar gave him a\r\nstriking resemblance to a fire-eating dragon. He bumped the tub down\r\nand, like a man who rises on stepping-stones of his dead self to higher\r\nthings, elevated himself upon it.\r\n\r\nThis brought him nicely within range of the window and enabled him\r\nto push Lord Hunstanton in the face--which was all to the good. His\r\nlordship staggered back, leaving the way clear for the injured man to\r\ngaze upon his erring wife.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Sigsbee H. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"I can explain everything, Sigsbee!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington snorted.\r\n\r\n\"Nerve,\" he said, \"in its proper place and when there's not too much of\r\nit, I admire. But when a woman has the crust to disparage the morals of\r\none of the finest young fellows who ever came out of the golden West\r\nand then I happen to pop into New York on important business and find\r\nher closeted with a man with a tooth-brush moustache and she has the\r\naudacity to say she can explain everything....\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Waddington paused to take in breath.\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's living in this soul-destroying East that does it,\" proceeded Mr.\r\nWaddington, having re-filled his thoracic cavities. \"If I've said it\r\nonce, I've said it a hundred times, that....\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Sigsbee, I couldn't help it. It's quite true what Lord Hunstanton\r\nwas saying. A policeman locked us in.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were you doing up here, anyway?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence within.\r\n\r\n\"I came to see what that Finch was doing. And I heard him in here,\r\ntalking to an abandoned creature.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington directed a questioning gaze at George.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been talking to any abandoned creatures to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he hasn't,\" cried Molly indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken with no one of the opposite sex,\" said George with\r\ndignity, \"except the girl who stole the necklace. And that was a purely\r\nbusiness discussion which would not have brought a blush to the cheek\r\nof the sternest critic. I said 'Hand over that necklace!' and she\r\nhanded it over, and then her husband came and took her away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear?\" said Mr. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" said Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Well, take it from me that this splendid young man from the West is as\r\npure as driven snow. So now let's hear from you once more. Why did the\r\npoliceman lock you in?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had a misunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I--er--happened to throw a little pepper in his face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sweet artichokes of Jerusalem! Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"He found me in Mr. Finch's apartment and wanted to arrest me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington's voice grew cold and grim.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" he said. \"Well, this finishes it! If you can't live in the\r\nEast without spending your time throwing pepper at policemen, you'll\r\ncome straight out with me to the West before you start attacking them\r\nwith hatchets. That is my final and unalterable decision. Come West,\r\nwoman, where hearts are pure, and there try to start a new life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, Sigsbee, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet your permanent henna hair-wash you will!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll buy the transportation to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir!\" Mr. Waddington with a grand gesture nearly overbalanced the\r\ntub on which he stood. \"I will buy the transportation to-morrow. You\r\nwill be interested to learn that, owing to commercial transactions\r\nresulting from the possession of a smart business head, I am now once\r\nmore an exceedingly wealthy man and able to buy all the transportation\r\nthis family requires and to run this family as it should be run.\r\nI'm the big noise now. Yes, me--Sigsbee Horatio....\" The tub tilted\r\nsideways, and the speaker staggered into the arms of Officer Garroway,\r\nwho had come up to the roof to see how his prisoners were getting on\r\nand was surprised to find himself plunged into the middle of what\r\nappeared to be a debating society.\r\n\r\n\"... Waddington,\" concluded Sigsbee H.\r\n\r\nThe policeman eyed him coldly. The fever of dislike which he had\r\nfelt towards this man had passed, but he could never look on him as a\r\nfriend. Moreover, Mr. Waddington, descending from the tub, had stamped\r\nheavily on his right foot, almost the only portion of his anatomy which\r\nhad up till then come unscathed through the adventures of the night.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this?\" inquired Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\nHis eye fell upon George: and he uttered that low, sinister growl which\r\nis heard only from the throats of leopards seeking their prey, tigers\r\nabout to give battle, and New York policemen who come unexpectedly upon\r\nmen who have thrown table-cloths over them and hit them in the eye.\r\n\r\n\"So there you are!\" said Officer Garroway.\r\n\r\nHe poised his night-stick in his hand, and moved softly forward. Molly\r\nflung herself in his path with a cry.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss,\" said the policeman, courteously as was his wont in the presence\r\nof the sex. \"Oblige me by getting to hell out of here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Garroway!\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman wheeled sharply. Only one man in the world would\r\nhave been able to check his dreadful designs at that moment, and\r\nthat man had now joined the group. Clad in a sweater and a pair of\r\nrunning-shorts, Hamilton Beamish made a strangely dignified and\r\npicturesque figure as he stood there with the moonlight glinting on his\r\nhorn-rimmed spectacles. He wore soft shoes with rubber soles, and he\r\nwas carrying a pair of dumb-bells. Hamilton Beamish was a man who lived\r\nby schedule: and not all that he had passed through that day could\r\nblur his mind to the fact that this was the hour at which he did his\r\nbefore-retiring dumb-bell exercises.\r\n\r\n\"What is the trouble, Garroway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Beamish....\"\r\n\r\nConfused voices interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"He was trying to murder George.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's got my wife locked up in this room.\"\r\n\r\n\"The brute!\"\r\n\r\n\"Darned fresh guy.\"\r\n\r\n\"George didn't do a thing to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife only threw a little pepper in his face.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish raised a compelling dumb-bell.\r\n\r\n\"Please, please! Garroway, state your case.\"\r\n\r\nHe listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\"Unlock that door,\" he said, when all was told.\r\n\r\nThe policeman unlocked the door. Mrs. Waddington, followed by Lord\r\nHunstanton, emerged. Lord Hunstanton eyed Mr. Waddington warily, and\r\nsidled with an air of carelessness towards the stairway. Accelerating\r\nhis progress as he neared the door, he vanished abruptly. Lord\r\nHunstanton was a well-bred man who hated a fuss: and every instinct\r\ntold him that this was one. He was better elsewhere, he decided.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that man!\" ejaculated Officer Garroway. He turned back, baffled,\r\nwith a darkening brow. \"Now he's gone!\" he said soberly. \"And he was\r\nwanted up in Syracuse.\"\r\n\r\nSigsbee H. Waddington shook his head. He was not fond of that town, but\r\nhe had a fair mind.\r\n\r\n\"Even in Syracuse,\" he said, \"they wouldn't want a man like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Willie the Dude, and I was going to take him to the\r\nstation-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, Garroway,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"That was Lord\r\nHunstanton, a personal acquaintance of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know him, Mr. Beamish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know her?\" asked the policeman, pointing to Mrs. Waddington.\r\n\r\n\"Intimately.\"\r\n\r\n\"And him?\" said Officer Garroway, indicating George.\r\n\r\n\"He is one of my best friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman heaved a dreary sigh. He relapsed into silence, baffled.\r\n\r\n\"The whole affair,\" said Hamilton Beamish, \"appears to have been\r\ndue to a foolish misunderstanding. This lady, Garroway, is the\r\nstepmother of this young lady here, to whom Mr. Finch should have\r\nbeen married to-day. There was some little trouble, I understand from\r\nMr. Waddington, and she was left with the impression that Mr. Finch's\r\nmorals were not all they should have been. Later, facts which came to\r\nlight convinced her of her error, and she hastened to New York to seek\r\nMr. Finch out and tell him that all was well and that the marriage\r\nwould proceed with her full approval. That is correct, Mrs. Waddington?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington gulped. For a moment her eye seemed about to resume its\r\nwell-known expression of a belligerent fish. But her spirit was broken.\r\nShe was not the woman she had been. She had lost the old form.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.... Yes.... That is to say ... I mean, yes,\" she replied huskily.\r\n\r\n\"You called at Mr. Finch's apartment with no other motive than to tell\r\nhim this?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.... Or, rather.... No, none.\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact, to put the thing in a nutshell, you wished to find your\r\nfuture son-in-law and fold him in a mother-in-law's embrace. Am I\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\nThis time the pause before Mrs. Waddington found herself able to reply\r\nwas so marked and the look she directed at George so full of meaning\r\nthat the latter, always sensitive, could not but wonder whether in\r\nrefraining from punching her on the nose he was not neglecting his duty\r\nas a man and a citizen. She gazed at him long and lingeringly. Then she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" she said huskily.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"So you see, Garroway, that Mrs.\r\nWaddington's reason for being in the apartment where you found her was\r\nwholly admirable. That clears up that point.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't clear up why she threw pepper in my face.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish nodded.\r\n\r\n\"There, Garroway,\" he said, \"you have put your finger on the one\r\naspect of Mrs. Waddington's behaviour which was not completely\r\nunexceptionable. As regards the pepper, you have, it seems to me,\r\nlegitimate cause for pique and, indeed, solid grounds for an action\r\nfor assault and battery. But Mrs. Waddington is a reasonable woman,\r\nand will, no doubt, be willing to settle this little matter in a way\r\nacceptable to all parties.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will pay him whatever he wants,\" cried the reasonable woman.\r\n\"Anything, anything!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Sigsbee H. He stood there, forceful and dominant.\r\nHis cigar had gone out, and he was chewing the dry remains aggressively.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen!\" said Sigsbee H. Waddington. \"If there's any bribing\r\nof the police to be done, it's my place to do it, as the head of\r\nthe family. Look me up at my little place at Hempstead to-morrow,\r\nGallagher, and we'll have a talk. You will find me a generous man.\r\nOpen-handed. Western.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital,\" said Hamilton Beamish. \"So everything is happily settled.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not much of Officer Garroway's face that was not concealed by\r\nthe bandage and the steak, but on the small residuum there appeared a\r\nlook of doubt and dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"And what about this bird here?\" he asked, indicating George.\r\n\r\n\"This individual before me,\" corrected Hamilton Beamish. \"What about\r\nhim, Garroway?\"\r\n\r\n\"He soaked me in the eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt in a spirit of wholesome fun. Where did this happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down there in the Purple Chicken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Well, if you knew that restaurant better, you would understand\r\nthat that sort of thing is the merest commonplace of everyday life at\r\nthe Purple Chicken. You must overlook it, Garroway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I push his head down his throat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. I cannot have you annoying Mr. Finch. He is to be\r\nmarried to-morrow, and he is a friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But....\"\r\n\r\n\"Garroway,\" said Hamilton Beamish, in a quiet, compelling voice, \"Mr.\r\nFinch is a friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Mr. Beamish,\" said the policeman resignedly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington was plucking at her husband's sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sigsbee, dear, I'm starving. I have had nothing to eat since lunch.\r\nThere is some wonderful soup in there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" said Sigsbee H. \"You coming?\" he said to George.\r\n\r\n\"I thought of taking Molly off somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, do come with us, George,\" said Mrs. Waddington winningly.\r\nShe drew closer to him. \"George, is it really true that you hit that\r\npoliceman in the eye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was trying to arrest me, so I threw a table-cloth over his\r\nhead and then plugged him a couple of rather juicy ones which made him\r\nleave go.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Waddington's eyes glistened. She put her arm through his.\r\n\r\n\"George,\" she said, \"I have misjudged you. I could wish Molly no better\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish stood in the moonlight, swinging his dumb-bells.\r\nHaving done this for awhile, he embarked on a few simple setting-up\r\nexercises. He stood with his feet some six inches apart, his toes\r\nturned slightly out: then, placing his hands on his hips, thumbs\r\nback, bent slightly forward from the shoulders--not from the hips.\r\nHe retracted the lower abdomen, and, holding it retracted, leaned\r\nwell over to the left side, contracting the muscles of the left side\r\nforcibly. He kept his legs straight all the time, his knees stiff. He\r\nreversed to right side, and repeated twenty times--ten right, ten left.\r\nThis exercise was done slowly and steadily, without jerking.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Hamilton Beamish, relaxing. \"Splendid for the transversalis\r\nmuscle, that, converting it into a living belt which girds the loins.\r\nHave you ever given considered thought to the loins, Garroway?\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Not that I know of,\" he said indifferently. \"I've seen 'em in the\r\nBronx Zoo.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish eyed him with concern.\r\n\r\n\"Garroway,\" he said, \"you seem distrait.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's how a feller is when he's been hit and punched, and stepped\r\non and had pepper thrown at him and table-cloths put over his head I've\r\ngot a swell license to seem distrait,\" replied the policeman bitterly.\r\n\"And on top of all that, when I thought I had made a cop....\"\r\n\r\n\"Brought about an arrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"... brought about an arrest which would have got me promotion, I find\r\nthey're all friends of yours and have to be allowed to make a clean\r\ngetaway. That's what jars me, Mr. Beamish.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton Beamish patted him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Every poet, Garroway, has to learn in suffering before he can teach\r\nin song. Look at Keats! Look at Chatterton! One of these days you will\r\nbe thankful that all this has happened. It will be the making of you.\r\nBesides, think of the money you are going to get from Mr. Waddington\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd give it all for one long, cool drink now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Garroway.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman looked up. Molly was standing in the window.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Garroway,\" said Molly, \"a most mysterious thing has happened. Mr.\r\nFinch has found two large bottles of champagne in his cupboard. He\r\ncan't think how they got there, but he says would you care to come in\r\nand examine them and see whether they are good or not.\"\r\n\r\nThe cloud which had hung about the policeman's face passed from it as\r\nif beneath some magic spell. His tongue came slowly out of his mouth\r\nand moved lovingly over his arid lips. His one visible eye gleamed with\r\nthe light which never was on land or sea.\r\n\r\n\"Are you with me, Mr. Beamish?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I precede you, Mr. Garroway,\" said Hamilton Beamish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          By P.
