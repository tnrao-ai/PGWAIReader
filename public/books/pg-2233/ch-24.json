    "Out on the terrace the night was very still. From a steel-blue sky\r\nthe stars looked down as calmly as they had looked on the night of\r\nthe ball, when George had waited by the shrubbery listening to the\r\nwailing of the music and thinking long thoughts. From the dark\r\nmeadows by the brook came the cry of a corncrake, its harsh note\r\nsoftened by distance.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" said Maud. She was sitting on the stone seat\r\nwhere Reggie Byng had sat and meditated on his love for Alice\r\nFaraday and his unfortunate habit of slicing his approach-shots. To\r\nGeorge, as he stood beside her, she was a white blur in the\r\ndarkness. He could not see her face.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know!\" he said frankly.\r\n\r\nNor did he. Like Lady Caroline and Lord Belpher and Keggs, the\r\nbutler, he had been completely overwhelmed by Lord Marshmoreton's\r\ndramatic announcement. The situation had come upon him unheralded\r\nby any warning, and had found him unequal to it.\r\n\r\nA choking sound suddenly proceeded from the whiteness that was\r\nMaud. In the stillness it sounded like some loud noise. It jarred\r\non George's disturbed nerves.\r\n\r\n\"Please!\"\r\n\r\n\"I c-can't help it!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing to cry about, really! If we think long enough, we\r\nshall find some way out all right. Please don't cry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not crying!\" The choking sound became an unmistakable ripple of\r\nmirth. \"It's so absurd! Poor father getting up like that in front\r\nof everyone! Did you see Aunt Caroline's face?\"\r\n\r\n\"It haunts me still,\" said George. \"I shall never forget it. Your\r\nbrother didn't seem any too pleased, either.\"\r\n\r\nMaud stopped laughing.\r\n\r\n\"It's an awful position,\" she said soberly. \"The announcement will\r\nbe in the Morning Post the day after tomorrow. And then the letters\r\nof congratulation will begin to pour in. And after that the\r\npresents. And I simply can't see how we can convince them all that\r\nthere has been a mistake.\" Another aspect of the matter struck her.\r\n\"It's so hard on you, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't think about me,\" urged George. \"Heaven knows I'd give the\r\nwhole world if we could just let the thing go on, but there's no\r\nuse discussing impossibilities.\" He lowered his voice.  \"There's no\r\nuse, either, in my pretending that I'm not going to have a pretty\r\nbad time. But we won't discuss that. It was my own fault. I came\r\nbutting in on your life of my own free will, and, whatever happens,\r\nit's been worth it to have known you and tried to be of service to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the best friend I've ever had.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you think that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The best and kindest friend any girl ever had. I wish . . .\"\r\nShe broke off. \"Oh, well. . .\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. In the castle somebody had begun to play the\r\npiano. Then a man's voice began to sing.\r\n\r\n\"That's Edwin Plummer,\" said Maud. \"How badly he sings.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge laughed. Somehow the intrusion of Plummer had removed the\r\ntension. Plummer, whether designedly and as a sombre commentary on\r\nthe situation or because he was the sort of man who does sing that\r\nparticular song, was chanting Tosti's \"Good-bye\". He was giving to\r\nits never very cheery notes a wailing melancholy all his own. A dog\r\nin the stables began to howl in sympathy, and with the sound came a\r\ncurious soothing of George's nerves. He might feel broken-hearted\r\nlater, but for the moment, with this double accompaniment, it was\r\nimpossible for a man with humour in his soul to dwell on the deeper\r\nemotions. Plummer and his canine duettist had brought him to\r\nearth. He felt calm and practical.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better talk the whole thing over quietly,\" he said.  \"There's\r\ncertain to be some solution. At the worst you can always go to Lord\r\nMarshmoreton and tell him that he spoke without a sufficient grasp\r\nof his subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could,\" said Maud, \"but, just at present, I feel as if I'd\r\nrather do anything else in the world. You don't realize what it\r\nmust have cost father to defy Aunt Caroline openly like that. Ever\r\nsince I was old enough to notice anything, I've seen how she\r\ndominated him. It was Aunt Caroline who really caused all this\r\ntrouble. If it had only been father, I could have coaxed him to let\r\nme marry anyone I pleased. I wish, if you possibly can, you would\r\nthink of some other solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't had an opportunity of telling you,\" said George, \"that I\r\ncalled at Belgrave Square, as you asked me to do. I went there\r\ndirectly I had seen Reggie Byng safely married.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see him married?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was best man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear old Reggie! I hope he will be happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will. Don't worry about that. Well, as I was saying, I called\r\nat Belgrave Square, and found the house shut up. I couldn't get any\r\nanswer to the bell, though I kept my thumb on it for minutes at a\r\ntime. I think they must have gone abroad again.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it wasn't that. I had a letter from Geoffrey this morning. His\r\nuncle died of apoplexy, while they were in Manchester on a business\r\ntrip.\" She paused. \"He left Geoffrey all his money,\" she went on.\r\n\"Every penny.\"\r\n\r\nThe silence seemed to stretch out interminably. The music from the\r\ncastle had ceased. The quiet of the summer night was unbroken. To\r\nGeorge the stillness had a touch of the sinister. It was the\r\nghastly silence of the end of the world. With a shock he realized\r\nthat even now he had been permitting himself to hope, futile as he\r\nrecognized the hope to be. Maud had told him she loved another man.\r\nThat should have been final. And yet somehow his indomitable\r\nsub-conscious self had refused to accept it as final. But this news\r\nended everything. The only obstacle that had held Maud and this man\r\napart was removed. There was nothing to prevent them marrying.\r\nGeorge was conscious of a vast depression. The last strand of the\r\nrope had parted, and he was drifting alone out into the ocean of\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he said, and was surprised that his voice sounded very much\r\nthe same as usual. Speech was so difficult that it seemed strange\r\nthat it should show no signs of effort. \"That alters everything,\r\ndoesn't it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said in his letter that he wanted me to meet him in London\r\nand--talk things over, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing now to prevent your going. I mean, now that your\r\nfather has made this announcement, you are free to go where you\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose I am.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another silence.\r\n\r\n\"Everything's so difficult,\" said Maud.\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are thinking of me,\" said George, \"please don't. I know\r\nexactly what you mean. You are hating the thought of hurting my\r\nfeelings. I wish you would look on me as having no feelings. All I\r\nwant is to see you happy. As I said just now, it's enough for me to\r\nknow that I've helped you. Do be reasonable about it. The fact that\r\nour engagement has been officially announced makes no difference in\r\nour relations to each other. As far as we two are concerned, we\r\nare exactly where we were the last time we met. It's no worse for\r\nme now than it was then to know that I'm not the man you love, and\r\nthat there's somebody else you loved before you ever knew of my\r\nexistence. For goodness' sake, a girl like you must be used to\r\nhaving men tell her that they love her and having to tell them that\r\nshe can't love them in return.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're so different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it. I'm just one of the crowd.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never known anybody quite like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've never known anybody quite like Plummer, I should\r\nimagine. But the thought of his sufferings didn't break your\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've known a million men exactly like Edwin Plummer,\" said Maud\r\nemphatically. \"All the men I ever have known have been like\r\nhim--quite nice and pleasant and negative. It never seemed to\r\nmatter refusing them. One knew that they would be just a little bit\r\npiqued for a week or two and then wander off and fall in love with\r\nsomebody else. But you're different. You . . . matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is where we disagree. My argument is that, where your\r\nhappiness is concerned, I don't matter.\"\r\n\r\nMaud rested her chin on her hand, and stared out into the velvet\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have been my brother instead of Percy,\" she said at\r\nlast. \"What chums we should have been! And how simple that would\r\nhave made everything!\"\r\n\r\n\"The best thing for you to do is to regard me as an honorary\r\nbrother. That will make everything simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's easy to talk like that . . . No, it isn't. It's horribly\r\nhard. I know exactly how difficult it is for you to talk as you\r\nhave been doing--to try to make me feel better by pretending the\r\nwhole trouble is just a trifle . . . It's strange . . . We have\r\nonly met really for a few minutes at a time, and three weeks ago I\r\ndidn't know there was such a person as you, but somehow I seem to\r\nknow everything you're thinking. I've never felt like that before\r\nwith any man . . . Even Geoffrey. . . He always puzzled me. . . .\"\r\n\r\nShe broke off. The corncrake began to call again out in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I knew what to do,\" she said with a catch in her voice.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you in two words what to do. The whole thing is absurdly\r\nsimple. You love this man and he loves you, and all that kept you\r\napart before was the fact that he could not afford to marry you.\r\nNow that he is rich, there is no obstacle at all. I simply won't\r\nlet you look on me and my feelings as an obstacle. Rule me out\r\naltogether. Your father's mistake has made the situation a little\r\nmore complicated than it need have been, but that can easily be\r\nremedied. Imitate the excellent example of Reggie Byng. He was in a\r\nposition where it would have been embarrassing to announce what he\r\nintended to do, so he very sensibly went quietly off and did it and\r\nleft everybody to find out after it was done. I'm bound to say I\r\nnever looked on Reggie as a master mind, but, when it came to find\r\na way out of embarrassing situations, one has to admit he had the\r\nright idea. Do what he did!\"\r\n\r\nMaud started. She half rose from the stone seat. George could hear\r\nthe quick intake of her breath.\r\n\r\n\"You mean--run away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Run away!\"\r\n\r\nAn automobile swung round the corner of the castle from the\r\ndirection of the garage, and drew up, purring, at the steps. There\r\nwas a flood of light and the sound of voices, as the great door\r\nopened. Maud rose.\r\n\r\n\"People are leaving,\" she said. \"I didn't know it was so late.\" She\r\nstood irresolutely. \"I suppose I ought to go in and say good-bye.\r\nBut I don't think I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay where you are. Nobody will see you.\"\r\n\r\nMore automobiles arrived. The quiet of the night was shattered by\r\nthe noise of their engines. Maud sat down again.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they will think it very odd of me not being there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind what people think. Reggie Byng didn't.\"\r\n\r\nMaud's foot traced circles on the dry turf.\r\n\r\n\"What a lovely night,\" she said. \"There's no dew at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe automobiles snorted, tooted, back-fired, and passed away.\r\nTheir clamour died in the distance, leaving the night a thing of\r\npeace and magic once more. The door of the castle closed with a\r\nbang.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I ought to be going in now,\" said Maud.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so. And I ought to be there, too, politely making my\r\nfarewells. But something seems to tell me that Lady Caroline and\r\nyour brother will be quite ready to dispense with the formalities.\r\nI shall go home.\"\r\n\r\nThey faced each other in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Would you really do that?\" asked Maud. \"Run away, I\r\nmean, and get married in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the only thing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But . . . can one get married as quickly as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"At a registrar's? Nothing simpler. You should have seen\r\nReggie Byng's wedding. It was over before one realized it had\r\nstarted. A snuffy little man in a black coat with a cold in his\r\nhead asked a few questions, wrote a few words, and the thing was\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds rather . . . dreadful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reggie didn't seem to think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unromantic, I mean. . . . Prosaic.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would supply the romance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, one ought to be sensible. It is just the same as a\r\nregular wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"In effects, absolutely.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved up the terrace together. On the gravel drive by the\r\nsteps they paused.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it!\" said Maud.\r\n\r\nGeorge had to make an effort before he could reply. For all his\r\nsane and convincing arguments, he could not check a pang at this\r\ndefinite acceptance of them. He had begun to appreciate now the\r\nstrain under which he had been speaking.\r\n\r\n\"You must,\" he said. \"Well . . . good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThere was light on the drive. He could see her face. Her eyes were\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\"What will you do?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, are you going to stay on in your cottage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I hardly think I could do that. I shall go back to London\r\ntomorrow, and stay at the Carlton for a few days. Then I shall sail\r\nfor America. There are a couple of pieces I've got to do for the\r\nFall. I ought to be starting on them.\"\r\n\r\nMaud looked away.\r\n\r\n\"You've got your work,\" she said almost inaudibly.\r\n\r\nGeorge understood her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I've got my work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"You've been very wonderful... Right from the beginning . . .\r\nYou've been . . . oh, what's the use of me saying anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've had my reward. I've known you. We're friends, aren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"My best friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pals?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pals!\"\r\n\r\nThey shook hands."
