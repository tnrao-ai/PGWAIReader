    "While George and Billie Dore wandered to the rose garden to\r\ninterview the man in corduroys, Maud had been seated not a hundred\r\nyards away--in a very special haunt of her own, a cracked stucco\r\ntemple set up in the days of the Regency on the shores of a little\r\nlily-covered pond. She was reading poetry to Albert the page.\r\n\r\nAlbert the page was a recent addition to Maud's inner circle. She\r\nhad interested herself in him some two months back in much the same\r\nspirit as the prisoner in his dungeon cell tames and pets the\r\nconventional mouse. To educate Albert, to raise him above his\r\ngroove in life and develop his soul, appealed to her romantic\r\nnature as a worthy task, and as a good way of filling in the time.\r\nIt is an exceedingly moot point--and one which his associates of\r\nthe servants' hall would have combated hotly--whether Albert\r\npossessed a soul. The most one could say for certain is that he\r\nlooked as if he possessed one. To one who saw his deep blue eyes\r\nand their sweet, pensive expression as they searched the middle\r\ndistance he seemed like a young angel. How was the watcher to know\r\nthat the thought behind that far-off gaze was simply a speculation\r\nas to whether the bird on the cedar tree was or was not within\r\nrange of his catapult? Certainly Maud had no such suspicion. She\r\nworked hopefully day by day to rouse Albert to an appreciation of\r\nthe nobler things of life.\r\n\r\nNot but what it was tough going. Even she admitted that. Albert's\r\nsoul did not soar readily. It refused to leap from the earth. His\r\nreception of the poem she was reading could scarcely have been\r\ncalled encouraging. Maud finished it in a hushed voice, and looked\r\npensively across the dappled water of the pool. A gentle breeze\r\nstirred the water-lilies, so that they seemed to sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that beautiful, Albert?\" she said.\r\n\r\nAlbert's blue eyes lit up. His lips parted eagerly,\r\n\r\n\"That's the first hornet I seen this year,\" he said pointing.\r\n\r\nMaud felt a little damped.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you been listening, Albert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, m'lady! Ain't he a wopper, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the hornet, Albert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, m'lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't say 'Very good, m'lady'. It's like--like--\"\r\nShe paused. She had been about to say that it was like a butler,\r\nbut, she reflected regretfully, it was probably Albert's dearest\r\nambition to be like a butler. \"It doesn't sound right. Just say\r\n'Yes'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, m'lady.\"\r\n\r\nMaud was not enthusiastic about the 'M'lady', but she let it go.\r\nAfter all, she had not quite settled in her own mind what exactly\r\nshe wished Albert's attitude towards herself to be. Broadly\r\nspeaking, she wanted him to be as like as he could to a medieval\r\npage, one of those silk-and-satined little treasures she had read\r\nabout in the Ingoldsby Legends. And, of course, they presumably\r\nsaid 'my lady'. And yet--she felt--not for the first time--that it\r\nis not easy, to revive the Middle Ages in these curious days. Pages\r\nlike other things, seem to have changed since then.\r\n\r\n\"That poem was written by a very clever man who married one of my\r\nancestresses. He ran away with her from this very castle in the\r\nseventeenth century.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lor'\", said Albert as a concession, but he was still interested in\r\nthe hornet.\r\n\r\n\"He was far below her in the eyes of the world, but she knew what a\r\nwonderful man he was, so she didn't mind what people said about her\r\nmarrying beneath her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Susan when she married the pleeceman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was Susan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Red-'eaded gel that used to be cook 'ere. Mr. Keggs says to 'er,\r\n'e says, 'You're marrying beneath you, Susan', 'e says. I 'eard\r\n'im. I was listenin' at the door. And she says to 'im, she says,\r\n'Oh, go and boil your fat 'ead', she says.\"\r\n\r\nThis translation of a favourite romance into terms of the servants'\r\nhall chilled Maud like a cold shower. She recoiled from it.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you like to get a good education, Albert,\" she said\r\nperseveringly, \"and become a great poet and write wonderful poems?\"\r\n\r\nAlbert considered the point, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No, m'lady.\"\r\n\r\nIt was discouraging. But Maud was a girl of pluck. You cannot leap\r\ninto strange cabs in Piccadilly unless you have pluck. She picked\r\nup another book from the stone seat.\r\n\r\n\"Read me some of this,\" she said, \"and then tell me if it doesn't\r\nmake you feel you want to do big things.\"\r\n\r\nAlbert took the book cautiously. He was getting a little fed up\r\nwith all this sort of thing. True, 'er ladyship gave him chocolates\r\nto eat during these sessions, but for all that it was too much like\r\nschool for his taste. He regarded the open page with disfavour.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Maud, closing her eyes. \"It's very beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nAlbert began. He had a husky voice, due, it is to be feared,\r\nto precocious cigarette smoking, and his enunciation was not as\r\ngood as it might have been.\r\n\r\n    \"Wiv' blekest morss the flower-ports\r\n      Was-I mean were-crusted one and orl;\r\n    Ther rusted niles fell from the knorts\r\n      That 'eld the pear to the garden-worll.\r\n    Ther broken sheds looked sed and stringe;\r\n      Unlifted was the clinking latch;\r\n      Weeded and worn their ancient thatch\r\n    Er-pon ther lownely moated gringe,\r\n      She only said 'Me life is dreary,\r\n        'E cometh not,' she said.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert rather liked this part. He was never happy in narrative\r\nunless it could be sprinkled with a plentiful supply of \"he said's\"\r\nand \"she said's.\" He finished with some gusto.\r\n\r\n    \"She said - I am aweary, aweary,\r\n     I would that I was dead.\"\r\n\r\nMaud had listened to this rendition of one of her most adored poems\r\nwith much the same feeling which a composer with an over-sensitive\r\near would suffer on hearing his pet opus assassinated by a\r\nschoolgirl. Albert, who was a willing lad and prepared, if such\r\nshould be her desire, to plough his way through the entire seven\r\nstanzas, began the second verse, but Maud gently took the book away\r\nfrom him. Enough was sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"Now, wouldn't you like to be able to write a wonderful thing like\r\nthat, Albert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not me, m'lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't like to be a poet when you grow up?\"\r\n\r\nAlbert shook his golden head.\r\n\r\n\"I want to be a butcher when I grow up, m'lady.\"\r\n\r\nMaud uttered a little cry.\r\n\r\n\"A butcher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yus, m'lady. Butchers earn good money,\" he said, a light of\r\nenthusiasm in his blue eyes, for he was now on his favourite\r\nsubject. \"You've got to 'ave meat, yer see, m'lady. It ain't like\r\npoetry, m'lady, which no one wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Albert,\" cried Maud faintly. \"Killing poor animals. Surely\r\nyou wouldn't like that?\"\r\n\r\nAlbert's eyes glowed softly, as might an acolyte's at the sight of\r\nthe censer.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Widgeon down at the 'ome farm,\" he murmured reverently, \"he\r\nsays, if I'm a good boy, 'e'll let me watch 'im kill a pig\r\nToosday.\"\r\n\r\nHe gazed out over the water-lilies, his thoughts far away. Maud\r\nshuddered. She wondered if medieval pages were ever quite as earthy\r\nas this.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you had better go now, Albert. They may be needing you in\r\nthe house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, m'lady.\"\r\n\r\nAlbert rose, not unwilling to call it a day. He was conscious of\r\nthe need for a quiet cigarette. He was fond of Maud, but a man\r\ncan't spend all his time with the women.\r\n\r\n\"Pigs squeal like billy-o, m'lady!\" he observed by way of adding a\r\nparting treasure to Maud's stock of general knowledge.  \"Oo! 'Ear\r\n'em a mile orf, you can!\"\r\n\r\nMaud remained where she was, thinking, a wistful figure.\r\nTennyson's \"Mariana\" always made her wistful even when rendered by\r\nAlbert. In the occasional moods of sentimental depression which\r\ncame to vary her normal cheerfulness, it seemed to her that the\r\npoem might have been written with a prophetic eye to her special\r\ncase, so nearly did it crystallize in magic words her own story.\r\n\r\n        \"With blackest moss the flower-pots\r\n         Were thickly crusted, one and all.\"\r\n\r\nWell, no, not that particular part, perhaps. If he had found so\r\nmuch as one flower-pot of his even thinly crusted with any foreign\r\nsubstance, Lord Marshmoreton would have gone through the place like\r\nan east wind, dismissing gardeners and under-gardeners with every\r\nbreath. But--\r\n\r\n         \"She only said 'My life is dreary,\r\n            He cometh not,' she said.\r\n         She said 'I am aweary, aweary.\r\n            I would that I were dead!\"\r\n\r\nHow exactly--at these moments when she was not out on the links\r\npicking them off the turf with a midiron or engaged in one of those\r\nother healthful sports which tend to take the mind off its\r\ntroubles--those words summed up her case.\r\n\r\nWhy didn't Geoffrey come? Or at least write? She could not write to\r\nhim. Letters from the castle left only by way of the castle\r\npost-bag, which Rogers, the chauffeur, took down to the village\r\nevery evening. Impossible to entrust the kind of letter she wished\r\nto write to any mode of delivery so public--especially now, when\r\nher movements were watched. To open and read another's letters is a\r\nlow and dastardly act, but she believed that Lady Caroline would do\r\nit like a shot. She longed to pour out her heart to Geoffrey in a\r\nlong, intimate letter, but she did not dare to take the risk of\r\nwriting for a wider public. Things were bad enough as it was, after\r\nthat disastrous sortie to London.\r\n\r\nAt this point a soothing vision came to her--the vision of George\r\nBevan knocking off her brother Percy's hat. It was the only\r\npleasant thing that had happened almost as far back as she could\r\nremember. And then, for the first time, her mind condescended to\r\ndwell for a moment on the author of that act, George Bevan, the\r\nfriend in need, whom she had met only the day before in the lane.\r\nWhat was George doing at Belpher?  His presence there was\r\nsignificant, and his words even more so. He had stated explicitly\r\nthat he wished to help her.\r\n\r\nShe found herself oppressed by the irony of things. A knight had\r\ncome to the rescue--but the wrong knight. Why could it not have\r\nbeen Geoffrey who waited in ambush outside the castle, and not a\r\npleasant but negligible stranger? Whether, deep down in her\r\nconsciousness, she was aware of a fleeting sense of disappointment\r\nin Geoffrey, a swiftly passing thought that he had failed her, she\r\ncould hardly have said, so quickly did she crush it down.\r\n\r\nShe pondered on the arrival of George. What was the use of his\r\nbeing somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing\r\nwhere she could find him? Situated as she was, she could not wander\r\nat will about the countryside, looking for him. And, even if she\r\nfound him, what then? There was not much that any stranger, however\r\npleasant, could do.\r\n\r\nShe flushed at a sudden thought. Of course there was something\r\nGeorge could do for her if he were willing. He could receive,\r\ndespatch and deliver letters. If only she could get in touch with\r\nhim, she could--through him--get in touch with Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nThe whole world changed for her. The sun was setting and chill\r\nlittle winds had begun to stir the lily-pads, giving a depressing\r\nair to the scene, but to Maud it seemed as if all Nature smiled.\r\nWith the egotism of love, she did not perceive that what she\r\nproposed to ask George to do was practically to fulfil the humble\r\nrole of the hollow tree in which lovers dump letters, to be\r\nextracted later; she did not consider George's feelings at all. He\r\nhad offered to help her, and this was his job. The world is full of\r\nGeorges whose task it is to hang about in the background and make\r\nthemselves unobtrusively useful.\r\n\r\nShe had reached this conclusion when Albert, who had taken a short\r\ncut the more rapidly to accomplish his errand, burst upon her\r\ndramatically from the heart of a rhododendron thicket.\r\n\r\n\"M'lady! Gentleman give me this to give yer!\"\r\n\r\nMaud read the note. It was brief, and to the point.\r\n\r\n    \"I am staying near the castle at a cottage they call 'the\r\n    one down by Platt's'. It is a rather new, red-brick place.\r\n    You can easily find it. I shall be waiting there if you want\r\n    me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was signed \"The Man in the Cab\".\r\n\r\n\"Do you know a cottage called 'the one down by Platt's', Albert?\"\r\nasked Maud.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, m'lady. It's down by Platt's farm. I see a chicken killed\r\nthere Wednesday week. Do you know, m'lady, after a chicken's 'ead\r\nis cut orf, it goes running licketty-split?\"\r\n\r\nMaud shivered slightly. Albert's fresh young enthusiasms frequently\r\njarred upon her.\r\n\r\n\"I find a friend of mine is staying there. I want you to take a\r\nnote to him from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, m'lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, Albert--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, m'lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it would be as well if you said nothing about this to any\r\nof your friends.\"\r\n\r\nIn Lord Marshmoreton's study a council of three was sitting in\r\ndebate. The subject under discussion was that other note which\r\nGeorge had written and so ill-advisedly entrusted to one whom he\r\nhad taken for a guileless gardener. The council consisted of Lord\r\nMarshmoreton, looking rather shamefaced, his son Percy looking\r\nswollen and serious, and Lady Caroline Byng, looking like a tragedy\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" Lord Belpher was saying in a determined voice, \"settles it.\r\nFrom now on Maud must not be allowed out of our sight.\"\r\n\r\nLord Marshmoreton spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I rather wish,\" he said regretfully, \"I hadn't spoken about the\r\nnote. I only mentioned it because I thought you might think it\r\namusing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amusing!\" Lady Caroline's voice shook the furniture.\r\n\r\n\"Amusing that the fellow should have handed me of all people a\r\nletter for Maud,\" explained her brother. \"I don't want to get Maud\r\ninto trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are criminally weak,\" said Lady Caroline severely. \"I really\r\nhonestly believe that you were capable of giving the note to that\r\npoor, misguided girl, and saying nothing about it.\" She flushed.\r\n\"The insolence of the man, coming here and settling down at the\r\nvery gates of the castle! If it was anybody but this man Platt who\r\nwas giving him shelter I should insist on his being turned out. But\r\nthat man Platt would be only too glad to know that he is causing us\r\nannoyance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite!\" said Lord Belpher.\r\n\r\n\"You must go to this man as soon as possible,\" continued Lady\r\nCaroline, fixing her brother with a commanding stare, \"and do your\r\nbest to make him see how abominable his behaviour is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I couldn't!\" pleaded the earl. \"I don't know the fellow. He'd\r\nthrow me out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. Go at the very earliest opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right, all right, all right. Well, I think I'll be\r\nslipping out to the rose garden again now. There's a clear hour\r\nbefore dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a tap at the door. Alice Faraday entered bearing papers,\r\na smile of sweet helpfulness on her pretty face.\r\n\r\n\"I hoped I should find you here, Lord Marshmoreton. You promised to\r\ngo over these notes with me, the ones about the Essex branch--\"\r\n\r\nThe hunted peer looked as if he were about to dive through the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\"Some other time, some other time. I--I have important matters--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you're busy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Lord Marshmoreton will be delighted to work on your\r\nnotes, Miss Faraday,\" said Lady Caroline crisply.  \"Take this\r\nchair. We are just going.\"\r\n\r\nLord Marshmoreton gave one wistful glance through the open window.\r\nThen he sat down with a sigh, and felt for his reading-glasses."
