    "Over this complex situation the mind of Keggs, the butler, played\r\nlike a searchlight. Keggs was a man of discernment and sagacity. He\r\nhad instinct and reasoning power. Instinct told him that Maud, all\r\nunsuspecting the change that had taken place in Albert's attitude\r\ntoward her romance, would have continued to use the boy as a link\r\nbetween herself and George:  and reason, added to an intimate\r\nknowledge of Albert, enabled him to see that the latter must\r\ninevitably have betrayed her trust. He was prepared to bet a\r\nhundred pounds that Albert had been given letters to deliver and\r\nhad destroyed them. So much was clear to Keggs. It only remained to\r\nsettle on some plan of action which would re-establish the broken\r\nconnection. Keggs did not conceal a tender heart beneath a rugged\r\nexterior: he did not mourn over the picture of two loving fellow\r\nhuman beings separated by a misunderstanding; but he did want to\r\nwin that sweepstake.\r\n\r\nHis position, of course, was delicate. He could not go to Maud and\r\nbeg her to confide in him. Maud would not understand his motives,\r\nand might leap to the not unjustifiable conclusion that he had been\r\nat the sherry. No! Men were easier to handle than women. As soon as\r\nhis duties would permit--and in the present crowded condition of\r\nthe house they were arduous--he set out for George's cottage.\r\n\r\n\"I trust I do not disturb or interrupt you, sir,\" he said, beaming\r\nin the doorway like a benevolent high priest. He had doffed his\r\nprofessional manner of austere disapproval, as was his custom in\r\nmoments of leisure.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" replied George, puzzled. \"Was there anything . . .?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along in and sit down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not take the liberty, if it is all the same to you, sir. I\r\nwould prefer to remain standing.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of uncomfortable silence. Uncomfortable, that is\r\nto say, on the part of George, who was wondering if the butler\r\nremembered having engaged him as a waiter only a few nights back.\r\nKeggs himself was at his ease. Few things ruffled this man.\r\n\r\n\"Fine day,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Extremely, sir, but for the rain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it raining?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sharp downpour, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for the crops,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"So one would be disposed to imagine, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSilence fell again. The rain dripped from the eaves.\r\n\r\n\"If I might speak freely, sir . . .?\" said Keggs.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Shoot!\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, yes. Go ahead!\"\r\n\r\nThe butler cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Might I begin by remarking that your little affair of the 'eart,\r\nif I may use the expression, is no secret in the Servants' 'All? I\r\n'ave no wish to seem to be taking a liberty or presuming, but I\r\nshould like to intimate that the Servants' 'All is aware of the\r\nfacts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't have to tell me that,\" said George coldly. \"I know all\r\nabout the sweepstake.\"\r\n\r\nA flicker of embarrassment passed over the butler's large, smooth\r\nface--passed, and was gone.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know that you 'ad been apprised of that little matter,\r\nsir. But you will doubtless understand and appreciate our point of\r\nview. A little sporting flutter--nothing more--designed to\r\nhalleviate the monotony of life in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't apologize,\" said George, and was reminded of a point\r\nwhich had exercised him a little from time to time since his vigil\r\non the balcony. \"By the way, if it isn't giving away secrets, who\r\ndrew Plummer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which of you drew a man named Plummer in the sweep?\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather fancy, sir,\" Keggs' brow wrinkled in thought, \"I rather\r\nfancy it was one of the visiting gentlemen's gentlemen. I gave the\r\npoint but slight attention at the time. I did not fancy Mr.\r\nPlummer's chances. It seemed to me that Mr. Plummer was a\r\nnegligible quantity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your knowledge of form was sound. Plummer's out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir! An amiable young gentleman, but lacking in many of\r\nthe essential qualities. Perhaps he struck you that way, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never met him. Nearly, but not quite!\"\r\n\r\n\"It entered my mind that you might possibly have encountered Mr.\r\nPlummer on the night of the ball, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I was wondering if you remembered me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember you perfectly, sir, and it was the fact that we had\r\nalready met in what one might almost term a social way that\r\nemboldened me to come 'ere today and offer you my services as a\r\nhintermediary, should you feel disposed to avail yourself of them.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Your services?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, sir. I fancy I am in a position to lend you what might\r\nbe termed an 'elping 'and.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's remarkably altruistic of you, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say that is very generous of you. Aren't you forgetting that you\r\ndrew Mr. Byng?\"\r\n\r\nThe butler smiled indulgently.\r\n\r\n\"You are not quite abreast of the progress of events, sir. Since\r\nthe original drawing of names, there 'as been a trifling\r\nhadjustment. The boy Albert now 'as Mr. Byng and I 'ave you, sir. A\r\nlittle amicable arrangement informally conducted in the scullery on\r\nthe night of the ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amicable?\"\r\n\r\n\"On my part, entirely so.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge began to understand certain things that had been perplexing\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"Then all this while. . .?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, sir. All this while 'er ladyship, under the impression\r\nthat the boy Albert was devoted to 'er cause, has no doubt been\r\nplacing a misguided confidence in 'im . . . The little blighter!\"\r\nsaid Keggs, abandoning for a moment his company manners and\r\npermitting vehemence to take the place of polish. \"I beg your\r\npardon for the expression, sir,\" he added gracefully. \"It escaped\r\nme inadvertently.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think that Lady Maud gave Albert a letter to give to me, and\r\nthat he destroyed it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such, I should imagine, must undoubtedly have been the case. The\r\nboy 'as no scruples, no scruples whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate your consternation, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must be exactly what has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"To my way of thinking there is no doubt of it. It was for that\r\nreason that I ventured to come 'ere. In the 'ope that I might be\r\nhinstrumental in arranging a meeting.\"\r\n\r\nThe strong distaste which George had had for plotting with this\r\noverfed menial began to wane. It might be undignified, he told\r\nhimself but it was undeniably practical. And, after all, a man who\r\nhas plotted with page-boys has little dignity to lose by plotting\r\nwith butlers. He brightened up. If it meant seeing Maud again he\r\nwas prepared to waive the decencies.\r\n\r\n\"What do you suggest?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It being a rainy evening and everyone indoors playing games and\r\nwhat not,\"--Keggs was amiably tolerant of the recreations of the\r\naristocracy--\"you would experience little chance of a hinterruption,\r\nwere you to proceed to the lane outside the heast entrance of the\r\ncastle grounds and wait there. You will find in the field at the\r\nroadside a small disused barn only a short way from the gates, where\r\nyou would be sheltered from the rain. In the meantime, I would\r\nhinform 'er ladyship of your movements, and no doubt it would be\r\npossible for 'er to slip off.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all right, sir. The chances of a hinterruption may be said\r\nto be reduced to a minimum. Shall we say in one hour's time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will wish you good evening, sir. Thank you, sir. I am glad\r\nto 'ave been of assistance.\"\r\n\r\nHe withdrew as he had come, with a large impressiveness. The room\r\nseemed very empty without him. George, with trembling fingers,\r\nbegan to put on a pair of thick boots.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes after he had set foot outside the door of the\r\ncottage, George was inclined to revile the weather for having\r\nplayed him false. On this evening of all evenings, he felt, the\r\nelements should, so to speak, have rallied round and done their\r\nbit. The air should have been soft and clear and scented: there\r\nshould have been an afterglow of sunset in the sky to light him on\r\nhis way. Instead, the air was full of that peculiar smell of\r\nhopeless dampness which comes at the end of a wet English day. The\r\nsky was leaden. The rain hissed down in a steady flow, whispering\r\nof mud and desolation, making a dreary morass of the lane through\r\nwhich he tramped. A curious sense of foreboding came upon George.\r\nIt was as if some voice of the night had murmured maliciously in\r\nhis ear a hint of troubles to come. He felt oddly nervous, as he\r\nentered the barn.\r\n\r\nThe barn was both dark and dismal. In one of the dark corners an\r\nintermittent dripping betrayed the presence of a gap in its ancient\r\nroof. A rat scurried across the floor. The dripping stopped and\r\nbegan again. George struck a match and looked at his watch. He was\r\nearly. Another ten minutes must elapse before he could hope for her\r\narrival. He sat down on a broken wagon which lay on its side\r\nagainst one of the walls.\r\n\r\nDepression returned. It was impossible to fight against it in this\r\nbeast of a barn. The place was like a sepulchre. No one but a fool\r\nof a butler would have suggested it as a trysting-place. He\r\nwondered irritably why places like this were allowed to get into\r\nthis condition. If people wanted a barn earnestly enough to take\r\nthe trouble of building one, why was it not worth while to keep the\r\nthing in proper repair? Waste and futility! That was what it was.\r\nThat was what everything was, if you came down to it. Sitting here,\r\nfor instance, was a futile waste of time. She wouldn't come. There\r\nwere a dozen reasons why she should not come. So what was the use\r\nof his courting rheumatism by waiting in this morgue of dead\r\nagricultural ambitions? None whatever--George went on waiting.\r\n\r\nAnd what an awful place to expect her to come to, if by some miracle\r\nshe did come--where she would be stifled by the smell of mouldy hay,\r\ndamped by raindrops and--reflected George gloomily as there was\r\nanother scurry and scutter along the unseen floor--gnawed by rats.\r\nYou could not expect a delicately-nurtured girl, accustomed to all\r\nthe comforts of a home, to be bright and sunny with a platoon of\r\nrats crawling all over her. . . .\r\n\r\nThe grey oblong that was the doorway suddenly darkened.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bevan!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge sprang up. At the sound of her voice every nerve in his body\r\ndanced in mad exhilaration. He was another man. Depression fell\r\nfrom him like a garment. He perceived that he had misjudged all\r\nsorts of things. The evening, for instance, was a splendid\r\nevening--not one of those awful dry, baking evenings which make you\r\nfeel you can't breathe, but pleasantly moist and full of a\r\ndelightfully musical patter of rain. And the barn! He had been all\r\nwrong about the barn. It was a great little place, comfortable,\r\nairy, and cheerful. What could be more invigorating than that smell\r\nof hay? Even the rats, he felt, must be pretty decent rats, when\r\nyou came to know them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm here!\"\r\n\r\nMaud advanced quickly. His eyes had grown accustomed to the murk,\r\nand he could see her dimly. The smell of her damp raincoat came to\r\nhim like a breath of ozone. He could even see her eyes shining in\r\nthe darkness, so close was she to him.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you've not been waiting long?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge's heart was thundering against his ribs. He could scarcely\r\nspeak. He contrived to emit a No.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think at first I could get away. I had to . . .\" She\r\nbroke off with a cry. The rat, fond of exercise like all rats, had\r\nmade another of its excitable sprints across the floor.\r\n\r\nA hand clutched nervously at George's arm, found it and held it.\r\nAnd at the touch the last small fragment of George's self-control\r\nfled from him. The world became vague and unreal. There remained\r\nof it but one solid fact--the fact that Maud was in his arms and\r\nthat he was saying a number of things very rapidly in a voice that\r\nseemed to belong to somebody he had never met before."
