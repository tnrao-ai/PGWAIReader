    "\"Young blighted Albert,\" said Keggs the butler, shifting his weight\r\nso that it distributed itself more comfortably over the creaking\r\nchair in which he reclined, \"let this be a lesson to you, young\r\nfeller me lad.\"\r\n\r\nThe day was a week after Lord Marshmoreton's visit to London, the\r\nhour six o'clock. The housekeeper's room, in which the upper\r\nservants took their meals, had emptied. Of the gay company which\r\nhad just finished dinner only Keggs remained, placidly digesting.\r\nAlbert, whose duty it was to wait on the upper servants, was moving\r\nto and fro, morosely collecting the plates and glasses. The boy was\r\nin no happy frame of mind. Throughout dinner the conversation at\r\ntable had dealt almost exclusively with the now celebrated\r\nelopement of Reggie Byng and his bride, and few subjects could have\r\nmade more painful listening to Albert.\r\n\r\n\"What's been the result and what I might call the upshot,\" said\r\nKeggs, continuing his homily, \"of all your making yourself so busy\r\nand thrusting of yourself forward and meddling in the affairs of\r\nyour elders and betters? The upshot and issue of it 'as been that\r\nyou are out five shillings and nothing to show for it. Five\r\nshillings what you might have spent on some good book and improved\r\nyour mind! And goodness knows it wants all the improving it can\r\nget, for of all the worthless, idle little messers it's ever been\r\nmy misfortune to have dealings with, you are the champion. Be\r\ncareful of them plates, young man, and don't breathe so hard. You\r\n'aven't got hasthma or something, 'ave you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't breathe now!\" complained the stricken child.\r\n\r\n\"Not like a grampus you can't, and don't you forget it.\" Keggs\r\nwagged his head reprovingly. \"Well, so your Reggie Byng's gone and\r\neloped, has he! That ought to teach you to be more careful another\r\ntime 'ow you go gambling and plunging into sweepstakes. The idea of\r\na child of your age 'aving the audacity to thrust 'isself forward\r\nlike that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't call him my Reggie Byng! I didn't draw 'im!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no need to go into all that again, young feller. You\r\naccepted 'im freely and without prejudice when the fair exchange\r\nwas suggested, so for all practical intents and purposes he is your\r\nReggie Byng. I 'ope you're going to send him a wedding-present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you ain't any better off than me, with all your 'ighway\r\nrobbery!\"\r\n\r\n\"My what!\"\r\n\r\n\"You 'eard what I said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't let me 'ear it again. The idea! If you 'ad any\r\nobjections to parting with that ticket, you should have stated them\r\nclearly at the time. And what do you mean by saying I ain't any\r\nbetter off than you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"I 'ave my reasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think you 'ave, which is a very different thing. I suppose you\r\nimagine that you've put a stopper on a certain little affair by\r\nsurreptitiously destroying letters entrusted to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never!\" exclaimed Albert with a convulsive start that nearly\r\nsent eleven plates dashing to destruction.\r\n\r\n\"'Ow many times have I got to tell you to be careful of them\r\nplates?\" said Keggs sternly. \"Who do you think you are--a juggler\r\non the 'Alls, 'urling them about like that? Yes, I know all about\r\nthat letter. You thought you was very clever, I've no doubt. But\r\nlet me tell you, young blighted Albert, that only the other evening\r\n'er ladyship and Mr. Bevan 'ad a long and extended interview in\r\nspite of all your hefforts. I saw through your little game, and I\r\nproceeded and went and arranged the meeting.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself Albert was awed. He was oppressed by the sense\r\nof struggling with a superior intellect.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you did!\" he managed to say with the proper note of\r\nincredulity, but in his heart he was not incredulous. Dimly, Albert\r\nhad begun to perceive that years must elapse before he could become\r\ncapable of matching himself in battles of wits with this\r\nmaster-strategist.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I certainly did!\" said Keggs. \"I don't know what 'appened at\r\nthe interview--not being present in person. But I've no doubt that\r\neverything proceeded satisfactorily.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a fat lot of good that's going to do you, when 'e ain't\r\nallowed to come inside the 'ouse!\"\r\n\r\nA bland smile irradiated the butler's moon-like face.\r\n\r\n\"If by 'e you're alloodin' to Mr. Bevan, young blighted Albert, let\r\nme tell you that it won't be long before 'e becomes a regular duly\r\ninvited guest at the castle!\"\r\n\r\n\"A lot of chance!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you care to 'ave another five shillings even money on it?\"\r\n\r\nAlbert recoiled. He had had enough of speculation where the butler\r\nwas concerned. Where that schemer was allowed to get within reach\r\nof it, hard cash melted away.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind what I'm going to do. I 'ave my methods. All I\r\n'ave to say to you is that tomorrow or the day after Mr. Bevan\r\nwill be seated in our dining-'all with 'is feet under our table,\r\nreplying according to his personal taste and preference, when I ask\r\n'im if 'e'll 'ave 'ock or sherry. Brush all them crumbs carefully\r\noff the tablecloth, young blighted Albert--don't shuffle your\r\nfeet--breathe softly through your nose--and close the door be'ind\r\nyou when you've finished!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, go and eat cake!\" said Albert bitterly. But he said\r\nit to his immortal soul, not aloud. The lad's spirit was broken.\r\n\r\nKeggs, the processes of digestion completed, presented himself\r\nbefore Lord Belpher in the billiard-room. Percy was alone. The\r\nhouse-party, so numerous on the night of the ball and on his\r\nbirthday, had melted down now to reasonable proportions. The\r\nsecond and third cousins had retired, flushed and gratified, to\r\nobscure dens from which they had emerged, and the castle housed\r\nonly the more prominent members of the family, always harder to\r\ndislodge than the small fry. The Bishop still remained, and the\r\nColonel. Besides these, there were perhaps half a dozen more of the\r\ncloser relations: to Lord Belpher's way of thinking, half a dozen\r\ntoo many. He was not fond of his family.\r\n\r\n\"Might I have a word with your lordship?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Keggs?\"\r\n\r\nKeggs was a self-possessed man, but he found it a little hard to\r\nbegin. Then he remembered that once in the misty past he had seen\r\nLord Belpher spanked for stealing jam, he himself having acted on\r\nthat occasion as prosecuting attorney; and the memory nerved him.\r\n\r\n\"I earnestly 'ope that your lordship will not think that I am\r\ntaking a liberty. I 'ave been in his lordship your father's service\r\nmany years now, and the family honour is, if I may be pardoned for\r\nsaying so, extremely near my 'eart. I 'ave known your lordship\r\nsince you were a mere boy, and . . .\"\r\n\r\nLord Belpher had listened with growing impatience to this preamble.\r\nHis temper was seldom at its best these days, and the rolling\r\nperiods annoyed him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" he said. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\nKeggs was himself now. In his opening remarks he had simply been,\r\nas it were, winding up. He was now prepared to begin.\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship will recall inquiring of me on the night of the ball\r\nas to the bona fides of one of the temporary waiters? The one that\r\nstated that 'e was the cousin of young bli--of the boy Albert, the\r\npage? I have been making inquiries, your lordship, and I regret to\r\nsay I find that the man was a impostor. He informed me that 'e was\r\nAlbert's cousin, but Albert now informs me that 'e 'as no cousin in\r\nAmerica. I am extremely sorry this should have occurred, your\r\nlordship, and I 'ope you will attribute it to the bustle and haste\r\ninseparable from duties as mine on such a occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the fellow was an impostor. He was probably after the\r\nspoons!\"\r\n\r\nKeggs coughed.\r\n\r\n\"If I might be allowed to take a further liberty, your lordship,\r\nmight I suggest that I am aware of the man's identity and of his\r\nmotive for visiting the castle.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited a little apprehensively. This was the crucial point in\r\nthe interview. If Lord Belpher did not now freeze him with a glance\r\nand order him from the room, the danger would be past, and he could\r\nspeak freely. His light blue eyes were expressionless as they met\r\nPercy's, but inwardly he was feeling much the same sensation as he\r\nwas wont to experience when the family was in town and he had\r\nmanaged to slip off to Kempton Park or some other race-course and\r\nput some of his savings on a horse. As he felt when the racing\r\nsteeds thundered down the straight, so did he feel now.\r\n\r\nAstonishment showed in Lord Belpher's round face. Just as it was\r\nabout to be succeeded by indignation, the butler spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"I am aware, your lordship, that it is not my place to offer\r\nsuggestions as to the private and intimate affairs of the family I\r\n'ave the honour to serve, but, if your lordship would consent to\r\noverlook the liberty, I think I could be of 'elp and assistance in\r\na matter which is causing annoyance and unpleasantness to all.\"\r\n\r\nHe invigorated himself with another dip into the waters of memory.\r\nYes. The young man before him might be Lord Belpher, son of his\r\nemployer and heir to all these great estates, but once he had seen\r\nhim spanked.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Percy also remembered this. Perhaps he merely felt that\r\nKeggs was a faithful old servant and, as such, entitled to thrust\r\nhimself into the family affairs. Whatever his reasons, he now\r\ndefinitely lowered the barrier.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, with a glance at the door to make sure that there\r\nwere no witnesses to an act of which the aristocrat in him\r\ndisapproved, \"go on!\"\r\n\r\nKeggs breathed freely. The danger-point was past.\r\n\r\n\"'Aving a natural interest, your lordship,\" he said, \"we of the\r\nServants' 'All generally manage to become respectfully aware of\r\nwhatever 'appens to be transpirin' above stairs. May I say that I\r\nbecame acquainted at an early stage with the trouble which your\r\nlordship is unfortunately 'aving with a certain party?\"\r\n\r\nLord Belpher, although his whole being revolted against what\r\npractically amounted to hobnobbing with a butler, perceived that he\r\nhad committed himself to the discussion. It revolted him to think\r\nthat these delicate family secrets were the subject of conversation\r\nin menial circles, but it was too late to do anything now. And\r\nsuch was the whole-heartedness with which he had declared war upon\r\nGeorge Bevan that, at this stage in the proceedings, his chief\r\nemotion was a hope that Keggs might have something sensible to\r\nsuggest.\r\n\r\n\"I think, begging your lordship's pardon for making the remark,\r\nthat you are acting injudicious. I 'ave been in service a great\r\nnumber of years, startin' as steward's room boy and rising to my\r\npresent position, and I may say I 'ave 'ad experience during those\r\nyears of several cases where the daughter or son of the 'ouse\r\ncontemplated a misalliance, and all but one of the cases ended\r\ndisastrously, your lordship, on account of the family trying\r\nopposition. It is my experience that opposition in matters of the\r\n'eart is useless, feedin', as it, so to speak, does the flame.\r\nYoung people, your lordship, if I may be pardoned for employing the\r\nexpression in the present case, are naturally romantic and if you\r\nkeep 'em away from a thing they sit and pity themselves and want it\r\nall the more. And in the end you may be sure they get it. There's\r\nno way of stoppin' them. I was not on sufficiently easy terms with\r\nthe late Lord Worlingham to give 'im the benefit of my experience\r\non the occasion when the Honourable Aubrey Pershore fell in love\r\nwith the young person at the Gaiety Theatre. Otherwise I could\r\n'ave told 'im he was not acting judicious. His lordship opposed\r\nthe match in every way, and the young couple ran off and got\r\nmarried at a registrar's. It was the same when a young man who was\r\ntutor to 'er ladyship's brother attracted Lady Evelyn Walls, the\r\nonly daughter of the Earl of Ackleton. In fact, your lordship, the\r\nonly entanglement of the kind that came to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion in the whole of my personal experience was the affair of\r\nLady Catherine Duseby, Lord Bridgefield's daughter, who\r\ninjudiciously became infatuated with a roller-skating instructor.\"\r\n\r\nLord Belpher had ceased to feel distantly superior to his companion.\r\nThe butler's powerful personality hypnotized him. Long ere the\r\nharangue was ended, he was as a little child drinking in the\r\nutterances of a master. He bent forward eagerly. Keggs had broken\r\noff his remarks at the most interesting point.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" inquired Percy.\r\n\r\n\"The young man,\" proceeded Keggs, \"was a young man of considerable\r\npersonal attractions, 'aving large brown eyes and a athletic\r\nlissome figure, brought about by roller-skating. It was no wonder,\r\nin the opinion of the Servants' 'All, that 'er ladyship should have\r\nfound 'erself fascinated by him, particularly as I myself 'ad 'eard\r\nher observe at a full luncheon-table that roller-skating was in\r\nher opinion the only thing except her toy Pomeranian that made life\r\nworth living. But when she announced that she had become engaged to\r\nthis young man, there was the greatest consternation. I was not, of\r\ncourse, privileged to be a participant at the many councils and\r\ndiscussions that ensued and took place, but I was aware that such\r\ntranspired with great frequency. Eventually 'is lordship took the\r\nshrewd step of assuming acquiescence and inviting the young man to\r\nvisit us in Scotland. And within ten days of his arrival, your\r\nlordship, the match was broken off. He went back to 'is\r\nroller-skating, and 'er ladyship took up visiting the poor and\r\neventually contracted an altogether suitable alliance by marrying\r\nLord Ronald Spofforth, the second son of his Grace the Duke of\r\nGorbals and Strathbungo.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seein' the young man in the surroundings of 'er own 'ome, 'er\r\nladyship soon began to see that she had taken too romantic a view\r\nof 'im previous, your lordship. 'E was one of the lower middle\r\nclass, what is sometimes termed the bourjoisy, and 'is 'abits were\r\nnot the 'abits of the class to which 'er ladyship belonged. 'E 'ad\r\nnothing in common with the rest of the 'ouse-party, and was\r\ninjudicious in 'is choice of forks. The very first night at dinner\r\n'e took a steel knife to the ontray, and I see 'er ladyship look at\r\nhim very sharp, as much as to say that scales had fallen from 'er\r\neyes. It didn't take 'er long after that to become convinced that\r\n'er 'eart 'ad led 'er astray.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think--?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not for me to presume to offer anything but the most\r\nrespectful advice, your lordship, but I should most certainly\r\nadvocate a similar procedure in the present instance.\"\r\n\r\nLord Belpher reflected. Recent events had brought home to him the\r\nmagnitude of the task he had assumed when he had appointed himself\r\nthe watcher of his sister's movements. The affair of the curate and\r\nthe village blacksmith had shaken him both physically and\r\nspiritually. His feet were still sore, and his confidence in\r\nhimself had waned considerably. The thought of having to continue\r\nhis espionage indefinitely was not a pleasant one. How much simpler\r\nand more effective it would be to adopt the suggestion which had\r\nbeen offered to him.\r\n\r\n\"--I'm not sure you aren't right, Keggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, your lordship. I feel convinced of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will speak to my father tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, your lordship. I am glad to have been of service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young blighted Albert,\" said Keggs crisply, shortly after\r\nbreakfast on the following morning, \"you're to take this note to\r\nMr. Bevan at the cottage down by Platt's farm, and you're to\r\ndeliver it without playing any of your monkey-tricks, and you're to\r\nwait for an answer, and you're to bring that answer back to me,\r\ntoo, and to Lord Marshmoreton. And I may tell you, to save you the\r\ntrouble of opening it with steam from the kitchen kettle, that I\r\n'ave already done so. It's an invitation to dine with us tonight.\r\nSo now you know. Look slippy!\"\r\n\r\nAlbert capitulated. For the first time in his life he felt humble.\r\nHe perceived how misguided he had been ever to suppose that he\r\ncould pit his pigmy wits against this smooth-faced worker of\r\nwonders.\r\n\r\n\"Crikey!\" he ejaculated.\r\n\r\nIt was all that he could say.\r\n\r\n\"And there's one more thing, young feller me lad,\" added Keggs\r\nearnestly, \"don't you ever grow up to be such a fat'ead as our\r\nfriend Percy. Don't forget I warned you.\""
