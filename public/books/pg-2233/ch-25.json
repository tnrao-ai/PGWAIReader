    "\"I was never so upset in my life!\" said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nShe had been saying the same thing and many other things for the\r\npast five minutes. Until the departure of the last guest she had\r\nkept an icy command of herself and shown an unruffled front to the\r\nworld. She had even contrived to smile. But now, with the final\r\nautomobile whirring homewards, she had thrown off the mask. The\r\nvery furniture of Lord Marshmoreton's study seemed to shrink, seared\r\nby the flame of her wrath. As for Lord Marshmoreton himself, he\r\nlooked quite shrivelled.\r\n\r\nIt had not been an easy matter to bring her erring brother to bay.\r\nThe hunt had been in progress full ten minutes before she and Lord\r\nBelpher finally cornered the poor wretch. His plea, through the\r\nkeyhole of the locked door, that he was working on the family\r\nhistory and could not be disturbed, was ignored; and now he was\r\nface to face with the avengers.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand it,\" continued Lady Caroline. \"You know that\r\nfor months we have all been straining every nerve to break off this\r\nhorrible entanglement, and, just as we had begun to hope that\r\nsomething might be done, you announce the engagement in the most\r\npublic manner. I think you must be out of your mind. I can hardly\r\nbelieve even now that this appalling thing has happened. I am\r\nhoping that I shall wake up and find it is all a nightmare. How you\r\ncan have done such a thing, I cannot understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite!\" said Lord Belpher.\r\n\r\nIf Lady Caroline was upset, there are no words in the language that\r\nwill adequately describe the emotions of Percy.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start of this lamentable episode in high life, Percy\r\nhad been in the forefront of the battle. It was Percy who had had\r\nhis best hat smitten from his head in the full view of all\r\nPiccadilly. It was Percy who had suffered arrest and imprisonment\r\nin the cause. It was Percy who had been crippled for days owing to\r\nhis zeal in tracking Maud across country. And now all his\r\nsufferings were in vain. He had been betrayed by his own father.\r\n\r\nThere was, so the historians of the Middle West tell us, a man of\r\nChicago named Young, who once, when his nerves were unstrung, put\r\nhis mother (unseen) in the chopping-machine, and canned her and\r\nlabelled her \"Tongue\". It is enough to say that the glance of\r\ndisapproval which Percy cast upon his father at this juncture would\r\nhave been unduly severe if cast by the Young offspring upon their\r\nparent at the moment of confession.\r\n\r\nLord Marshmoreton had rallied from his initial panic. The spirit of\r\nrevolt began to burn again in his bosom. Once the die is cast for\r\nrevolution, there can be no looking back. One must defy, not\r\napologize. Perhaps the inherited tendencies of a line of ancestors\r\nwho, whatever their shortcomings, had at least known how to treat\r\ntheir women folk, came to his aid. Possibly there stood by his side\r\nin this crisis ghosts of dead and buried Marshmoretons, whispering\r\nspectral encouragement in his ear--the ghosts, let us suppose, of\r\nthat earl who, in the days of the seventh Henry, had stabbed his\r\nwife with a dagger to cure her tendency to lecture him at night; or\r\nof that other earl who, at a previous date in the annals of the\r\nfamily, had caused two aunts and a sister to be poisoned apparently\r\nfrom a mere whim. At any rate, Lord Marshmoreton produced from\r\nsome source sufficient courage to talk back.\r\n\r\n\"Silly nonsense!\" he grunted. \"Don't see what you're making all\r\nthis fuss about. Maud loves the fellow. I like the fellow.\r\nPerfectly decent fellow. Nothing to make a fuss about. Why\r\nshouldn't I announce the engagement?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be mad!\" cried Lady Caroline. \"Your only daughter and a\r\nman nobody knows anything about!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite!\" said Percy.\r\n\r\nLord Marshmoreton seized his advantage with the skill of an adroit\r\ndebater.\r\n\r\n\"That's where you're wrong. I know all about him. He's a very rich\r\nman. You heard the way all those people at dinner behaved when they\r\nheard his name. Very celebrated man!  Makes thousands of pounds a\r\nyear. Perfectly suitable match in every way.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not a suitable match,\" said Lady Caroline vehemently.  \"I\r\ndon't care whether this Mr. Bevan makes thousands of pounds a year\r\nor twopence-ha'penny. The match is not suitable. Money is not\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\nShe broke off. A knock had come on the door. The door opened, and\r\nBillie Dore came in. A kind-hearted girl, she had foreseen that\r\nLord Marshmoreton might be glad of a change of subject at about\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like me to help you tonight?\" she asked brightly.  \"I\r\nthought I would ask if there was anything you wanted me to do.\"\r\n\r\nLady Caroline snatched hurriedly at her aristocratic calm. She\r\nresented the interruption acutely, but her manner, when she spoke,\r\nwas bland.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Marshmoreton will not require your help tonight,\" she said.\r\n\"He will not be working.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" said Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" said Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nPercy scowled a valediction.\r\n\r\n\"Money,\" resumed Lady Caroline, \"is immaterial. Maud is in no\r\nposition to be obliged to marry a rich man. What makes the thing\r\nimpossible is that Mr. Bevan is nobody. He comes from nowhere. He\r\nhas no social standing whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't see it,\" said Lord Marshmoreton. \"The fellow's a thoroughly\r\ndecent fellow. That's all that matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you be so pig-headed! You are talking like an imbecile.\r\nYour secretary, Miss Dore, is a nice girl. But how would you feel\r\nif Percy were to come to you and say that he was engaged to be\r\nmarried to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" said Percy. \"Quite!\"\r\n\r\nLord Marshmoreton rose and moved to the door. He did it with a\r\ncertain dignity, but there was a strange hunted expression in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"That would be impossible,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said his sister. \"I am glad that you admit it.\"\r\n\r\nLord Marshmoreton had reached the door, and was standing holding\r\nthe handle. He seemed to gather strength from its support.\r\n\r\n\"I've been meaning to tell you about that,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"About what?\"\r\n\r\n\"About Miss Dore. I married her myself last Wednesday,\" said Lord\r\nMarshmoreton, and disappeared like a diving duck."
