    "\"Well, that's that!\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so much obliged,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"It was a pleasure,\" said George.\r\n\r\nHe was enabled now to get a closer, more leisurely and much more\r\nsatisfactory view of this distressed damsel than had been his good\r\nfortune up to the present. Small details which, when he had first\r\ncaught sight of her, distance had hidden from his view, now\r\npresented themselves. Her eyes, he discovered, which he had\r\nsupposed brown, were only brown in their general colour-scheme.\r\nThey were shot with attractive little flecks of gold, matching\r\nperfectly the little streaks of gold which the sun, coming out again\r\non one of his flying visits and now shining benignantly once more on\r\nthe world, revealed in her hair. Her chin was square and\r\ndetermined, but its resoluteness was contradicted by a dimple and\r\nby the pleasant good-humour of the mouth; and a further softening\r\nof the face was effected by the nose, which seemed to have started\r\nout with the intention of being dignified and aristocratic but had\r\ndefeated its purpose by tilting very slightly at the tip. This was\r\na girl who would take chances, but would take them with a smile and\r\nlaugh when she lost.\r\n\r\nGeorge was but an amateur physiognomist, but he could read what was\r\nobvious in the faces he encountered; and the more he looked at this\r\ngirl, the less he was able to understand the scene which had just\r\noccurred. The thing mystified him completely. For all her\r\ngood-humour, there was an air, a manner, a something capable and\r\ndefensive, about this girl with which he could not imagine any man\r\nventuring to take liberties. The gold-brown eyes, as they met his\r\nnow, were friendly and smiling, but he could imagine them freezing\r\ninto a stare baleful enough and haughty enough to quell such a\r\nperson as the silk-hatted young man with a single glance. Why,\r\nthen, had that super-fatted individual been able to demoralize her\r\nto the extent of flying to the shelter of strange cabs? She was\r\ncomposed enough now, it was true, but it had been quite plain that\r\nat the moment when she entered the taxi her nerve had momentarily\r\nforsaken her. There were mysteries here, beyond George.\r\n\r\nThe girl looked steadily at George and George looked steadily at\r\nher for the space of perhaps ten seconds. She seemed to George to\r\nbe summing him up, weighing him. That the inspection proved\r\nsatisfactory was shown by the fact that at the end of this period\r\nshe smiled. Then she laughed, a clear pealing laugh which to George\r\nwas far more musical than the most popular song-hit he had ever\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are wondering what it's all about?\" she said.\r\n\r\nThis was precisely what George was wondering most consumedly.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" he said. \"Not at all. It's not my business.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of course you're much too well bred to be inquisitive about\r\nother people's business?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am. What was it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what am I to say to the cabman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. What do men usually say to cabmen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean he will feel very hurt if I don't give him a full\r\nexplanation of all this. He stooped from his pedestal to make\r\nenquiries just now. Condescension like that deserves some\r\nrecognition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give him a nice big tip.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was reminded of his reason for being in the cab.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to have asked before,\" he said. \"Where can I drive you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I mustn't steal your cab. Where were you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going back to my hotel. I came out without any money, so I\r\nshall have to go there first to get some.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl started.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked George.\r\n\r\n\"I've lost my purse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord! Had it much in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very much. But enough to buy a ticket home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any use asking where that is?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't going to, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not. That's what I admire so much in you. You aren't\r\ninquisitive.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge reflected.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one thing to be done. You will have to wait in the\r\ncab at the hotel, while I go and get some money. Then, if you'll\r\nlet me, I can lend you what you require.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's much too kind of you. Could you manage eleven shillings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easily. I've just had a legacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if you think I ought to be economical, I'll go\r\nthird-class. That would only be five shillings. Ten-and-six is the\r\nfirst-class fare. So you see the place I want to get to is two\r\nhours from London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's something to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not much, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I had better lend you a sovereign. Then you'll be able to\r\nbuy a lunch-basket.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think of everything. And you're perfectly right. I shall be\r\nstarving. But how do you know you will get the money back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll risk it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I shall have to be inquisitive and ask your name.\r\nOtherwise I shan't know where to send the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's no mystery about me. I'm an open book.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be horrid about it. I can't help being mysterious.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounded as if you did. Well, who is my benefactor?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is George Bevan. I am staying at the Carlton at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll remember.\"\r\n\r\nThe taxi moved slowly down the Haymarket. The girl laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"I was only thinking of back there. You know, I haven't thanked you\r\nnearly enough for all you did. You were wonderful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very glad I was able to be of any help.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did happen? You must remember I couldn't see a thing except\r\nyour back, and I could only hear indistinctly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it started by a man galloping up and insisting that you had\r\ngot into the cab. He was a fellow with the appearance of a\r\nbefore-using advertisement of an anti-fat medicine and the manners\r\nof a ring-tailed chimpanzee.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Then it was Percy! I knew I wasn't mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Percy?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is his name.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be! I could have betted on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reasoned with the man, but didn't seem to soothe him, and\r\nfinally he made a grab for the door-handle, so I knocked off his\r\nhat, and while he was retrieving it we moved on and escaped.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl gave another silver peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a shame I couldn't see it. But how resourceful of you!\r\nHow did you happen to think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It just came to me,\" said George modestly.\r\n\r\nA serious look came into the girl's face. The smile died out of her\r\neyes. She shivered.\r\n\r\n\"When I think how some men might have behaved in your place!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. Any man would have done just what I did. Surely, knocking\r\noff Percy's hat was an act of simple courtesy which anyone would\r\nhave performed automatically!\"\r\n\r\n\"You might have been some awful bounder. Or, what would have been\r\nalmost worse, a slow-witted idiot who would have stopped to ask\r\nquestions before doing anything. To think I should have had the\r\nluck to pick you out of all London!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been looking on it as a piece of luck--but entirely from my\r\nviewpoint.\"\r\n\r\nShe put a small hand on his arm, and spoke earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bevan, you mustn't think that, because I've been laughing a\r\ngood deal and have seemed to treat all this as a joke, you haven't\r\nsaved me from real trouble. If you hadn't been there and hadn't\r\nacted with such presence of mind, it would have been terrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, if that fellow was annoying you, you could have called\r\na policeman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it wasn't anything like that. It was much, much worse. But I\r\nmustn't go on like this. It isn't fair on you.\" Her eyes lit up\r\nagain with the old shining smile. \"I know you have no curiosity\r\nabout me, but still there's no knowing whether I might not arouse\r\nsome if I went on piling up the mystery. And the silly part is that\r\nreally there's no mystery at all. It's just that I can't tell\r\nanyone about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That very fact seems to me to constitute the makings of a pretty\r\nfair mystery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what I mean is, I'm not a princess in disguise trying to\r\nescape from anarchists, or anything like those things you read\r\nabout in books. I'm just in a perfectly simple piece of trouble.\r\nYou would be bored to death if I told you about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try me.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"No. Besides, here we are.\" The cab had stopped at the hotel, and a\r\ncommissionaire was already opening the door. \"Now, if you haven't\r\nrepented of your rash offer and really are going to be so awfully\r\nkind as to let me have that money, would you mind rushing off and\r\ngetting it, because I must hurry. I can just catch a good train,\r\nand it's hours to the next.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you wait here? I'll be back in a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\nThe last George saw of her was another of those exhilarating smiles\r\nof hers. It was literally the last he saw of her, for, when he\r\nreturned not more than two minutes later, the cab had gone, the\r\ngirl had gone, and the world was empty.\r\n\r\nTo him, gaping at this wholly unforeseen calamity the commissionaire\r\nvouchsafed information.\r\n\r\n\"The young lady took the cab on, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Took the cab on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost immediately after you had gone, sir, she got in again and\r\ntold the man to drive to Waterloo.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge could make nothing of it. He stood there in silent\r\nperplexity, and might have continued to stand indefinitely, had not\r\nhis mind been distracted by a dictatorial voice at his elbow.\r\n\r\n\"You, sir! Dammit!\"\r\n\r\nA second taxi-cab had pulled up, and from it a stout, scarlet-\r\nfaced young man had sprung. One glance told George all. The hunt\r\nwas up once more. The bloodhound had picked up the trail. Percy was\r\nin again!\r\n\r\nFor the first time since he had become aware of her flight, George\r\nwas thankful that the girl had disappeared. He perceived that he\r\nhad too quickly eliminated Percy from the list of the Things That\r\nMatter. Engrossed with his own affairs, and having regarded their\r\nlate skirmish as a decisive battle from which there would be no\r\nrallying, he had overlooked the possibility of this annoying and\r\nunnecessary person following them in another cab--a task which, in\r\nthe congested, slow-moving traffic, must have been a perfectly\r\nsimple one. Well, here he was, his soul manifestly all stirred up\r\nand his blood-pressure at a far higher figure than his doctor would\r\nhave approved of, and the matter would have to be opened all over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Now then!\" said the stout young man.\r\n\r\nGeorge regarded him with a critical and unfriendly eye. He disliked\r\nthis fatty degeneration excessively. Looking him up and down, he\r\ncould find no point about him that gave him the least pleasure,\r\nwith the single exception of the state of his hat, in the side of\r\nwhich he was rejoiced to perceive there was a large and unshapely\r\ndent.\r\n\r\n\"You thought you had shaken me off! You thought you'd given me the\r\nslip! Well, you're wrong!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge eyed him coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I know what's the matter with you,\" he said. \"Someone's been\r\nfeeding you meat.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man bubbled with fury. His face turned a deeper scarlet.\r\nHe gesticulated.\r\n\r\n\"You blackguard! Where's my sister?\"\r\n\r\nAt this extraordinary remark the world rocked about George dizzily.\r\nThe words upset his entire diagnosis of the situation. Until that\r\nmoment he had looked upon this man as a Lothario, a pursuer of\r\ndamsels. That the other could possibly have any right on his side\r\nhad never occurred to him. He felt unmanned by the shock. It seemed\r\nto cut the ground from under his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Your sister!\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard what I said. Where is she?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was still endeavouring to adjust his scattered faculties.\r\nHe felt foolish and apologetic. He had imagined himself unassailably\r\nin the right, and it now appeared that he was in the wrong.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was about to become conciliatory. Then the\r\nrecollection of the girl's panic and her hints at some trouble\r\nwhich threatened her--presumably through the medium of this man,\r\nbrother or no brother--checked him. He did not know what it was all\r\nabout, but the one thing that did stand out clearly in the welter\r\nof confused happenings was the girl's need for his assistance.\r\nWhatever might be the rights of the case, he was her accomplice,\r\nand must behave as such.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe young man shook a large, gloved fist in his face.\r\n\r\n\"You blackguard!\"\r\n\r\nA rich, deep, soft, soothing voice slid into the heated scene like\r\nthe Holy Grail sliding athwart a sunbeam.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this?\"\r\n\r\nA vast policeman had materialized from nowhere. He stood beside\r\nthem, a living statue of Vigilant Authority. One thumb rested\r\neasily on his broad belt. The fingers of the other hand caressed\r\nlightly a moustache that had caused more heart-burnings among the\r\ngentler sex than any other two moustaches in the C-division. The\r\neyes above the moustache were stern and questioning.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge liked policemen. He knew the way to treat them. His voice,\r\nwhen he replied, had precisely the correct note of respectful\r\ndeference which the Force likes to hear.\r\n\r\n\"I really couldn't say, officer,\" he said, with just that air of\r\nhaving in a time of trouble found a kind elder brother to help him\r\nout of his difficulties which made the constable his ally on the\r\nspot. \"I was standing here, when this man suddenly made his\r\nextraordinary attack on me. I wish you would ask him to go away.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman tapped the stout young man on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"This won't do, you know!\" he said austerely. \"This sort o' thing\r\nwon't do, 'ere, you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take your hands off me!\" snorted Percy.\r\n\r\nA frown appeared on the Olympian brow. Jove reached for his\r\nthunderbolts.\r\n\r\n\"'Ullo! 'Ullo! 'Ullo!\" he said in a shocked voice, as of a god\r\ndefied by a mortal. \"'Ullo! 'Ullo! 'Ul-lo!\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers fell on Percy's shoulder again, but this time not in a\r\nmere warning tap. They rested where they fell--in an iron clutch.\r\n\r\n\"It won't do, you know,\" he said. \"This sort o' thing won't do!\"\r\nMadness came upon the stout young man. Common prudence and the\r\nlessons of a carefully-taught youth fell from him like a garment.\r\nWith an incoherent howl he wriggled round and punched the policeman\r\nsmartly in the stomach.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" quoth the outraged officer, suddenly becoming human. His\r\nleft hand removed itself from the belt, and he got a businesslike\r\ngrip on his adversary's collar. \"Will you come along with me!\"\r\n\r\nIt was amazing. The thing had happened in such an incredibly brief\r\nspace of time. One moment, it seemed to George, he was the centre\r\nof a nasty row in one of the most public spots in London; the next,\r\nthe focus had shifted; he had ceased to matter; and the entire\r\nattention of the metropolis was focused on his late assailant, as,\r\nurged by the arm of the Law, he made that journey to Vine Street\r\nPolice Station which so many a better man than he had trod.\r\n\r\nGeorge watched the pair as they moved up the Haymarket, followed by\r\na growing and increasingly absorbed crowd; then he turned into the\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" he said to himself; \"is the middle of a perfect day! And I\r\nthought London dull!\""
