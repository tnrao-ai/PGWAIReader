    "The first requisite of an invading army is a base. George, having\r\nentered Belpher village and thus accomplished the first stage in his\r\nforeward movement on the castle, selected as his base the Marshmoreton\r\nArms. Selected is perhaps hardly the right word, as it implies choice,\r\nand in George's case there was no choice. There are two inns at Belpher,\r\nbut the Marshmoreton Arms is the only one that offers accommodation for\r\nman and beast, assuming--that is to say--that the man and beast desire\r\nto spend the night. The other house, the Blue Boar, is a mere beerhouse,\r\nwhere the lower strata of Belpher society gather of a night to quench\r\ntheir thirst and to tell one another interminable stories without any\r\npoint whatsoever. But the Marshmoreton Arms is a comfortable,\r\nrespectable hostelry, catering for the village plutocrats. There of an\r\nevening you will find the local veterinary surgeon smoking a pipe with\r\nthe grocer, the baker, and the butcher, with perhaps a sprinkling of\r\nneighbouring farmers to help the conversation along. On Saturdays there\r\nis a \"shilling ordinary\"--which is rural English for a cut off the joint\r\nand a boiled potato, followed by hunks of the sort of cheese which\r\nbelieves that it pays to advertise, and this is usually well attended.\r\nOn the other days of the week, until late in the evening, however, the\r\nvisitor to the Marshmoreton Arms has the place almost entirely to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt is to be questioned whether in the whole length and breadth of\r\nthe world there is a more admirable spot for a man in love to pass\r\na day or two than the typical English village. The Rocky Mountains,\r\nthat traditional stamping-ground for the heartbroken, may be well\r\nenough in their way; but a lover has to be cast in a pretty stern\r\nmould to be able to be introspective when at any moment he may meet\r\nan annoyed cinnamon bear. In the English village there are no such\r\nobstacles to meditation. It combines the comforts of civilization\r\nwith the restfulness of solitude in a manner equalled by no other\r\nspot except the New York Public Library. Here your lover may wander\r\nto and fro unmolested, speaking to nobody, by nobody addressed, and\r\nhave the satisfaction at the end of the day of sitting down to a\r\ncapitally cooked chop and chips, lubricated by golden English ale.\r\n\r\nBelpher, in addition to all the advantages of the usual village,\r\nhas a quiet charm all its own, due to the fact that it has seen\r\nbetter days. In a sense, it is a ruin, and ruins are always\r\nsoothing to the bruised soul. Ten years before, Belpher had been a\r\nflourishing centre of the South of England oyster trade. It is\r\nsituated by the shore, where Hayling Island, lying athwart the\r\nmouth of the bay, forms the waters into a sort of brackish lagoon,\r\nin much the same way as Fire Island shuts off the Great South Bay\r\nof Long Island from the waves of the Atlantic. The water of Belpher\r\nCreek is shallow even at high tide, and when the tide runs out it\r\nleaves glistening mud flats, which it is the peculiar taste of the\r\noyster to prefer to any other habitation. For years Belpher oysters\r\nhad been the mainstay of gay supper parties at the Savoy, the\r\nCarlton and Romano's. Dukes doted on them; chorus girls wept if\r\nthey were not on the bill of fare. And then, in an evil hour,\r\nsomebody discovered that what made the Belpher Oyster so\r\nparticularly plump and succulent was the fact that it breakfasted,\r\nlunched and dined almost entirely on the local sewage. There is but\r\na thin line ever between popular homage and execration. We see it\r\nin the case of politicians, generals and prize-fighters; and\r\noysters are no exception to the rule. There was a typhoid\r\nscare--quite a passing and unjustified scare, but strong enough to\r\ndo its deadly work; and almost overnight Belpher passed from a\r\nplace of flourishing industry to the sleepy, by-the-world-forgotten\r\nspot which it was when George Bevan discovered it. The shallow\r\nwater is still there; the mud is still there; even the oyster-beds\r\nare still there; but not the oysters nor the little world of\r\nactivity which had sprung up around them. The glory of Belpher is\r\ndead; and over its gates Ichabod is written. But, if it has lost in\r\nimportance, it has gained in charm; and George, for one, had no\r\nregrets. To him, in his present state of mental upheaval, Belpher\r\nwas the ideal spot.\r\n\r\nIt was not at first that George roused himself to the point of\r\nasking why he was here and what--now that he was here--he proposed\r\nto do. For two languorous days he loafed, sufficiently occupied\r\nwith his thoughts. He smoked long, peaceful pipes in the\r\nstable-yard, watching the ostlers as they groomed the horses; he\r\nplayed with the Inn puppy, bestowed respectful caresses on the Inn\r\ncat. He walked down the quaint cobbled street to the harbour,\r\nsauntered along the shore, and lay on his back on the little beach\r\nat the other side of the lagoon, from where he could see the red\r\nroofs of the village, while the imitation waves splashed busily on\r\nthe stones, trying to conceal with bustle and energy the fact that\r\nthe water even two hundred yards from the shore was only eighteen\r\ninches deep. For it is the abiding hope of Belpher Creek that it\r\nmay be able to deceive the occasional visitor into mistaking it for\r\nthe open sea.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the tide would ebb. The waste of waters became a sea\r\nof mud, cheerfully covered as to much of its surface with green\r\ngrasses. The evening sun struck rainbow colours from the moist\r\nsoftness. Birds sang in the thickets. And George, heaving himself\r\nup, walked back to the friendly cosiness of the Marshmoreton Arms.\r\nAnd the remarkable part of it was that everything seemed perfectly\r\nnatural and sensible to him, nor had he any particular feeling that\r\nin falling in love with Lady Maud Marsh and pursuing her to Belpher\r\nhe had set himself anything in the nature of a hopeless task. Like\r\none kissed by a goddess in a dream, he walked on air; and, while\r\none is walking on air, it is easy to overlook the boulders in the\r\npath.\r\n\r\nConsider his position, you faint-hearted and self-pitying young men\r\nwho think you have a tough row to hoe just because, when you pay\r\nyour evening visit with the pound box of candy under your arm, you\r\nsee the handsome sophomore from Yale sitting beside her on the\r\nporch, playing the ukulele. If ever the world has turned black to\r\nyou in such a situation and the moon gone in behind a cloud, think\r\nof George Bevan and what he was up against. You are at least on the\r\nspot. You can at least put up a fight. If there are ukuleles in the\r\nworld, there are also guitars, and tomorrow it may be you and not\r\nhe who sits on the moonlit porch; it may be he and not you who\r\narrives late. Who knows? Tomorrow he may not show up till you have\r\nfinished the Bedouin's Love Song and are annoying the local birds,\r\nroosting in the trees, with Poor Butterfly.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean to say is, you are on the map. You have a sporting\r\nchance. Whereas George... Well, just go over to England and try\r\nwooing an earl's daughter whom you have only met once--and then\r\nwithout an introduction; whose brother's hat you have smashed\r\nbeyond repair; whose family wishes her to marry some other man: who\r\nwants to marry some other man herself--and not the same other man,\r\nbut another other man; who is closely immured in a mediaeval castle\r\n. . . Well, all I say is--try it. And then go back to your porch\r\nwith a chastened spirit and admit that you might be a whole lot\r\nworse off.\r\n\r\nGeorge, as I say, had not envisaged the peculiar difficulties of\r\nhis position. Nor did he until the evening of his second day at the\r\nMarshmoreton Arms. Until then, as I have indicated, he roamed in a\r\ngolden mist of dreamy meditation among the soothing by-ways of the\r\nvillage of Belpher. But after lunch on the second day it came upon\r\nhim that all this sort of thing was pleasant but not practical.\r\nAction was what was needed. Action.\r\n\r\nThe first, the obvious move was to locate the castle. Inquiries at\r\nthe Marshmoreton Arms elicited the fact that it was \"a step\" up the\r\nroad that ran past the front door of the inn. But this wasn't the\r\nday of the week when the general public was admitted. The\r\nsightseer could invade Belpher Castle on Thursdays only, between\r\nthe hours of two and four. On other days of the week all he could\r\ndo was to stand like Moses on Pisgah and take in the general effect\r\nfrom a distance. As this was all that George had hoped to be able\r\nto do, he set forth.\r\n\r\nIt speedily became evident to George that \"a step\" was a euphemism.\r\nFive miles did he tramp before, trudging wearily up a winding lane,\r\nhe came out on a breeze-swept hill-top, and saw below him, nestling\r\nin its trees, what was now for him the centre of the world. He sat\r\non a stone wall and lit a pipe. Belpher Castle. Maud's home. There\r\nit was. And now what?\r\n\r\nThe first thought that came to him was practical, even prosaic--\r\nthe thought that he couldn't possibly do this five-miles-there\r\nand-five-miles-back walk, every time he wanted to see the place.\r\nHe must shift his base nearer the scene of operations. One of those\r\ntrim, thatched cottages down there in the valley would be just the\r\nthing, if he could arrange to take possession of it. They sat there\r\nall round the castle, singly and in groups, like small dogs round\r\ntheir master. They looked as if they had been there for centuries.\r\nProbably they had, as they were made of stone as solid as that of\r\nthe castle. There must have been a time, thought George, when the\r\ncastle was the central rallying-point for all those scattered\r\nhomes; when rumour of danger from marauders had sent all that\r\nlittle community scuttling for safety to the sheltering walls.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since he had set out on his expedition, a\r\ncertain chill, a discomforting sinking of the heart, afflicted\r\nGeorge as he gazed down at the grim grey fortress which he had\r\nundertaken to storm. So must have felt those marauders of old when\r\nthey climbed to the top of this very hill to spy out the land. And\r\nGeorge's case was even worse than theirs. They could at least hope\r\nthat a strong arm and a stout heart would carry them past those\r\nsolid walls; they had not to think of social etiquette. Whereas\r\nGeorge was so situated that an unsympathetic butler could put him to\r\nrout by refusing him admittance.\r\n\r\nThe evening was drawing in. Already, in the brief time he had spent\r\non the hill-top, the sky had turned from blue to saffron and from\r\nsaffron to grey. The plaintive voices of homing cows floated up to\r\nhim from the valley below. A bat had left its shelter and was\r\nwheeling around him, a sinister blot against the sky. A sickle moon\r\ngleamed over the trees. George felt cold. He turned. The shadows\r\nof night wrapped him round, and little things in the hedgerows\r\nchirped and chittered mockery at him as he stumbled down the lane.\r\n\r\nGeorge's request for a lonely furnished cottage somewhere in the\r\nneighbourhood of the castle did not, as he had feared, strike the\r\nBelpher house-agent as the demand of a lunatic. Every well-dressed\r\nstranger who comes to Belpher is automatically set down by the\r\nnatives as an artist, for the picturesqueness of the place has\r\ncaused it to be much infested by the brothers and sisters of the\r\nbrush. In asking for a cottage, indeed, George did precisely as\r\nBelpher society expected him to do; and the agent was reaching for\r\nhis list almost before the words were out of his mouth. In less\r\nthan half an hour George was out in the street again, the owner for\r\nthe season of what the agent described as a \"gem\" and the employer\r\nof a farmer's wife who lived near-by and would, as was her custom\r\nwith artists, come in the morning and evening to \"do\" for him. The\r\ninterview would have taken but a few minutes, had it not been\r\nprolonged by the chattiness of the agent on the subject of the\r\noccupants of the castle, to which George listened attentively. He\r\nwas not greatly encouraged by what he heard of Lord Marshmoreton.\r\nThe earl had made himself notably unpopular in the village recently\r\nby his firm--the house-agent said \"pig-headed\"--attitude in respect\r\nto a certain dispute about a right-of-way. It was Lady Caroline,\r\nand not the easy-going peer, who was really to blame in the matter;\r\nbut the impression that George got from the house-agent's\r\ndescription of Lord Marshmoreton was that the latter was a sort of\r\nNero, possessing, in addition to the qualities of a Roman tyrant,\r\nmany of the least lovable traits of the ghila monster of Arizona.\r\nHearing this about her father, and having already had the privilege\r\nof meeting her brother and studying him at first hand, his heart\r\nbled for Maud. It seemed to him that existence at the castle in\r\nsuch society must be little short of torture.\r\n\r\n\"I must do something,\" he muttered. \"I must do something quick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beg pardon,\" said the house-agent.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said George. \"Well, I'll take that cottage. I'd better\r\nwrite you a cheque for the first month's rent now.\"\r\n\r\nSo George took up his abode, full of strenuous--if vague--purpose,\r\nin the plainly-furnished but not uncomfortable cottage known\r\nlocally as \"the one down by Platt's.\" He might have found a worse\r\nbillet. It was a two-storied building of stained red brick, not one\r\nof the thatched nests on which he had looked down from the hill.\r\nThose were not for rent, being occupied by families whose ancestors\r\nhad occupied them for generations back. The one down by Platt's\r\nwas a more modern structure--a speculation, in fact, of the farmer\r\nwhose wife came to \"do\" for George, and designed especially to\r\naccommodate the stranger who had the desire and the money to rent\r\nit. It so departed from type that it possessed a small but\r\nundeniable bath-room. Besides this miracle, there was a cosy\r\nsitting-room, a larger bedroom on the floor above and next to this\r\nan empty room facing north, which had evidently served artist\r\noccupants as a studio. The remainder of the ground floor was taken\r\nup by kitchen and scullery. The furniture had been constructed by\r\nsomebody who would probably have done very well if he had taken up\r\nsome other line of industry; but it was mitigated by a very fine\r\nand comfortable wicker easy chair, left there by one of last year's\r\nartists; and other artists had helped along the good work by\r\nrelieving the plainness of the walls with a landscape or two. In\r\nfact, when George had removed from the room two antimacassars,\r\nthree group photographs of the farmer's relations, an illuminated\r\ntext, and a china statuette of the Infant Samuel, and stacked them\r\nin a corner of the empty studio, the place became almost a home\r\nfrom home.\r\n\r\nSolitude can be very unsolitary if a man is in love. George never\r\neven began to be bored. The only thing that in any way troubled his\r\npeace was the thought that he was not accomplishing a great deal in\r\nthe matter of helping Maud out of whatever trouble it was that had\r\nbefallen her. The most he could do was to prowl about roads near\r\nthe castle in the hope of an accidental meeting. And such was his\r\ngood fortune that, on the fourth day of his vigil, the accidental\r\nmeeting occurred.\r\n\r\nTaking his morning prowl along the lanes, he was rewarded by the\r\nsight of a grey racing-car at the side of the road. It was empty,\r\nbut from underneath it protruded a pair of long legs, while beside\r\nit stood a girl, at the sight of whom George's heart began to thump\r\nso violently that the long-legged one might have been pardoned had\r\nhe supposed that his engine had started again of its own volition.\r\n\r\nUntil he spoke the soft grass had kept her from hearing his\r\napproach. He stopped close behind her, and cleared his throat. She\r\nstarted and turned, and their eyes met.\r\n\r\nFor a moment hers were empty of any recognition. Then they lit up.\r\nShe caught her breath quickly, and a faint flush came into her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Can I help you?\" asked George.\r\n\r\nThe long legs wriggled out into the road followed by a long body.\r\nThe young man under the car sat up, turning a grease-streaked and\r\npleasant face to George.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I help you? I know how to fix a car.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man beamed in friendly fashion.\r\n\r\n\"It's awfully good of you, old chap, but so do I. It's the only\r\nthing I can do well. Thanks very much and so forth all the same.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge fastened his eyes on the girl's. She had not spoken.\r\n\r\n\"If there is anything in the world I can possibly do for you,\" he\r\nsaid slowly, \"I hope you will let me know. I should like above all\r\nthings to help you.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said in a low voice almost inaudible.\r\n\r\nGeorge walked away. The grease-streaked young man followed him with\r\nhis gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Civil cove, that,\" he said. \"Rather gushing though, what?\r\nAmerican, wasn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I think he was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Americans are the civillest coves I ever struck. I remember asking\r\nthe way of a chappie at Baltimore a couple of years ago when I was\r\nthere in my yacht, and he followed me for miles, shrieking advice\r\nand encouragement. I thought it deuced civil of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would hurry up and get the car right, Reggie. We shall\r\nbe awfully late for lunch.\"\r\n\r\nReggie Byng began to slide backwards under the car.\r\n\r\n\"All right, dear heart. Rely on me. It's something quite simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do be quick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imitation of greased lightning--very difficult,\" said Reggie\r\nencouragingly. \"Be patient. Try and amuse yourself somehow. Ask\r\nyourself a riddle. Tell yourself a few anecdotes. I'll be with you\r\nin a moment. I say, I wonder what the cove is doing at Belpher?\r\nDeuced civil cove,\" said Reggie approvingly. \"I liked him. And now,\r\nbusiness of repairing breakdown.\"\r\n\r\nHis smiling face vanished under the car like the Cheshire cat.\r\nMaud stood looking thoughtfully down the road in the direction in\r\nwhich George had disappeared."
