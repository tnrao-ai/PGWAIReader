    "The following day was a Thursday and on Thursdays, as has been\r\nstated, Belpher Castle was thrown open to the general public between\r\nthe hours of two and four. It was a tradition of long standing, this\r\nperiodical lowering of the barriers, and had always been faithfully\r\nobserved by Lord Marshmoreton ever since his accession to the title.\r\nBy the permanent occupants of the castle the day was regarded with\r\nmixed feelings. Lord Belpher, while approving of it in theory, as he\r\ndid of all the family traditions--for he was a great supporter of\r\nall things feudal, and took his position as one of the hereditary\r\naristocracy of Great Britain extremely seriously--heartily disliked\r\nit in practice. More than once he had been obliged to exit hastily\r\nby a further door in order to keep from being discovered by a drove\r\nof tourists intent on inspecting the library or the great\r\ndrawing-room; and now it was his custom to retire to his bedroom\r\nimmediately after lunch and not to emerge until the tide of invasion\r\nhad ebbed away.\r\n\r\nKeggs, the butler, always looked forward to Thursdays with\r\npleasurable anticipation. He enjoyed the sense of authority which\r\nit gave him to herd these poor outcasts to and fro among the\r\nsurroundings which were an everyday commonplace to himself. Also\r\nhe liked hearing the sound of his own voice as it lectured in\r\nrolling periods on the objects of interest by the way-side. But\r\neven to Keggs there was a bitter mixed with the sweet. No one was\r\nbetter aware than himself that the nobility of his manner,\r\nexcellent as a means of impressing the mob, worked against him when\r\nit came to a question of tips. Again and again had he been harrowed\r\nby the spectacle of tourists, huddled together like sheep, debating\r\namong themselves in nervous whispers as to whether they could offer\r\nthis personage anything so contemptible as half a crown for himself\r\nand deciding that such an insult was out of the question. It was\r\nhis endeavour, especially towards the end of the proceedings, to\r\ncultivate a manner blending a dignity fitting his position with a\r\nsunny geniality which would allay the timid doubts of the tourist\r\nand indicate to him that, bizarre as the idea might seem, there was\r\nnothing to prevent him placing his poor silver in more worthy\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nPossibly the only member of the castle community who was absolutely\r\nindifferent to these public visits was Lord Marshmoreton. He made\r\nno difference between Thursday and any other day. Precisely as\r\nusual he donned his stained corduroys and pottered about his\r\nbeloved garden; and when, as happened on an average once a quarter,\r\nsome visitor, strayed from the main herd, came upon him as he\r\nworked and mistook him for one of the gardeners, he accepted the\r\nerror without any attempt at explanation, sometimes going so far as\r\nto encourage it by adopting a rustic accent in keeping with his\r\nappearance. This sort of thing tickled the simple-minded peer.\r\n\r\nGeorge joined the procession punctually at two o'clock, just as\r\nKeggs was clearing his throat preparatory to saying, \"We are now in\r\nthe main 'all, and before going any further I would like to call\r\nyour attention to Sir Peter Lely's portrait of--\" It was his custom\r\nto begin his Thursday lectures with this remark, but today it was\r\npostponed; for, no sooner had George appeared, than a breezy voice\r\non the outskirts of the throng spoke in a tone that made\r\ncompetition impossible.\r\n\r\n\"For goodness' sake, George.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Billie Dore detached herself from the group, a trim vision in\r\nblue. She wore a dust-coat and a motor veil, and her eyes and\r\ncheeks were glowing from the fresh air.\r\n\r\n\"For goodness' sake, George, what are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just going to ask you the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I motored down with a boy I know. We had a breakdown just\r\noutside the gates. We were on our way to Brighton for lunch. He\r\nsuggested I should pass the time seeing the sights while he fixed\r\nup the sprockets or the differential gear or whatever it was. He's\r\ncoming to pick me up when he's through. But, on the level, George,\r\nhow do you get this way? You sneak out of town and leave the show\r\nflat, and nobody has a notion where you are. Why, we were thinking\r\nof advertising for you, or going to the police or something. For\r\nall anybody knew, you might have been sandbagged or dropped in the\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the matter had not occurred to George till now. His\r\nsudden descent on Belpher had seemed to him the only natural course\r\nto pursue. He had not realized that he would be missed, and that\r\nhis absence might have caused grave inconvenience to a large number\r\nof people.\r\n\r\n\"I never thought of that. I--well, I just happened to come here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You aren't living in this old castle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite. I've a cottage down the road. I wanted a few days in\r\nthe country so I rented it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what made you choose this place?\"\r\n\r\nKeggs, who had been regarding these disturbers of the peace with\r\ndignified disapproval, coughed.\r\n\r\n\"If you would not mind, madam. We are waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? How's that?\" Miss Dore looked up with a bright smile. \"I'm\r\nsorry. Come along, George. Get in the game.\" She nodded cheerfully\r\nto the butler. \"All right. All set now. You may fire when ready,\r\nGridley.\"\r\n\r\nKeggs bowed austerely, and cleared his throat again.\r\n\r\n\"We are now in the main 'all, and before going any further I would\r\nlike to call your attention to Sir Peter Lely's portrait of the\r\nfifth countess. Said by experts to be in his best manner.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an almost soundless murmur from the mob, expressive of\r\nwonder and awe, like a gentle breeze rustling leaves. Billie Dore\r\nresumed her conversation in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there was an awful lot of excitement when they found that you\r\nhad disappeared. They were phoning the Carlton every ten minutes\r\ntrying to get you. You see, the summertime number flopped on the\r\nsecond night, and they hadn't anything to put in its place. But\r\nit's all right. They took it out and sewed up the wound, and now\r\nyou'd never know there had been anything wrong. The show was ten\r\nminutes too long, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's the show going?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a riot. They think it will run two years in London. As far\r\nas I can make it out you don't call it a success in London unless\r\nyou can take your grandchildren to see the thousandth night.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's splendid. And how is everybody? All right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. That fellow Gray is still hanging round Babe. It beats me\r\nwhat she sees in him. Anybody but an infant could see the man\r\nwasn't on the level. Well, I don't blame you for quitting London,\r\nGeorge. This sort of thing is worth fifty Londons.\"\r\n\r\nThe procession had reached one of the upper rooms, and they were\r\nlooking down from a window that commanded a sweep of miles of the\r\ncountryside, rolling and green and wooded. Far away beyond the last\r\ncovert Belpher Bay gleamed like a streak of silver. Billie Dore\r\ngave a little sigh.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing like this in the world. I'd like to stand here for\r\nthe rest of my life, just lapping it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will call your attention,\" boomed Keggs at their elbow, \"to this\r\nwindow, known in the fem'ly tredition as Leonard's Leap. It was in\r\nthe year seventeen 'undred and eighty-seven that Lord Leonard\r\nForth, eldest son of 'Is Grace the Dook of Lochlane, 'urled 'imself\r\nout of this window in order to avoid compromising the beautiful\r\nCountess of Marshmoreton, with oom 'e is related to 'ave 'ad a\r\nninnocent romance. Surprised at an advanced hour by 'is lordship\r\nthe earl in 'er ladyship's boudoir, as this room then was, 'e\r\nleaped through the open window into the boughs of the cedar tree\r\nwhich stands below, and was fortunate enough to escape with a few\r\n'armless contusions.\"\r\n\r\nA murmur of admiration greeted the recital of the ready tact of\r\nthis eighteenth-century Steve Brodie.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Billie enthusiastically, \"that's exactly what I mean\r\nabout this country. It's just a mass of Leonard's Leaps and things.\r\nI'd like to settle down in this sort of place and spend the rest of\r\nmy life milking cows and taking forkfuls of soup to the deserving\r\nvillagers.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will now,\" said Keggs, herding the mob with a gesture, \"proceed\r\nto the Amber Drawing-Room, containing some Gobelin Tapestries\r\n'ighly spoken of by connoozers.\"\r\n\r\nThe obedient mob began to drift out in his wake.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, George,\" asked Billie in an undertone, \"if we\r\nside-step the Amber Drawing-Room? I'm wild to get into that garden.\r\nThere's a man working among those roses. Maybe he would show us\r\nround.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge followed her pointing finger. Just below them a sturdy,\r\nbrown-faced man in corduroys was pausing to light a stubby pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Just as you like.\"\r\n\r\nThey made their way down the great staircase. The voice of Keggs,\r\nsaying complimentary things about the Gobelin Tapestry, came to\r\ntheir ears like the roll of distant drums. They wandered out\r\ntowards the rose-garden. The man in corduroys had lit his pipe and\r\nwas bending once more to his task.\r\n\r\n\"Well, dadda,\" said Billie amiably, \"how are the crops?\"\r\n\r\nThe man straightened himself. He was a nice-looking man of middle\r\nage, with the kind eyes of a friendly dog. He smiled genially, and\r\nstarted to put his pipe away.\r\n\r\nBillie stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't stop smoking on my account,\" she said. \"I like it. Well,\r\nyou've got the right sort of a job, haven't you! If I was a man,\r\nthere's nothing I'd like better than to put in my eight hours in a\r\nrose-garden.\" She looked about her. \"And this,\" she said with\r\napproval, \"is just what a rose-garden ought to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you fond of roses--missy?\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet I am! You must have every kind here that was ever\r\ninvented. All the fifty-seven varieties.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are nearly three thousand varieties,\" said the man in\r\ncorduroys tolerantly.\r\n\r\n\"I was speaking colloquially, dadda. You can't teach me anything\r\nabout roses. I'm the guy that invented them. Got any Ayrshires?\"\r\n\r\nThe man in corduroys seemed to have come to the conclusion that\r\nBillie was the only thing on earth that mattered. This revelation\r\nof a kindred spirit had captured him completely. George was merely\r\namong those present.\r\n\r\n\"Those--them--over there are Ayrshires, missy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't get Ayrshires in America. At least, I never ran across\r\nthem. I suppose they do have them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want the right soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clay and lots of rain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an earnest expression on Billie Dore's face that George\r\nhad never seen there before.\r\n\r\n\"Say, listen, dadda, in this matter of rose-beetles, what would you\r\ndo if--\"\r\n\r\nGeorge moved away. The conversation was becoming too technical for\r\nhim, and he had an idea that he would not be missed. There had come\r\nto him, moreover, in a flash one of those sudden inspirations which\r\ngreat generals get. He had visited the castle this afternoon\r\nwithout any settled plan other than a vague hope that he might\r\nsomehow see Maud. He now perceived that there was no chance of\r\ndoing this. Evidently, on Thursdays, the family went to earth and\r\nremained hidden until the sightseers had gone. But there was\r\nanother avenue of communication open to him. This gardener seemed\r\nan exceptionally intelligent man. He could be trusted to deliver a\r\nnote to Maud.\r\n\r\nIn his late rambles about Belpher Castle in the company of Keggs\r\nand his followers, George had been privileged to inspect the\r\nlibrary. It was an easily accessible room, opening off the main\r\nhall. He left Billie and her new friend deep in a discussion of\r\nslugs and plant-lice, and walked quickly back to the house. The\r\nlibrary was unoccupied.\r\n\r\nGeorge was a thorough young man. He believed in leaving nothing to\r\nchance. The gardener had seemed a trustworthy soul, but you never\r\nknew. It was possible that he drank. He might forget or lose the\r\nprecious note. So, with a wary eye on the door, George hastily\r\nscribbled it in duplicate. This took him but a few minutes. He went\r\nout into the garden again to find Billie Dore on the point of\r\nstepping into a blue automobile.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there you are, George. I wondered where you had got to. Say, I\r\nmade quite a hit with dadda. I've given him my address, and he's\r\npromised to send me a whole lot of roses. By the way, shake hands\r\nwith Mr. Forsyth. This is George Bevan, Freddie, who wrote the\r\nmusic of our show.\"\r\n\r\nThe solemn youth at the wheel extended a hand.\r\n\r\n\"Topping show. Topping music. Topping all round.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-bye, George. See you soon, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Give my love to everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Let her rip, Freddie. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThe blue car gathered speed and vanished down the drive. George\r\nreturned to the man in corduroys, who had bent himself double in\r\npursuit of a slug.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute,\" said George hurriedly. He pulled out the first of\r\nthe notes. \"Give this to Lady Maud the first chance you get. It's\r\nimportant. Here's a sovereign for your trouble.\"\r\n\r\nHe hastened away. He noticed that gratification had turned the\r\nother nearly purple in the face, and was anxious to leave him. He\r\nwas a modest young man, and effusive thanks always embarrassed him.\r\n\r\nThere now remained the disposal of the duplicate note. It was\r\nhardly worth while, perhaps, taking such a precaution, but George\r\nknew that victories are won by those who take no chances. He had\r\nwandered perhaps a hundred yards from the rose-garden when he\r\nencountered a small boy in the many-buttoned uniform of a page. The\r\nboy had appeared from behind a big cedar, where, as a matter of\r\nfact, he had been smoking a stolen cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to earn half a crown?\" asked George.\r\n\r\nThe market value of messengers had slumped.\r\n\r\nThe stripling held his hand out.\r\n\r\n\"Give this note to Lady Maud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!\"\r\n\r\n\"See that it reaches her at once.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge walked off with the consciousness of a good day's work done.\r\nAlbert the page, having bitten his half-crown, placed it in his\r\npocket. Then he hurried away, a look of excitement and gratification\r\nin his deep blue eyes."
