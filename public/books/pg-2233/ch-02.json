    "The sun that had shone so brightly on Belpher Castle at noon, when\r\nMaud and Reggie Byng set out on their journey, shone on the\r\nWest-End of London with equal pleasantness at two o'clock. In\r\nLittle Gooch Street all the children of all the small shopkeepers\r\nwho support life in that backwater by selling each other vegetables\r\nand singing canaries were out and about playing curious games of\r\ntheir own invention. Cats washed themselves on doorsteps,\r\npreparatory to looking in for lunch at one of the numerous garbage\r\ncans which dotted the sidewalk. Waiters peered austerely from the\r\nwindows of the two Italian restaurants which carry on the Lucretia\r\nBorgia tradition by means of one shilling and sixpenny _table d'h√¥te_\r\nluncheons. The proprietor of the grocery store on the corner was\r\nbidding a silent farewell to a tomato which even he, though a\r\ndauntless optimist, had been compelled to recognize as having\r\noutlived its utility. On all these things the sun shone with a\r\ngenial smile. Round the corner, in Shaftesbury Avenue, an east wind\r\nwas doing its best to pierce the hardened hides of the citizenry;\r\nbut it did not penetrate into Little Gooch Street, which, facing\r\nsouth and being narrow and sheltered, was enabled practically to\r\nbask.\r\n\r\nMac, the stout guardian of the stage door of the Regal Theatre,\r\nwhose gilded front entrance is on the Avenue, emerged from the\r\nlittle glass case in which the management kept him, and came out to\r\nobserve life and its phenomena with an indulgent eye. Mac was\r\nfeeling happy this morning. His job was a permanent one, not\r\ninfluenced by the success or failure of the productions which\r\nfollowed one another at the theatre throughout the year; but he\r\nfelt, nevertheless, a sort of proprietary interest in these\r\nventures, and was pleased when they secured the approval of the\r\npublic. Last night's opening, a musical piece by an American\r\nauthor and composer, had undoubtedly made a big hit, and Mac was\r\nglad, because he liked what he had seen of the company, and, in the\r\nbrief time in which he had known him, had come to entertain a warm\r\nregard for George Bevan, the composer, who had travelled over from\r\nNew York to help with the London production.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bevan turned the corner now, walking slowly, and, it seemed\r\nto Mac, gloomily towards the stage door. He was a young man of\r\nabout twenty-seven, tall and well knit, with an agreeable,\r\nclean-cut face, of which a pair of good and honest eyes were the\r\nmost noticeable feature. His sensitive mouth was drawn down a\r\nlittle at the corners, and he looked tired.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, Mac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Some telegrams. I'll get 'em. Oh, I'll _get_ 'em,\" said\r\nMac, as if reassuring some doubting friend and supporter as to his\r\nability to carry through a labour of Hercules.\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into his glass case. George Bevan remained outside\r\nin the street surveying the frisking children with a sombre glance.\r\nThey seemed to him very noisy, very dirty and very young.\r\nDisgustingly young. Theirs was joyous, exuberant youth which made a\r\nfellow feel at least sixty. Something was wrong with George today,\r\nfor normally he was fond of children. Indeed, normally he was fond\r\nof most things. He was a good-natured and cheerful young man, who\r\nliked life and the great majority of those who lived it\r\ncontemporaneously with himself. He had no enemies and many\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBut today he had noticed from the moment he had got out of bed that\r\nsomething was amiss with the world. Either he was in the grip of\r\nsome divine discontent due to the highly developed condition of his\r\nsoul, or else he had a grouch. One of the two. Or it might have\r\nbeen the reaction from the emotions of the previous night. On the\r\nmorning after an opening your sensitive artist is always apt to\r\nfeel as if he had been dried over a barrel.\r\n\r\nBesides, last night there had been a supper party after the\r\nperformance at the flat which the comedian of the troupe had rented\r\nin Jermyn Street, a forced, rowdy supper party where a number of\r\ntired people with over-strained nerves had seemed to feel it a duty\r\nto be artificially vivacious. It had lasted till four o'clock when\r\nthe morning papers with the notices arrived, and George had not got\r\nto bed till four-thirty. These things colour the mental outlook.\r\n\r\nMac reappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge put the telegrams in his pocket. A cat, on its way back from\r\nlunch, paused beside him in order to use his leg as a serviette.\r\nGeorge tickled it under the ear abstractedly. He was always\r\ncourteous to cats, but today he went through the movements\r\nperfunctorily and without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe cat moved on. Mac became conversational.\r\n\r\n\"They tell me the piece was a hit last night, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to go very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Missus saw it from the gallery, and all the first-nighters was\r\nspeaking very 'ighly of it. There's a regular click, you know, sir,\r\nover here in London, that goes to all the first nights in the\r\ngallery. 'Ighly critical they are always. Specially if it's an\r\nAmerican piece like this one. If they don't like it, they precious\r\nsoon let you know. My missus ses they was all speakin' very 'ighly\r\nof it. My missus says she ain't seen a livelier show for a long\r\ntime, and she's a great theatregoer. My missus says they was all\r\nspecially pleased with the music.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Morning Leader give it a fine write-up. How was the rest of\r\nthe papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid, all of them. I haven't seen the evening papers yet. I\r\ncame out to get them.\"\r\n\r\nMac looked down the street.\r\n\r\n\"There'll be a rehearsal this afternoon, I suppose, sir? Here's\r\nMiss Dore coming along.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge followed his glance. A tall girl in a tailor-made suit of\r\nblue was coming towards them. Even at a distance one caught the\r\ngenial personality of the new arrival. It seemed to go before her\r\nlike a heartening breeze. She picked her way carefully through the\r\nchildren crawling on the side walk. She stopped for a moment and\r\nsaid something to one of them. The child grinned. Even the\r\nproprietor of the grocery store appeared to brighten up at the\r\nsight of her, as at the sight of some old friend.\r\n\r\n\"How's business, Bill?\" she called to him as she passed the spot\r\nwhere he stood brooding on the mortality of tomatoes. And, though\r\nhe replied \"Rotten\", a faint, grim smile did nevertheless flicker\r\nacross his tragic mask.\r\n\r\nBillie Dore, who was one of the chorus of George Bevan's musical\r\ncomedy, had an attractive face, a mouth that laughed readily,\r\nrather bright golden hair (which, she was fond of insisting with\r\nperfect truth, was genuine though appearances were against it), and\r\nsteady blue eyes. The latter were frequently employed by her in\r\nquelling admirers who were encouraged by the former to become too\r\nardent. Billie's views on the opposite sex who forgot themselves\r\nwere as rigid as those of Lord Marshmoreton concerning thrips. She\r\nliked men, and she would signify this liking in a practical manner\r\nby lunching and dining with them, but she was entirely\r\nself-supporting, and when men overlooked that fact she reminded\r\nthem of it in no uncertain voice; for she was a girl of ready speech\r\nand direct.\r\n\r\n\"'Morning, George. 'Morning, Mac. Any mail?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did your better four-fifths like the show, Mac?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just telling Mr. Bevan, miss, that the missus said she\r\n'adn't seen a livelier show for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. I knew I'd be a hit. Well, George, how's the boy this bright\r\nafternoon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Limp and pessimistic.\"\r\n\r\n\"That comes of sitting up till four in the morning with festive\r\nhams.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were up as late as I was, and you look like Little Eva after a\r\nnight of sweet, childish slumber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I drank ginger ale, and didn't smoke eighteen cigars. And\r\nyet, I don't know. I think I must be getting old, George. All-night\r\nparties seem to have lost their charm. I was ready to quit at one\r\no'clock, but it didn't seem matey. I think I'll marry a farmer and\r\nsettle down.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was amazed. He had not expected to find his present view of\r\nlife shared in this quarter.\r\n\r\n\"I was just thinking myself,\" he said, feeling not for the first\r\ntime how different Billie was from the majority of those with whom\r\nhis profession brought him in contact, \"how flat it all was. The\r\nshow business I mean, and these darned first nights, and the party\r\nafter the show which you can't sidestep. Something tells me I'm\r\nabout through.\"\r\n\r\nBillie Dore nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Anybody with any sense is always about through with the show\r\nbusiness. I know I am. If you think I'm wedded to my art, let me\r\ntell you I'm going to get a divorce the first chance that comes\r\nalong. It's funny about the show business. The way one drifts into\r\nit and sticks, I mean. Take me, for example. Nature had it all\r\ndoped out for me to be the Belle of Hicks Corners. What I ought to\r\nhave done was to buy a gingham bonnet and milk cows. But I would\r\ncome to the great city and help brighten up the tired business\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know you were fond of the country, Billie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? I wrote the words and music. Didn't you know I was a country\r\nkid? My dad ran a Bide a Wee Home for flowers, and I used to know\r\nthem all by their middle names. He was a nursery gardener out in\r\nIndiana. I tell you, when I see a rose nowadays, I shake its hand\r\nand say: 'Well, well, Cyril, how's everything with you? And how are\r\nJoe and Jack and Jimmy and all the rest of the boys at home?' Do\r\nyou know how I used to put in my time the first few nights I was\r\nover here in London? I used to hang around Covent Garden with my\r\nhead back, sniffing. The boys that mess about with the flowers\r\nthere used to stub their toes on me so often that they got to look\r\non me as part of the scenery.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's where we ought to have been last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd have had a better time. Say, George, did you see the awful\r\nmistake on Nature's part that Babe Sinclair showed up with towards\r\nthe middle of the proceedings? You must have noticed him, because\r\nhe took up more room than any one man was entitled to. His name was\r\nSpenser Gray.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge recalled having been introduced to a fat man of his own age\r\nwho answered to that name.\r\n\r\n\"It's a darned shame,\" said Billie indignantly. \"Babe is only a\r\nkid. This is the first show she's been in. And I happen to know\r\nthere's an awfully nice boy over in New York crazy to marry her.\r\nAnd I'm certain this gink is giving her a raw deal. He tried to\r\nget hold of me about a week ago, but I turned him down hard; and I\r\nsuppose he thinks Babe is easier. And it's no good talking to her;\r\nshe thinks he's wonderful. That's another kick I have against the\r\nshow business. It seems to make girls such darned chumps. Well, I\r\nwonder how much longer Mr. Arbuckle is going to be retrieving my\r\nmail. What ho, within there, Fatty!\"\r\n\r\nMac came out, apologetic, carrying letters.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, miss. By an oversight I put you among the G's.\"\r\n\r\n\"All's well that ends well. 'Put me among the G's.' There's a good\r\ntitle for a song for you, George. Excuse me while I grapple with\r\nthe correspondence. I'll bet half of these are mash notes. I got\r\nthree between the first and second acts last night. Why the\r\nnobility and gentry of this burg should think that I'm their\r\naffinity just because I've got golden hair--which is perfectly\r\ngenuine, Mac; I can show you the pedigree--and because I earn an\r\nhonest living singing off the key, is more than I can understand.\"\r\n\r\nMac leaned his massive shoulders comfortably against the building,\r\nand resumed his chat.\r\n\r\n\"I expect you're feeling very 'appy today, sir?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge pondered. He was certainly feeling better since he had seen\r\nBillie Dore, but he was far from being himself.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to be, I suppose. But I'm not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you're getting blarzy, sir, that's what it is. You've 'ad too\r\nmuch of the fat, you 'ave. This piece was a big 'it in America,\r\nwasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It ran over a year in New York, and there are three companies\r\nof it out now.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's 'ow it is, you see. You've gone and got blarzy. Too big a\r\n'elping of success, you've 'ad.\" Mac wagged a head like a harvest\r\nmoon. \"You aren't a married man, are you, sir?\"\r\n\r\nBillie Dore finished skimming through her mail, and crumpled the\r\nletters up into a large ball, which she handed to Mac.\r\n\r\n\"Here's something for you to read in your spare moments, Mac.\r\nGlance through them any time you have a suspicion you may be a\r\nchump, and you'll have the comfort of knowing that there are\r\nothers. What were you saying about being married?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bevan and I was 'aving a talk about 'im being blarzy, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you blarzy, George?\"\r\n\r\n\"So Mac says.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why is he blarzy, miss?\" demanded Mac rhetorically.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Billie. \"It's not my fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's because, as I was saying, 'e's 'ad too big a 'elping of\r\nsuccess, and because 'e ain't a married man. You did say you wasn't\r\na married man, didn't you, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't. But I'm not.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's 'ow it is, you see. You pretty soon gets sick of pulling\r\noff good things, if you ain't got nobody to pat you on the back for\r\ndoing of it. Why, when I was single, if I got 'old of a sure thing\r\nfor the three o'clock race and picked up a couple of quid, the\r\nthrill of it didn't seem to linger somehow. But now, if some of the\r\ngentlemen that come 'ere put me on to something safe and I make a\r\nbit, 'arf the fascination of it is taking the stuff 'ome and\r\nrolling it on to the kitchen table and 'aving 'er pat me on the\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about when you lose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't tell 'er,\" said Mac simply.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to understand the art of being happy, Mac.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ain't an art, sir. It's just gettin' 'old of the right little\r\nwoman, and 'aving a nice little 'ome of your own to go back to at\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mac,\" said Billie admiringly, \"you talk like a Tin Pan Alley song\r\nhit, except that you've left out the scent of honeysuckle and Old\r\nMister Moon climbing up over the trees. Well, you're quite right.\r\nI'm all for the simple and domestic myself. If I could find the\r\nright man, and he didn't see me coming and duck, I'd become one of\r\nthe Mendelssohn's March Daughters right away. Are you going,\r\nGeorge? There's a rehearsal at two-thirty for cuts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to get the evening papers and send off a cable or two. See\r\nyou later.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall meet at Philippi.\"\r\n\r\nMac eyed George's retreating back till he had turned the corner.\r\n\r\n\"A nice pleasant gentleman, Mr. Bevan,\" he said. \"Too bad 'e's got\r\nthe pip the way 'e 'as, just after 'avin' a big success like this\r\n'ere. Comes of bein' a artist, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Dore dived into her vanity case and produced a puff with which\r\nshe proceeded to powder her nose.\r\n\r\n\"All composers are nuts, Mac. I was in a show once where the\r\nmanager was panning the composer because there wasn't a number in\r\nthe score that had a tune to it. The poor geek admitted they\r\nweren't very tuney, but said the thing about his music was that it\r\nhad such a wonderful aroma. They all get that way. The jazz seems\r\nto go to their heads. George is all right, though, and don't let\r\nanyone tell you different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you know him long, miss?\"\r\n\r\n\"About five years. I was a stenographer in the house that published\r\nhis songs when I first met him. And there's another thing you've\r\ngot to hand it to George for. He hasn't let success give him a\r\nswelled head. The money that boy makes is sinful, Mac. He wears\r\nthousand dollar bills next to his skin winter and summer. But he's\r\njust the same as he was when I first knew him, when he was just\r\nhanging around Broadway, looking out for a chance to be allowed to\r\nslip a couple of interpolated numbers into any old show that came\r\nalong. Yes. Put it in your diary, Mac, and write it on your cuff,\r\nGeorge Bevan's all right. He's an ace.\"\r\n\r\nUnconscious of these eulogies, which, coming from one whose\r\njudgment he respected, might have cheered him up, George wandered\r\ndown Shaftesbury Avenue feeling more depressed than ever. The sun\r\nhad gone in for the time being, and the east wind was frolicking\r\nround him like a playful puppy, patting him with a cold paw,\r\nnuzzling his ankles, bounding away and bounding back again, and\r\nbehaving generally as east winds do when they discover a victim who\r\nhas come out without his spring overcoat. It was plain to George\r\nnow that the sun and the wind were a couple of confidence\r\ntricksters working together as a team. The sun had disarmed him\r\nwith specious promises and an air of cheery goodfellowship, and had\r\ndelivered him into the hands of the wind, which was now going\r\nthrough him with the swift thoroughness of the professional hold-up\r\nartist. He quickened his steps, and began to wonder if he was so\r\nsunk in senile decay as to have acquired a liver.\r\n\r\nHe discarded the theory as repellent. And yet there must be a\r\nreason for his depression. Today of all days, as Mac had pointed\r\nout, he had everything to make him happy. Popular as he was in\r\nAmerica, this was the first piece of his to be produced in London,\r\nand there was no doubt that it was a success of unusual dimensions.\r\nAnd yet he felt no elation.\r\n\r\nHe reached Piccadilly and turned westwards. And then, as he passed\r\nthe gates of the In and Out Club, he had a moment of clear vision\r\nand understood everything. He was depressed because he was bored,\r\nand he was bored because he was lonely. Mac, that solid thinker,\r\nhad been right. The solution of the problem of life was to get hold\r\nof the right girl and have a home to go back to at night. He was\r\nmildly surprised that he had tried in any other direction for an\r\nexplanation of his gloom. It was all the more inexplicable in that\r\nfully 80 per cent of the lyrics which he had set in the course of\r\nhis musical comedy career had had that thought at the back of them.\r\n\r\nGeorge gave himself up to an orgy of sentimentality. He seemed to\r\nbe alone in the world which had paired itself off into a sort of\r\nseething welter of happy couples. Taxicabs full of happy couples\r\nrolled by every minute. Passing omnibuses creaked beneath the\r\nweight of happy couples. The very policeman across the Street had\r\njust grinned at a flitting shop girl, and she had smiled back at\r\nhim. The only female in London who did not appear to be attached\r\nwas a girl in brown who was coming along the sidewalk at a\r\nleisurely pace, looking about her in a manner that suggested that\r\nshe found Piccadilly a new and stimulating spectacle.\r\n\r\nAs far as George could see she was an extremely pretty girl, small\r\nand dainty, with a proud little tilt to her head and the jaunty\r\nwalk that spoke of perfect health. She was, in fact, precisely the\r\nsort of girl that George felt he could love with all the stored-up\r\ndevotion of an old buffer of twenty-seven who had squandered none\r\nof his rich nature in foolish flirtations. He had just begun to\r\nweave a rose-tinted romance about their two selves, when a cold\r\nreaction set in. Even as he paused to watch the girl threading her\r\nway through the crowd, the east wind jabbed an icy finger down the\r\nback of his neck, and the chill of it sobered him. After all, he\r\nreflected bitterly, this girl was only alone because she was on her\r\nway somewhere to meet some confounded man. Besides there was no\r\nearthly chance of getting to know her. You can't rush up to pretty\r\ngirls in the street and tell them you are lonely. At least, you\r\ncan, but it doesn't get you anywhere except the police station.\r\nGeorge's gloom deepened--a thing he would not have believed\r\npossible a moment before. He felt that he had been born too late.\r\nThe restraints of modern civilization irked him. It was not, he\r\ntold himself, like this in the good old days.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, for example, this girl would have been a\r\nDamsel; and in that happy time practically everybody whose\r\ntechnical rating was that of Damsel was in distress and only too\r\nwilling to waive the formalities in return for services rendered by\r\nthe casual passer-by. But the twentieth century is a prosaic age,\r\nwhen girls are merely girls and have no troubles at all. Were he\r\nto stop this girl in brown and assure her that his aid and comfort\r\nwere at her disposal, she would undoubtedly call that large\r\npoliceman from across the way, and the romance would begin and end\r\nwithin the space of thirty seconds, or, if the policeman were a\r\nquick mover, rather less.\r\n\r\nBetter to dismiss dreams and return to the practical side of life\r\nby buying the evening papers from the shabby individual beside him,\r\nwho had just thrust an early edition in his face. After all notices\r\nare notices, even when the heart is aching. George felt in his\r\npocket for the necessary money, found emptiness, and remembered\r\nthat he had left all his ready funds at his hotel. It was just one\r\nof the things he might have expected on a day like this.\r\n\r\nThe man with the papers had the air of one whose business is\r\nconducted on purely cash principles. There was only one thing to be\r\ndone, return to the hotel, retrieve his money, and try to forget\r\nthe weight of the world and its cares in lunch. And from the hotel\r\nhe could despatch the two or three cables which he wanted to send\r\nto New York.\r\n\r\nThe girl in brown was quite close now, and George was enabled to\r\nget a clearer glimpse of her. She more than fulfilled the promise\r\nshe had given at a distance. Had she been constructed to his own\r\nspecifications, she would not have been more acceptable in George's\r\nsight. And now she was going out of his life for ever. With an\r\noverwhelming sense of pathos, for there is no pathos more bitter\r\nthan that of parting from someone we have never met, George hailed\r\na taxicab which crawled at the side of the road; and, with all the\r\nrefrains of all the sentimental song hits he had ever composed\r\nringing in his ears, he got in and passed away.\r\n\r\n\"A rotten world,\" he mused, as the cab, after proceeding a couple\r\nof yards, came to a standstill in a block of the traffic. \"A dull,\r\nflat bore of a world, in which nothing happens or ever will happen.\r\nEven when you take a cab it just sticks and doesn't move.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the door of the cab opened, and the girl in brown\r\njumped in.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said breathlessly, \"but would you mind hiding\r\nme, please.\""
