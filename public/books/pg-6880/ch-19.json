    "Troubled Waters\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not easy in this world to take any definite step without annoying\r\nsomebody, and Kirk, in embarking on his wooing of Ruth Bannister,\r\nfailed signally to do so. Lora Delane Porter beamed graciously upon\r\nhim, like a pleased Providence, but the rest of his circle of\r\nacquaintances were ill at ease.\r\n\r\nThe statement does not include Hank Jardine, for Hank was out of New\r\nYork; but the others—Shanklyn, the actor; Wren, the newspaper-man;\r\nBryce, Johnson, Willis, Appleton, and the rest—sensed impending change\r\nin the air, and were uneasy, like cattle before a thunder-storm. The\r\nfact that the visits of Mrs. Porter and Ruth to inquire after George,\r\nnow of daily occurrence, took place in the afternoon, while they,\r\nKirk’s dependents, seldom or never appeared in the studio till drawn\r\nthere by the scent of the evening meal, it being understood that during\r\nthe daytime Kirk liked to work undisturbed, kept them ignorant of the\r\nnew development.\r\n\r\nAll they knew was that during the last two weeks a subtle change had\r\ntaken place in Kirk. He was less genial, more prone to irritability\r\nthan of old. He had developed fits of absent-mindedness, and was\r\nfrequently to be found staring pensively at nothing. To slap him on the\r\nback at such moments, as Wren ventured to do on one occasion, Wren\r\nbelonging to the jovial school of thought which holds that nature gave\r\nus hands in order to slap backs, was to bring forth a new and\r\nunexpected Kirk, a Kirk who scowled and snarled and was hardly to be\r\nappeased with apology. Stranger still, this new Kirk could be summoned\r\ninto existence by precisely the type of story at which, but a few weeks\r\nback, he would have been the first to laugh.\r\n\r\nPercy Shanklyn, whose conversation consisted of equal parts of\r\nautobiography and of stories of the type alluded to, was the one to\r\ndiscover this. His latest, which he had counted on to set the table in\r\na roar, produced from Kirk criticism so adverse and so crisply\r\ndelivered that he refrained from telling his latest but one and spent\r\nthe rest of the evening wondering, like his fellow visitors, what had\r\nhappened to Kirk and whether he was sickening for something.\r\n\r\nNot one of them had the faintest suspicion that these symptoms\r\nindicated that Kirk, for the first time in his easy-going life, was in\r\nlove. They had never contemplated such a prospect. It was not till his\r\nconscientious and laborious courtship had been in progress for over two\r\nweeks and was nearing the stage when he felt that the possibility of\r\nrevealing his state of mind to Ruth was not so remote as it had been,\r\nthat a chance visit of Percy Shanklyn to the studio during the\r\nafternoon solved the mystery.\r\n\r\nOne calls it a chance visit because Percy had not been meaning to\r\nborrow twenty dollars from Kirk that day at all. The man slated for the\r\nloan was one Burrows, a kindly member of the Lambs Club. But fate and a\r\ntelegram from a manager removed Burrows to Chicago, while Percy was\r\nactually circling preparatory to the swoop, and the only other man in\r\nNew York who seemed to Percy good for the necessary sum at that precise\r\nmoment was Kirk.\r\n\r\nHe flew to Kirk and found him with Ruth. Kirk’s utter absence of any\r\nenthusiasm at the sight of him, the reluctance with which he made the\r\nintroduction, the glumness with which he bore his share of the\r\nthree-cornered conversation—all these things convinced Percy that this\r\nwas no ordinary visitor.\r\n\r\nMany years of living by his wits had developed in Percy highly\r\nsensitive powers of observation. Brief as his visit was, he came away\r\nas certain that Kirk was in love with this girl, and the girl was in\r\nlove with Kirk, as he had ever been of anything in his life.\r\n\r\nAs he walked slowly down-town he was thinking hard. The subject\r\noccupying his mind was the problem of how this thing was to be stopped.\r\n\r\nPercy Shanklyn was a sleek, suave, unpleasant youth who had been\r\nimported by a theatrical manager two years before to play the part of\r\nan English dude in a new comedy. The comedy had been what its\r\nenthusiastic backer had described in the newspaper advertisements as a\r\n“rousing live-wire success.” That is to say, it had staggered along for\r\nsix weeks on Broadway to extremely poor houses, and after three weeks\r\non the road, had perished for all time, leaving Percy out of work.\r\n\r\nSince then, no other English dude part having happened along, he had\r\nrested, living in the mysterious way in which out-of-work actors do\r\nlive. He had a number of acquaintances, such as the amiable Burrows,\r\nwho were good for occasional loans, but Kirk Winfield was the king of\r\nthem all. There was something princely about the careless\r\nopen-handedness of Kirk’s methods, and Percy’s whole soul rose in\r\nrevolt against the prospect of being deprived of this source of\r\nrevenue, as something, possibly Ruth’s determined chin, told him that\r\nhe would be, should Kirk marry this girl.\r\n\r\nHe had placed Ruth at once, directly he had heard her name. He\r\nremembered having seen her photograph in the society section of the\r\nSunday paper which he borrowed each week. This was the daughter of old\r\nJohn Bannister. There was no doubt about that. How she had found her\r\nway to Kirk’s studio he could not understand; but there she certainly\r\nwas, and Percy was willing to bet the twenty dollars which, despite the\r\nexcitement of the moment, he had not forgotten to extract from Kirk in\r\na hurried conversation at the door, that her presence there was not\r\nknown and approved by her father.\r\n\r\nThe only reasonable explanation that Kirk was painting her portrait he\r\ndismissed. There had been no signs of any portrait, and Kirk’s\r\nembarrassment had been so obvious that, if there had been any such\r\nexplanation, he would certainly have given it. No, Ruth had been there\r\nfor other reasons than those of art.\r\n\r\n“Unchaperoned, too, by Jove!” thought Percy virtuously, ignorant of\r\nMrs. Lora Delane Porter, who at the time of his call, had been busily\r\noccupied in a back room instilling into George Pennicut the gospel of\r\nthe fit body. For George, now restored to health, had ceased to be a\r\nmere student of “Elementary Rules for the Preservation of the Body” and\r\nhad become an active, though unwilling, practiser of its precepts.\r\n\r\nEvery morning Mrs. Porter called and, having shepherded him into the\r\nback room, put him relentlessly through his exercises. George’s groans,\r\nas he moved his stout limbs along the dotted lines indicated in the\r\nbook’s illustrated plates, might have stirred a faint heart to pity.\r\nBut Lora Delane Porter was made of sterner stuff. If George so much as\r\nbent his knees while touching his toes he heard of it instantly, in no\r\nuncertain voice.\r\n\r\nThus, in her decisive way, did Mrs. Porter spread light and sweetness\r\nwith both hands, achieving the bodily salvation of George while, at the\r\nsame time, furthering the loves of Ruth and Kirk by leaving them alone\r\ntogether to make each other’s better acquaintance in the romantic\r\ndimness of the studio.\r\n\r\n\r\nPercy proceeded down-town, pondering. His first impulse, I regret to\r\nsay, was to send Ruth’s father an anonymous letter. This plan he\r\nabandoned from motives of fear rather than of self-respect. Anonymous\r\nletters are too frequently traced to their writers, and the prospect of\r\nfacing Kirk in such an event did not appeal to him.\r\n\r\nAs he could think of no other way of effecting his object, he had begun\r\nto taste the bitterness of futile effort, when fortune, always his\r\nfriend, put him in a position to do what he wanted in the easiest\r\npossible way with the minimum of unpleasantness.\r\n\r\nBailey Bannister, that strong, keen Napoleon of finance, was not above\r\na little relaxation of an evening when his father happened to be out of\r\ntown. That giant mind, weary with the strain of business, needed\r\nrefreshment.\r\n\r\nAnd so, at eleven thirty that night, his father being in Albany, and\r\nnot expected home till next day, Bailey might have been observed,\r\nbeautifully arrayed and discreetly jovial, partaking of lobster at one\r\nof those Broadway palaces where this fish is in brisk demand. He was in\r\ncompany with his rabbit-faced friend, Clarence Grayling, and two\r\nmembers of the chorus of a neighbouring musical comedy.\r\n\r\nOne of the two, with whom Clarence was conversing in a lively manner\r\nthat showed his heart had not been irreparably broken as the result of\r\nhis recent interview with Ruth, we may dismiss. Like Clarence, she is\r\nof no importance to the story. The other, who, not finding Bailey’s\r\nmeasured remarks very gripping, was allowing her gaze to wander idly\r\naround the room, has this claim to a place in the scheme of things,\r\nthat she had a wordless part in the comedy in which Percy Shanklyn had\r\nappeared as the English dude and was on terms of friendship with him.\r\n\r\nConsequently, seeing him enter the room, as he did at that moment, she\r\nsignalled him to approach.\r\n\r\n“It’s a little feller who was with me in ‘The Man from Out West’,” she\r\nexplained to Bailey as Percy made his way toward them. At which\r\nBailey’s prim mouth closed with an air of disapproval.\r\n\r\nThe feminine element of the stage he found congenial to his\r\nbusiness-harassed brain, but with the “little fellers” who helped them\r\nto keep the national drama sizzling he felt less in sympathy; and he\r\nresented extremely his companion’s tactlessness in inciting this\r\ninfernal mummer to intrude upon his privacy.\r\n\r\nHe prepared to be cold and distant with Percy. And when Bailey, never a\r\nray of sunshine, deliberately tried to be chilly, those with him at the\r\ntime generally had the sensation that winter was once more in their\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\nPercy, meanwhile, threaded his way among the tables, little knowing\r\nthat fate had already solved the problem which had worried him the\r\ngreater part of the day.\r\n\r\nHe had come to the restaurant as a relief from his thoughts. If he\r\ncould find some kind friend who would invite him to supper, well and\r\ngood. If not, he was feeling so tired and depressed that he was ready\r\nto take the bull by the horns and pay for his meal himself. He had\r\nobeyed Miss Freda Reece’s signal because it was impossible to avoid\r\ndoing so; but one glance at Bailey’s face had convinced him that not\r\nthere was his kind host.\r\n\r\n“Why, Perce,” said Miss Reece, “I ain’t saw you in years. Where you\r\nbeen hiding yourself?”\r\n\r\nPercy gave a languid gesture indicative of the man of affairs whose\r\ntime is not his own.\r\n\r\n“Percy,” continued Miss Reece, “shake hands with my friend Mr.\r\nBannister. I been telling him about how you made such a hit as the pin\r\nin ‘Pinafore’!”\r\n\r\nThe name galvanized Percy like a bugle-blast.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bannister!” he exclaimed. “Any relation to Mr. John Bannister, the\r\nmillionaire?”\r\n\r\nBailey favoured him with a scrutiny through the gold-rimmed glasses\r\nwhich would have frozen his very spine.\r\n\r\n“My father’s name is—ah—John, and he is a millionaire.”\r\n\r\nPercy met the scrutiny with a suave smile.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” he said. “I know your sister quite well, Mr. Bannister. I\r\nmeet her frequently at the studio of my friend Kirk Winfield. Very\r\nfrequently. She is there nearly every day. Well, I must be moving on.\r\nGot a date with a man. Goodbye, Freda. Glad you’re going strong. Good\r\nnight, Mr. Bannister. Delighted to have made your acquaintance. You\r\nmust come round to the studio one of these days. Good night.”\r\n\r\nHe moved softly away. Miss Reece watched him go with regret.\r\n\r\n“He’s a good little feller, Percy,” she said. “And so he knows your\r\nsister. Well, ain’t that nice!”\r\n\r\nBailey did not reply. And to the feast of reason and flow of soul that\r\nwent on at the table during the rest of the meal he contributed so\r\nlittle that Miss Reece, in conversation that night with her friend\r\nalluded to him, not without justice, first as “that stiff,” and, later,\r\nas “a dead one.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Percy Shanklyn could have seen Bailey in the small hours of that\r\nnight he would have been satisfied that his words had borne fruit. Like\r\na modern Prometheus, Bailey writhed, sleepless, on his bed till\r\ndaylight appeared. The discovery that Ruth was in the habit of paying\r\nclandestine visits to artists’ studios, where she met men like the\r\nlittle bounder who had been thrust upon him at supper, rent his haughty\r\nsoul like a bomb.\r\n\r\nHe knew no artists, but he had read novels of Bohemian life in Paris,\r\nand he had gathered a general impression that they were, as a class,\r\nshock-headed, unwashed persons of no social standing whatever,\r\nextremely short of money and much addicted to orgies. And his sister\r\nhad lowered herself by association with one of these.\r\n\r\nHe rose early. His appearance in the mirror shocked him. He looked\r\npositively haggard.\r\n\r\nDressing with unwonted haste, he inquired for Ruth, and was told that a\r\ntelephone message had come from her late the previous evening to say\r\nthat she was spending the night at the apartment of Mrs. Lora Delane\r\nPorter. The hated name increased Bailey’s indignation. He held Mrs.\r\nPorter responsible for the whole trouble. But for her pernicious\r\ninfluence, Ruth would have been an ordinary sweet American girl,\r\nrunning as, Bailey held, a girl should, in a decent groove.\r\n\r\nIt increased his troubles that his father was away from New York.\r\nBailey, who enjoyed the dignity of being temporary head of the firm of\r\nBannister & Son, had approved of his departure. But now he would have\r\ngiven much to have him on the spot. He did not doubt his own ability to\r\nhandle this matter, but he felt that his father ought to know what was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nHis wrath against this upstart artist who secretly entertained his\r\nsister in his studio grew with the minutes. It would be his privilege\r\nvery shortly to read that scrubby dauber a lesson in deportment which\r\nhe would remember.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of the family welfare he decided to stay away from the\r\noffice that day. The affairs of Bannister & Son would be safe for the\r\ntime being in the hands of the head clerk. Having telephoned to Wall\r\nStreet to announce his decision, he made a moody breakfast and then\r\nproceeded, as was his custom of a morning, to the gymnasium for his\r\ndaily exercise.\r\n\r\nThe gymnasium was a recent addition to the Bannister home. It had been\r\nestablished as the result of a heart-to-heart talk between old John\r\nBannister and his doctor. The doctor spoke earnestly of nervous\r\nprostration and stated without preamble the exact number of months\r\nwhich would elapse before Mr. Bannister living his present life, would\r\nmake first-hand acquaintance with it. He insisted on a regular routine\r\nof exercise. The gymnasium came into being, and Mr. Steve Dingle,\r\nphysical instructor at the New York Athletic Club, took up a position\r\nin the Bannister household which he was wont to describe to his\r\nnumerous friends as a soft snap.\r\n\r\nCertainly his hours were not long. Thirty minutes with old Mr.\r\nBannister and thirty minutes with Mr. Bailey between eight and nine in\r\nthe morning and his duties were over for the day. But Steve was\r\nconscientious and checked any disposition on the part of his two\r\nclients to shirk work with a firmness which Lora Delane Porter might\r\nhave envied.\r\n\r\nThere were moments when he positively bullied old Mr. Bannister. It\r\nwould have amazed the clerks in his Wall Street office to see the\r\nmeekness with which the old man obeyed orders. But John Bannister was a\r\nman who liked to get his money’s worth, and he knew that Steve was\r\ngiving it to the last cent.\r\n\r\nSteve at that time was twenty-eight years old. He had abandoned an\r\nactive connection with the ring, which had begun just after his\r\nseventeenth birthday, twelve months before his entry into the Bannister\r\nhome, leaving behind him a record of which any boxer might have been\r\nproud. He personally was exceedingly proud of it, and made no secret of\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\nHe was a man in private life of astonishingly even temper. The only\r\nthing that appeared to have the power to ruffle him to the slightest\r\nextent was the contemplation of what he described as the bunch of\r\ncheeses who pretended to fight nowadays. He would have considered it a\r\nprivilege, it seemed, to be allowed to encounter all the middle-weights\r\nin the country in one ring in a single night without training. But it\r\nappeared that he had promised his mother to quit, and he had quit.\r\n\r\nSteve’s mother was an old lady who in her day had been the best\r\nwasherwoman on Cherry Hill. She was, moreover, completely lacking in\r\nall the qualities which go to make up the patroness of sport. Steve had\r\nbeen injudicious enough to pay her a visit the day after his celebrated\r\nunpleasantness with that rugged warrior, Pat O’Flaherty (_ne_ Smith),\r\nand, though he had knocked Pat out midway through the second round, he\r\nbore away from the arena a black eye of such a startling richness that\r\nold Mrs. Dingle had refused to be comforted until he had promised never\r\nto enter the ring again. Which, as Steve said, had come pretty hard, he\r\nbeing a man who would rather be a water-bucket in a ring than a\r\npresident outside it.\r\n\r\nBut he had given the promise, and kept it, leaving the field to the\r\nabove-mentioned bunch of cheeses. There were times when the temptation\r\nto knock the head off Battling Dick this and Fighting Jack that became\r\nalmost agony, but he never yielded to it. All of which suggests that\r\nSteve was a man of character, as indeed he was.\r\n\r\nBailey, entering the gymnasium, found Steve already there, punching the\r\nbag with a force and precision which showed that the bunch of cheeses\r\nought to have been highly grateful to Mrs. Dingle for her\r\nanti-pugilistic prejudices.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Dingle,” said Bailey precisely.\r\n\r\nSteve nodded. Bailey began to don his gymnasium costume. Steve gave the\r\nball a final punch and turned to him. He was a young man who gave the\r\nimpression of being, in a literal sense, perfectly square. This was due\r\nto the breadth of his shoulders, which was quite out of proportion to\r\nhis height. His chest was extraordinarily deep, and his stomach and\r\nwaist small, so that to the observer seeing him for the first time in\r\nboxing trunks, he seemed to begin as a big man and, half-way down,\r\nchange his mind and become a small one.\r\n\r\nHis arms, which were unusually long and thick, hung down nearly to his\r\nknees and were decorated throughout with knobs and ridges of muscle\r\nthat popped up and down and in and out as he moved, in a manner both\r\nfascinating and frightening. His face increased the illusion of\r\nsquareness, for he had thick, straight eyebrows, a straight mouth, and\r\na chin of almost the minimum degree of roundness. He inspected Bailey\r\nwith a pair of brilliant brown eyes which no detail of his appearance\r\ncould escape. And Bailey, that morning, as has been said, was not\r\nlooking his best.\r\n\r\n“You’re lookin’ kind o’ sick, bo,” was Steve’s comment. “I guess you\r\nwas hittin’ it up with the gang last night in one of them lobster\r\nparlours.”\r\n\r\nBailey objected to being addressed as “bo,” and he was annoyed that\r\nSteve should have guessed the truth respecting his overnight movements.\r\nStill more was he annoyed that Steve’s material mind should attribute\r\nto a surfeit of lobster a pallor that was superinduced by a tortured\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n“I did—ah—take supper last night, it is true,” he said. “But if I am a\r\nlittle pale to-day, that is not the cause. Things have occurred to\r\nannoy me intensely.”\r\n\r\n“You should worry!” advised Steve. “Catch!”\r\n\r\nThe heavy medicine-ball struck Bailey in the chest before he could\r\nbring up his hands and sent him staggering back.\r\n\r\n“Damn it, Dingle,” he gasped. “Kindly give me warning before you do\r\nthat sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nSteve was delighted. It amused his simple, honest soul to catch Bailey\r\nnapping, and the incident gave him a text on which to hang a lecture.\r\nAnd, next to fighting, he loved best the sound of his own voice.\r\n\r\n“Warning? Nix!” he said. “Ain’t it just what I been telling you every\r\nday for weeks? You gotta be ready _always_. You seen me holding the\r\npellet. You should oughter have been saying to yourself: ‘I gotta keep\r\nan eye on that gink, so’s he don’t soak me one with that thing when I\r\nain’t looking.’ Then you would have caught it and whizzed it back at\r\nme, and maybe, if I hadn’t been ready for it, you might have knocked\r\nthe breeze out of me.”\r\n\r\n“I should have derived no pleasure——”\r\n\r\n“Why, say, suppose a plug-ugly sasshays up to you on the street to take\r\na crack at your pearl stick-pin, do you reckon he’s going to drop you a\r\npostal card first? You gotta be _ready_ for him. See what I mean?”\r\n\r\n“Let us spar,” said Bailey austerely. He had begun to despair of ever\r\nmaking Steve show him that deference and respect which he considered\r\ndue to the son of the house. The more frigid he was, the more genial\r\nand friendly did Steve become. The thing seemed hopeless.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasing sight to see Bailey spar. He brought to the task the\r\nmeasured dignity which characterized all his actions. A left jab from\r\nhim had all the majesty of a formal declaration of war. If he was a\r\ntrifle slow in his movements for a pastime which demands a certain\r\nagility from its devotees he at least got plenty of exercise and did\r\nhimself a great deal of good.\r\n\r\nHe was perspiring freely as he took off the gloves. A shower-bath,\r\nfollowed by brisk massage at the energetic hands of Steve, made him\r\nfeel better than he had imagined he could feel after that night of\r\nspiritual storm and stress. He was glowing as he put on his clothes,\r\nand a certain high resolve which had come to him in the night watches\r\nnow returned with doubled force.\r\n\r\n“Dingle,” he said, “how did I seem to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Fine,” answered Steve courteously. “You’re gettin’ to be a regular\r\nterror.”\r\n\r\n“You think I shape well?”\r\n\r\n“Sure.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad. This morning I am going to thrash a man within an inch of\r\nhis life.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\nSteve spun round. Bailey’s face was set and determined.\r\n\r\n“You are?” said Steve feebly.\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“What’s he been doing to you?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I cannot tell you that. But he richly deserves what he\r\nwill get.”\r\n\r\nSteve eyed him with affectionate interest.\r\n\r\n“Well, ain’t you the wildcat!” he said. “Who’d have thought it? I’d\r\nalways had you sized up as a kind o’ placid guy.”\r\n\r\n“I can be roused.”\r\n\r\n“Gee, can’t I see it! But, say, what sort of a gook is this gink,\r\nanyway?”\r\n\r\n“In what respect?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean is he a heavy or a middle or a welter or what? It makes a\r\nkind o’ difference, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say. I have not seen him.”\r\n\r\n“What! Not seen him? Then how’s there this fuss between you?”\r\n\r\n“That is a matter into which I cannot go.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what’s his name, then? Maybe I know him. I know a few good\r\npeople in this burg.”\r\n\r\n“I have no objection to telling you that. He is an artist, and his name\r\nis—his name is——”\r\n\r\nWrinkles appeared in Bailey’s forehead. His eyes bulged anxiously\r\nbehind their glasses.\r\n\r\n“I’ve forgotten,” he said blankly.\r\n\r\n“For the love of Mike! Know where he lives?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid not.”\r\n\r\nSteve patted him kindly on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice, bo,” he said. “Let the poor fellow off this time.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that Bailey, instead of falling upon Kirk\r\nWinfield, hailed a taxicab and drove to the apartment of Mrs. Lora\r\nDelane Porter."
