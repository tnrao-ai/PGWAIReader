    "JULIAN EVERSLEIGH\r\n\r\n\r\n_(James Orlebar Cloyster’s narrative continued)_\r\n\r\nI determined to celebrate the occasion by dining out, going to a\r\ntheatre, and having supper afterwards, none of which things were\r\nordinarily within my means. I had not been to a theatre since I had\r\narrived in town; and, except on Saturday nights, I always cooked my own\r\ndinner, a process which was cheap, and which appealed to the passion\r\nfor Bohemianism which I had not wholly cast out of me.\r\n\r\nThe morning paper informed me that there were eleven musical comedies,\r\nthree Shakespeare plays, a blank verse drama, and two comedies (“last\r\nweeks”) for me to choose from. I bought a stall at the Briggs Theatre.\r\nStanley Briggs, who afterwards came to bulk large in my small world,\r\nwas playing there in a musical comedy which had had even more than the\r\ncustomary musical-comedy success.\r\n\r\nLondon by night had always had an immense fascination for me. Coming\r\nout of the restaurant after supper, I felt no inclination to return to\r\nmy lodgings, and end the greatest night of my life tamely with a book\r\nand a pipe. Here was I, a young man, fortified by an excellent supper,\r\nin the heart of Stevenson’s London. Why should I have no New Arabian\r\nNight adventure? I would stroll about for half an hour, and give London\r\na chance of living up to its reputation.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly along Piccadilly, and turned up Rupert Street. A magic\r\nname. Prince Florizel of Bohemia had ended his days there in his\r\ntobacconist’s divan. Mr. Gilbert’s Policeman Forth had been discovered\r\nthere by the men of London at the end of his long wanderings through\r\nSoho. Probably, if the truth were known, Rudolf Rassendyl had spent\r\npart of his time there. It could not be that Rupert Street would send\r\nme empty away.\r\n\r\nMy confidence was not abused. Turning into Rupert Court, a dark and\r\nsuggestive passage some short distance up the street on the right, I\r\nfound a curious little comedy being played.\r\n\r\nA door gave on to the deserted passageway, and on each side of it stood\r\na man—the lurcher type of man that is bred of London streets. The door\r\nopened inwards. Another man stepped out. The hands of one of the\r\nlurchers flew to the newcomer’s mouth. The hands of the other lurcher\r\nflew to the newcomer’s pockets.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I advanced.\r\n\r\nThe lurchers vanished noiselessly and instantaneously.\r\n\r\nTheir victim held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“Come in, won’t you?” he said, smiling sleepily at me.\r\n\r\nI followed him in, murmuring something about “caught in the act.”\r\n\r\nHe repeated the phrase as we went upstairs.\r\n\r\n“‘Caught in the act.’ Yes, they are ingenious creatures. Let me\r\nintroduce myself. My name is Julian Eversleigh. Sit down, won’t you?\r\nExcuse me for a moment.”\r\n\r\nHe crossed to a writing-table.\r\n\r\nJulian Eversleigh inhabited a single room of irregular shape. It was\r\nsmall, and situated immediately under the roof. One side had a window\r\nwhich overlooked Rupert Court. The view from it was, however,\r\nrestricted, because the window was inset, so that the walls projecting\r\non either side prevented one seeing more than a yard or two of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nThe room contained a hammock, a large tin bath, propped up against the\r\nwall, a big wardrobe, a couple of bookcases, a deal writing-table—at\r\nwhich the proprietor was now sitting with a pen in his mouth, gazing at\r\nthe ceiling—and a divan-like formation of rugs and cube sugar boxes.\r\n\r\nThe owner of this mixed lot of furniture wore a very faded blue serge\r\nsuit, the trousers baggy at the knees and the coat threadbare at the\r\nelbows. He had the odd expression which green eyes combined with red\r\nhair give a man.\r\n\r\n“Caught in the act,” he was murmuring. “Caught in the act.”\r\n\r\nThe phrase seemed to fascinate him.\r\n\r\nI had established myself on the divan, and was puffing at a cigar,\r\nwhich I had bought by way of setting the coping-stone on my night’s\r\nextravagance, before he got up from his writing.\r\n\r\n“Those fellows,” he said, producing a bottle of whisky and a syphon\r\nfrom one of the lower drawers of the wardrobe, “did me a double\r\nservice. They introduced me to you—say when—and they gave me——”\r\n\r\n“When.”\r\n\r\n“—an idea.”\r\n\r\n“But how did it happen?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Quite simple,” he answered. “You see, my friends, when they call on me\r\nlate at night, can’t get in by knocking at the front door. It is a\r\nshop-door, and is locked early. Vancott, my landlord, is a baker, and,\r\nas he has to be up making muffins somewhere about five in the\r\nmorning—we all have our troubles—he does not stop up late. So people\r\nwho want me go into the court, and see whether my lamp is burning by\r\nthe window. If it is, they stand below and shout, ‘Julian,’ till I open\r\nthe door into the court. That’s what happened tonight. I heard my name\r\ncalled, went down, and walked into the arms of the enterprising\r\ngentlemen whom you chanced to notice. They must have been very hungry,\r\nfor even if they had carried the job through they could not have\r\nexpected to make their fortunes. In point of fact, they would have\r\ncleared one-and-threepence. But when you’re hungry you can see no\r\nfurther than the pit of your stomach. Do you know, I almost sympathise\r\nwith the poor brutes. People sometimes say to me, ‘What are you?’ I\r\nhave often half a mind to reply, ‘I have been hungry.’ My stars, be\r\nhungry once, and you’re educated, if you don’t die of it, for a\r\nlifetime.”\r\n\r\nThis sort of talk from a stranger might have been the prelude to an\r\nappeal for financial assistance.\r\n\r\nHe dissipated that half-born thought.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be uneasy,” he said; “you have not been lured up here by the\r\nruse of a clever borrower. I can do a bit of touching when in the mood,\r\nmind you, but you’re safe. You are here because I see that you are a\r\npleasant fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” he continued, “I am not hungry at present. In fact, I shall\r\nnever be hungry again.”\r\n\r\n“You’re lucky,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“I am. I am the fortunate possessor of the knack of writing\r\nadvertisements.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” I said, feeling awkward, for I saw that I ought to be\r\nimpressed.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he said, laughing outright. “You’re not impressed in the least,\r\nreally. But I’ll ask you to consider what advertisements mean. First,\r\nthey are the life-essence of every newspaper, every periodical, and\r\nevery book.”\r\n\r\n“Every book?”\r\n\r\n“Practically, yes. Most books contain some latent support of a fashion\r\nin clothes or food or drink, or of some pleasant spot or phase of\r\nbenevolence or vice, all of which form the interest of one or other of\r\nthe sections of society, which sections require publicity at all costs\r\nfor their respective interests.”\r\n\r\nI was about to probe searchingly into so optimistic a view of modern\r\nauthorship, but he stalled me off by proceeding rapidly with his\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\n“Apart, however, from the less obvious modes of advertising, you’ll\r\nagree that this is the age of all ages for the man who can write puffs.\r\n‘Good wine needs no bush’ has become a trade paradox, ‘Judge by\r\nappearances,’ a commercial platitude. The man who is ambitious and\r\nindustrious turns his trick of writing into purely literary channels,\r\nand becomes a novelist. The man who is not ambitious and not\r\nindustrious, and who does not relish the prospect of becoming a loafer\r\nin Strand wine-shops, writes advertisements. The gold-bearing area is\r\nalways growing. It’s a Tom Tiddler’s ground. It is simply a question of\r\npicking up the gold and silver. The industrious man picks up as much as\r\nhe wants. Personally, I am easily content. An occasional nugget\r\nsatisfies me. Here’s tonight’s nugget, for instance.”\r\n\r\nI took the paper he handed to me. It bore the words:\r\n\r\nCAUGHT IN THE ACT\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUGHT IN THE ACT of drinking Skeffington’s Sloe Gin, a man will always\r\npresent a happy and smiling appearance. Skeffington’s Sloe Gin adds a\r\ncrowning pleasure to prosperity, and is a consolation in adversity. Of\r\nall Grocers.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Skeffington’s,” he said, “pay me well. I’m worth money to them, and\r\nthey know it. At present they are giving me a retainer to keep my work\r\nexclusively for them. The stuff they have put on the market is neither\r\nbetter nor worse than the average sloe gin. But my advertisements have\r\ngiven it a tremendous vogue. It is the only brand that grocers stock.\r\nSince I made the firm issue a weekly paper called _Skeffington’s\r\nPoultry Farmer_, free to all country customers, the consumption of sloe\r\ngin has been enormous among agriculturists. My idea, too, of supplying\r\nsuburban buyers gratis with a small drawing-book, skeleton\r\nillustrations, and four coloured chalks, has made the drink popular\r\nwith children. You must have seen the poster I designed. There’s a\r\nreduced copy behind you. The father of a family is unwrapping a bottle\r\nof Skeffington’s Sloe Gin. His little ones crowd round him, laughing\r\nand clapping their hands. The man’s wife is seen peeping roguishly in\r\nthrough the door. Beneath is the popular catch-phrase, “Ain’t mother\r\ngoing to ’ave none?”\r\n\r\n“You’re a genius,” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Hardly that,” he said. “At least, I have no infinite capacity for\r\ntaking pains. I am one of Nature’s slackers. Despite my talent for\r\ndrawing up advertisements, I am often in great straits owing to my\r\nnatural inertia and a passionate love of sleep. I sleep on the\r\nslightest provocation or excuse. I will back myself to sleep against\r\nanyone in the world, no age, weight, or colour barred. You, I should\r\nsay, are of a different temperament. More energetic. The Get On or Get\r\nOut sort of thing. The Young Hustler.”\r\n\r\n“Rather,” I replied briskly, “I am in love.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Julian Eversleigh. “Hopelessly, however. Give us a\r\nmatch.”\r\n\r\nAfter that we confirmed our friendship by smoking a number of pipes\r\ntogether."
