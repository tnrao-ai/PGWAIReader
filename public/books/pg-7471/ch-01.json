Consider the case of Henry\r\nPifield Rice, detective.\r\n\r\nI must explain Henry early, to avoid disappointment. If I simply said\r\nhe was a detective, and let it go at that, I should be obtaining the\r\nreader's interest under false pretences. He was really only a sort of\r\ndetective, a species of sleuth. At Stafford's International\r\nInvestigation Bureau, in the Strand, where he was employed, they did\r\nnot require him to solve mysteries which had baffled the police. He had\r\nnever measured a footprint in his life, and what he did not know about\r\nbloodstains would have filled a library. The sort of job they gave\r\nHenry was to stand outside a restaurant in the rain, and note what time\r\nsomeone inside left it. In short, it is not 'Pifield Rice,\r\nInvestigator. No. 1.--The Adventure of the Maharajah's Ruby' that I\r\nsubmit to your notice, but the unsensational doings of a quite\r\ncommonplace young man, variously known to his comrades at the Bureau as\r\n'Fathead', 'That blighter what's-his-name', and 'Here, you!'\r\n\r\nHenry lived in a boarding-house in Guildford Street. One day a new girl\r\ncame to the boarding-house, and sat next to Henry at meals. Her name\r\nwas Alice Weston. She was small and quiet, and rather pretty. They got\r\non splendidly. Their conversation, at first confined to the weather and\r\nthe moving-pictures, rapidly became more intimate. Henry was surprised\r\nto find that she was on the stage, in the chorus. Previous chorus-girls\r\nat the boarding-house had been of a more pronounced type--good girls,\r\nbut noisy, and apt to wear beauty-spots. Alice Weston was different.\r\n\r\n'I'm rehearsing at present,' she said. 'I'm going out on tour next\r\nmonth in \"The Girl From Brighton\". What do you do, Mr Rice?'\r\n\r\nHenry paused for a moment before replying. He knew how sensational he\r\nwas going to be.\r\n\r\n'I'm a detective.'\r\n\r\nUsually, when he told girls his profession, squeaks of amazed\r\nadmiration greeted him. Now he was chagrined to perceive in the brown\r\neyes that met his distinct disapproval.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?' he said, a little anxiously, for even at this\r\nearly stage in their acquaintance he was conscious of a strong desire\r\nto win her approval. 'Don't you like detectives?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. Somehow I shouldn't have thought you were one.'\r\n\r\nThis restored Henry's equanimity somewhat. Naturally a detective does\r\nnot want to look like a detective and give the whole thing away right\r\nat the start.\r\n\r\n'I think--you won't be offended?'\r\n\r\n'Go on.'\r\n\r\n'I've always looked on it as rather a _sneaky_ job.'\r\n\r\n'Sneaky!' moaned Henry.\r\n\r\n'Well, creeping about, spying on people.'\r\n\r\nHenry was appalled. She had defined his own trade to a nicety. There\r\nmight be detectives whose work was above this reproach, but he was a\r\nconfirmed creeper, and he knew it. It wasn't his fault. The boss told\r\nhim to creep, and he crept. If he declined to creep, he would be sacked\r\n_instanter_. It was hard, and yet he felt the sting of her words,\r\nand in his bosom the first seeds of dissatisfaction with his occupation\r\ntook root.\r\n\r\nYou might have thought that this frankness on the girl's part would\r\nhave kept Henry from falling in love with her. Certainly the dignified\r\nthing would have been to change his seat at table, and take his meals\r\nnext to someone who appreciated the romance of detective work a little\r\nmore. But no, he remained where he was, and presently Cupid, who never\r\nshoots with a surer aim than through the steam of boarding-house hash,\r\nsniped him where he sat.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to Alice Weston. She refused him.\r\n\r\n'It's not because I'm not fond of you. I think you're the nicest man I\r\never met.' A good deal of assiduous attention had enabled Henry to win\r\nthis place in her affections. He had worked patiently and well before\r\nactually putting his fortune to the test. 'I'd marry you tomorrow if\r\nthings were different. But I'm on the stage, and I mean to stick there.\r\nMost of the girls want to get off it, but not me. And one thing I'll\r\nnever do is marry someone who isn't in the profession. My sister\r\nGenevieve did, and look what happened to her. She married a commercial\r\ntraveller, and take it from me he travelled. She never saw him for more\r\nthan five minutes in the year, except when he was selling gent's\r\nhosiery in the same town where she was doing her refined speciality,\r\nand then he'd just wave his hand and whiz by, and start travelling\r\nagain. My husband has got to be close by, where I can see him. I'm\r\nsorry, Henry, but I know I'm right.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed final, but Henry did not wholly despair. He was a resolute\r\nyoung man. You have to be to wait outside restaurants in the rain for\r\nany length of time.\r\n\r\nHe had an inspiration. He sought out a dramatic agent.\r\n\r\n'I want to go on the stage, in musical comedy.'\r\n\r\n'Let's see you dance.'\r\n\r\n'I can't dance.'\r\n\r\n'Sing,' said the agent. 'Stop singing,' added the agent, hastily.\r\n\r\n'You go away and have a nice cup of hot tea,' said the agent,\r\nsoothingly, 'and you'll be as right as anything in the morning.'\r\n\r\nHenry went away.\r\n\r\nA few days later, at the Bureau, his fellow-detective Simmonds hailed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Here, you! The boss wants you. Buck up!'\r\n\r\nMr Stafford was talking into the telephone. He replaced the receiver as\r\nHenry entered.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Rice, here's a woman wants her husband shadowed while he's on the\r\nroad. He's an actor. I'm sending you. Go to this address, and get\r\nphotographs and all particulars. You'll have to catch the eleven\r\no'clock train on Friday.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'He's in \"The Girl From Brighton\" company. They open at Bristol.'\r\n\r\nIt sometimes seemed to Henry as if Fate did it on purpose. If the\r\ncommission had had to do with any other company, it would have been\r\nwell enough, for, professionally speaking, it was the most important\r\nwith which he had ever been entrusted. If he had never met Alice\r\nWeston, and heard her views upon detective work, he would have been\r\npleased and flattered. Things being as they were, it was Henry's\r\nconsidered opinion that Fate had slipped one over on him.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, what torture to be always near her, unable to\r\nreveal himself; to watch her while she disported herself in the company\r\nof other men. He would be disguised, and she would not recognize him;\r\nbut he would recognize her, and his sufferings would be dreadful.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, to have to do his creeping about and spying\r\npractically in her presence--\r\n\r\nStill, business was business.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes to eleven on the morning named he was at the station, a\r\nfalse beard and spectacles shielding his identity from the public eye.\r\nIf you had asked him he would have said that he was a Scotch business\r\nman. As a matter of fact, he looked far more like a motor-car coming\r\nthrough a haystack.\r\n\r\nThe platform was crowded. Friends of the company had come to see the\r\ncompany off. Henry looked on discreetly from behind a stout porter,\r\nwhose bulk formed a capital screen. In spite of himself, he was\r\nimpressed. The stage at close quarters always thrilled him. He\r\nrecognized celebrities. The fat man in the brown suit was Walter\r\nJelliffe, the comedian and star of the company. He stared keenly at him\r\nthrough the spectacles. Others of the famous were scattered about. He\r\nsaw Alice. She was talking to a man with a face like a hatchet, and\r\nsmiling, too, as if she enjoyed it. Behind the matted foliage which he\r\nhad inflicted on his face, Henry's teeth came together with a snap.\r\n\r\nIn the weeks that followed, as he dogged 'The Girl From Brighton'\r\ncompany from town to town, it would be difficult to say whether Henry\r\nwas happy or unhappy. On the one hand, to realize that Alice was so\r\nnear and yet so inaccessible was a constant source of misery; yet, on\r\nthe other, he could not but admit that he was having the very dickens\r\nof a time, loafing round the country like this.\r\n\r\nHe was made for this sort of life, he considered. Fate had placed him\r\nin a London office, but what he really enjoyed was this unfettered\r\ntravel. Some gipsy strain in him rendered even the obvious discomforts\r\nof theatrical touring agreeable. He liked catching trains; he liked\r\ninvading strange hotels; above all, he revelled in the artistic\r\npleasure of watching unsuspecting fellow-men as if they were so many\r\nants.\r\n\r\nThat was really the best part of the whole thing. It was all very well\r\nfor Alice to talk about creeping and spying, but, if you considered it\r\nwithout bias, there was nothing degrading about it at all. It was an\r\nart. It took brains and a genius for disguise to make a man a\r\nsuccessful creeper and spyer. You couldn't simply say to yourself, 'I\r\nwill creep.' If you attempted to do it in your own person, you would be\r\ndetected instantly. You had to be an adept at masking your personality.\r\nYou had to be one man at Bristol and another quite different man at\r\nHull--especially if, like Henry, you were of a gregarious disposition,\r\nand liked the society of actors.\r\n\r\nThe stage had always fascinated Henry. To meet even minor members of\r\nthe profession off the boards gave him a thrill. There was a resting\r\njuvenile, of fit-up calibre, at his boarding-house who could always get\r\na shilling out of him simply by talking about how he had jumped in and\r\nsaved the show at the hamlets which he had visited in the course of his\r\nwanderings. And on this 'Girl From Brighton' tour he was in constant\r\ntouch with men who really amounted to something. Walter Jelliffe had\r\nbeen a celebrity when Henry was going to school; and Sidney Crane, the\r\nbaritone, and others of the lengthy cast, were all players not unknown\r\nin London. Henry courted them assiduously.\r\n\r\nIt had not been hard to scrape acquaintance with them. The principals\r\nof the company always put up at the best hotel, and--his expenses being\r\npaid by his employer--so did Henry. It was the easiest thing possible\r\nto bridge with a well-timed whisky-and-soda the gulf between\r\nnon-acquaintance and warm friendship. Walter Jelliffe, in particular,\r\nwas peculiarly accessible. Every time Henry accosted him--as a\r\ndifferent individual, of course--and renewed in a fresh disguise the\r\nfriendship which he had enjoyed at the last town, Walter Jelliffe met\r\nhim more than half-way.\r\n\r\nIt was in the sixth week of the tour that the comedian, promoting him\r\nfrom mere casual acquaintanceship, invited him to come up to his room\r\nand smoke a cigar.\r\n\r\nHenry was pleased and flattered. Jelliffe was a personage, always\r\nsurrounded by admirers, and the compliment was consequently of a high\r\norder.\r\n\r\nHe lit his cigar. Among his friends at the Green-Room Club it was\r\nunanimously held that Walter Jelliffe's cigars brought him within the\r\nscope of the law forbidding the carrying of concealed weapons; but\r\nHenry would have smoked the gift of such a man if it had been a\r\ncabbage-leaf. He puffed away contentedly. He was made up as an old\r\nIndian colonel that week, and he complimented his host on the aroma\r\nwith a fine old-world courtesy.\r\n\r\nWalter Jelliffe seemed gratified.\r\n\r\n'Quite comfortable?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Quite, I thank you,' said Henry, fondling his silver moustache.\r\n\r\n'That's right. And now tell me, old man, which of us is it you're\r\ntrailing?'\r\n\r\nHenry nearly swallowed his cigar.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, come,' protested Jelliffe; 'there's no need to keep it up with me.\r\nI know you're a detective. The question is, Who's the man you're after?\r\nThat's what we've all been wondering all this time.'\r\n\r\nAll! They had all been wondering! It was worse than Henry could have\r\nimagined. Till now he had pictured his position with regard to 'The\r\nGirl From Brighton' company rather as that of some scientist who,\r\nseeing but unseen, keeps a watchful eye on the denizens of a drop of\r\nwater under his microscope. And they had all detected him--every one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was a stunning blow. If there was one thing on which Henry prided\r\nhimself it was the impenetrability of his disguises. He might be slow;\r\nhe might be on the stupid side; but he could disguise himself. He had a\r\nvariety of disguises, each designed to befog the public more hopelessly\r\nthan the last.\r\n\r\nGoing down the street, you would meet a typical commercial traveller,\r\ndapper and alert. Anon, you encountered a heavily bearded Australian.\r\nLater, maybe, it was a courteous old retired colonel who stopped you\r\nand inquired the way to Trafalgar Square. Still later, a rather flashy\r\nindividual of the sporting type asked you for a match for his cigar.\r\nWould you have suspected for one instant that each of these widely\r\ndiffering personalities was in reality one man?\r\n\r\nCertainly you would.\r\n\r\nHenry did not know it, but he had achieved in the eyes of the small\r\nservant who answered the front-door bell at his boarding-house a\r\nwell-established reputation as a humorist of the more practical kind.\r\nIt was his habit to try his disguises on her. He would ring the bell,\r\ninquire for the landlady, and when Bella had gone, leap up the stairs\r\nto his room. Here he would remove the disguise, resume his normal\r\nappearance, and come downstairs again, humming a careless air. Bella,\r\nmeanwhile, in the kitchen, would be confiding to her ally the cook that\r\n'Mr Rice had jest come in, lookin' sort o' funny again'.\r\n\r\nHe sat and gaped at Walter Jelliffe. The comedian regarded him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n'You look at least a hundred years old,' he said. 'What are you made up\r\nas? A piece of Gorgonzola?'\r\n\r\nHenry glanced hastily at the mirror. Yes, he did look rather old. He\r\nmust have overdone some of the lines on his forehead. He looked\r\nsomething between a youngish centenarian and a nonagenarian who had\r\nseen a good deal of trouble.\r\n\r\n'If you knew how you were demoralizing the company,' Jelliffe went on,\r\n'you would drop it. As steady and quiet a lot of boys as ever you met\r\ntill you came along. Now they do nothing but bet on what disguise\r\nyou're going to choose for the next town. I don't see why you need to\r\nchange so often. You were all right as the Scotchman at Bristol. We\r\nwere all saying how nice you looked. You should have stuck to that. But\r\nwhat do you do at Hull but roll in in a scrubby moustache and a tweed\r\nsuit, looking rotten. However, all that is beside the point. It's a\r\nfree country. If you like to spoil your beauty, I suppose there's no\r\nlaw against it. What I want to know is, who's the man? Whose track are\r\nyou sniffing on, Bill? You'll pardon my calling you Bill. You're known\r\nas Bill the Bloodhound in the company. Who's the man?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind,' said Henry.\r\n\r\nHe was aware, as he made it, that it was not a very able retort, but he\r\nwas feeling too limp for satisfactory repartee. Criticisms in the\r\nBureau, dealing with his alleged solidity of skull, he did not resent.\r\nHe attributed them to man's natural desire to chaff his fellow-man. But\r\nto be unmasked by the general public in this way was another matter. It\r\nstruck at the root of all things.\r\n\r\n'But I do mind,' objected Jelliffe. 'It's most important. A lot of\r\nmoney hangs on it. We've got a sweepstake on in the company, the holder\r\nof the winning name to take the entire receipts. Come on. Who is he?'\r\n\r\nHenry rose and made for the door. His feelings were too deep for words.\r\nEven a minor detective has his professional pride; and the knowledge\r\nthat his espionage is being made the basis of sweepstakes by his quarry\r\ncuts this to the quick.\r\n\r\n'Here, don't go! Where are you going?'\r\n\r\n'Back to London,' said Henry, bitterly. 'It's a lot of good my staying\r\nhere now, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'I should say it was--to me. Don't be in a hurry. You're thinking that,\r\nnow we know all about you, your utility as a sleuth has waned to some\r\nextent. Is that it?'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'Well, why worry? What does it matter to you? You don't get paid by\r\nresults, do you? Your boss said \"Trail along.\" Well, do it, then. I\r\nshould hate to lose you. I don't suppose you know it, but you've been\r\nthe best mascot this tour that I've ever come across. Right from the\r\nstart we've been playing to enormous business. I'd rather kill a black\r\ncat than lose you. Drop the disguises, and stay with us. Come behind\r\nall you want, and be sociable.'\r\n\r\nA detective is only human. The less of a detective, the more human he\r\nis. Henry was not much of a detective, and his human traits were\r\nconsequently highly developed. From a boy, he had never been able to\r\nresist curiosity. If a crowd collected in the street he always added\r\nhimself to it, and he would have stopped to gape at a window with\r\n'Watch this window' written on it, if he had been running for his life\r\nfrom wild bulls. He was, and always had been, intensely desirous of\r\nsome day penetrating behind the scenes of a theatre.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another thing. At last, if he accepted this invitation,\r\nhe would be able to see and speak to Alice Weston, and interfere with\r\nthe manoeuvres of the hatchet-faced man, on whom he had brooded with\r\nsuspicion and jealousy since that first morning at the station. To see\r\nAlice! Perhaps, with eloquence, to talk her out of that ridiculous\r\nresolve of hers!\r\n\r\n'Why, there's something in that,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Rather! Well, that's settled. And now, touching that sweep, who\r\n_is_ it?'\r\n\r\n'I can't tell you that. You see, so far as that goes, I'm just where I\r\nwas before. I can still watch--whoever it is I'm watching.'\r\n\r\n'Dash it, so you can. I didn't think of that,' said Jelliffe, who\r\npossessed a sensitive conscience. 'Purely between ourselves, it isn't\r\n_me_, is it?'\r\n\r\nHenry eyed him inscrutably. He could look inscrutable at times.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' he said, and left quickly, with the feeling that, however poorly\r\nhe had shown up during the actual interview, his exit had been good. He\r\nmight have been a failure in the matter of disguise, but nobody could\r\nhave put more quiet sinister-ness into that 'Ah!' It did much to soothe\r\nhim and ensure a peaceful night's rest.\r\n\r\nOn the following night, for the first time in his life, Henry found\r\nhimself behind the scenes of a theatre, and instantly began to\r\nexperience all the complex emotions which come to the layman in that\r\nsituation. That is to say, he felt like a cat which has strayed into a\r\nstrange hostile back-yard. He was in a new world, inhabited by weird\r\ncreatures, who flitted about in an eerie semi-darkness, like brightly\r\ncoloured animals in a cavern.\r\n\r\n'The Girl From Brighton' was one of those exotic productions specially\r\ndesigned for the Tired Business Man. It relied for a large measure of\r\nits success on the size and appearance of its chorus, and on their\r\nconstant change of costume. Henry, as a consequence, was the centre of\r\na kaleidoscopic whirl of feminine loveliness, dressed to represent\r\nsuch varying flora and fauna as rabbits, Parisian students, colleens,\r\nDutch peasants, and daffodils. Musical comedy is the Irish stew of the\r\ndrama. Anything may be put into it, with the certainty that it will\r\nimprove the general effect.\r\n\r\nHe scanned the throng for a sight of Alice. Often as he had seen the\r\npiece in the course of its six weeks' wandering in the wilderness he\r\nhad never succeeded in recognizing her from the front of the house.\r\nQuite possibly, he thought, she might be on the stage already, hidden\r\nin a rose-tree or some other shrub, ready at the signal to burst forth\r\nupon the audience in short skirts; for in 'The Girl From Brighton'\r\nalmost anything could turn suddenly into a chorus-girl.\r\n\r\nThen he saw her, among the daffodils. She was not a particularly\r\nconvincing daffodil, but she looked good to Henry. With wabbling knees\r\nhe butted his way through the crowd and seized her hand\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n'Why, Henry! Where did you come from?'\r\n\r\n'I _am_ glad to see you!'\r\n\r\n'How did you get here?'\r\n\r\n'I _am_ glad to see you!'\r\n\r\nAt this point the stage-manager, bellowing from the prompt-box, urged\r\nHenry to desist. It is one of the mysteries of behind-the-scenes\r\nacoustics that a whisper from any minor member of the company can be\r\nheard all over the house, while the stage-manager can burst himself\r\nwithout annoying the audience.\r\n\r\nHenry, awed by authority, relapsed into silence. From the unseen stage\r\ncame the sound of someone singing a song about the moon. June was also\r\nmentioned. He recognized the song as one that had always bored him. He\r\ndisliked the woman who was singing it--a Miss Clarice Weaver, who\r\nplayed the heroine of the piece to Sidney Crane's hero.\r\n\r\nIn his opinion he was not alone. Miss Weaver was not popular in the\r\ncompany. She had secured the role rather as a testimony of personal\r\nesteem from the management than because of any innate ability. She sang\r\nbadly, acted indifferently, and was uncertain what to do with her\r\nhands. All these things might have been forgiven her, but she\r\nsupplemented them by the crime known in stage circles as 'throwing her\r\nweight about'. That is to say, she was hard to please, and, when not\r\npleased, apt to say so in no uncertain voice. To his personal friends\r\nWalter Jelliffe had frequently confided that, though not a rich man, he\r\nwas in the market with a substantial reward for anyone who was man\r\nenough to drop a ton of iron on Miss Weaver.\r\n\r\nTonight the song annoyed Henry more than usual, for he knew that very\r\nsoon the daffodils were due on the stage to clinch the verisimilitude\r\nof the scene by dancing the tango with the rabbits. He endeavoured to\r\nmake the most of the time at his disposal.\r\n\r\n'I _am_ glad to see you!' he said.\r\n\r\n'Sh-h!' said the stage-manager.\r\n\r\nHenry was discouraged. Romeo could not have made love under these\r\nconditions. And then, just when he was pulling himself together to\r\nbegin again, she was torn from him by the exigencies of the play.\r\n\r\nHe wandered moodily off into the dusty semi-darkness. He avoided the\r\nprompt-box, whence he could have caught a glimpse of her, being loath\r\nto meet the stage-manager just at present.\r\n\r\nWalter Jelliffe came up to him, as he sat on a box and brooded on life.\r\n\r\n'A little less of the double forte, old man,' he said. 'Miss Weaver has\r\nbeen kicking about the noise on the side. She wanted you thrown out,\r\nbut I said you were my mascot, and I would die sooner than part with\r\nyou. But I should go easy on the chest-notes, I think, all the same.'\r\n\r\nHenry nodded moodily. He was depressed. He had the feeling, which comes\r\nso easily to the intruder behind the scenes, that nobody loved him.\r\n\r\nThe piece proceeded. From the front of the house roars of laughter\r\nindicated the presence on the stage of Walter Jelliffe, while now and\r\nthen a lethargic silence suggested that Miss Clarice Weaver was in\r\naction. From time to time the empty space about him filled with girls\r\ndressed in accordance with the exuberant fancy of the producer of the\r\npiece. When this happened, Henry would leap from his seat and endeavour\r\nto locate Alice; but always, just as he thought he had done so, the\r\nhidden orchestra would burst into melody and the chorus would be called\r\nto the front.\r\n\r\nIt was not till late in the second act that he found an opportunity for\r\nfurther speech.\r\n\r\nThe plot of 'The Girl From Brighton' had by then reached a critical\r\nstage. The situation was as follows: The hero, having been disinherited\r\nby his wealthy and titled father for falling in love with the heroine,\r\na poor shop-girl, has disguised himself (by wearing a different\r\ncoloured necktie) and has come in pursuit of her to a well-known\r\nseaside resort, where, having disguised herself by changing her dress,\r\nshe is serving as a waitress in the Rotunda, on the Esplanade. The\r\nfamily butler, disguised as a Bath-chair man, has followed the hero,\r\nand the wealthy and titled father, disguised as an Italian\r\nopera-singer, has come to the place for a reason which, though\r\nextremely sound, for the moment eludes the memory. Anyhow, he is there,\r\nand they all meet on the Esplanade. Each recognizes the other, but\r\nthinks he himself is unrecognized. _Exeunt_ all, hurriedly,\r\nleaving the heroine alone on the stage.\r\n\r\nIt is a crisis in the heroine's life. She meets it bravely. She sings a\r\nsong entitled 'My Honolulu Queen', with chorus of Japanese girls and\r\nBulgarian officers.\r\n\r\nAlice was one of the Japanese girls.\r\n\r\nShe was standing a little apart from the other Japanese girls. Henry\r\nwas on her with a bound. Now was his time. He felt keyed up, full of\r\npersuasive words. In the interval which had elapsed since their last\r\nconversation yeasty emotions had been playing the dickens with his\r\nself-control. It is practically impossible for a novice, suddenly\r\nintroduced behind the scenes of a musical comedy, not to fall in love\r\nwith somebody; and, if he is already in love, his fervour is increased\r\nto a dangerous point.\r\n\r\nHenry felt that it was now or never. He forgot that it was perfectly\r\npossible--indeed, the reasonable course--to wait till the performance\r\nwas over, and renew his appeal to Alice to marry him on the way back to\r\nher hotel. He had the feeling that he had got just about a quarter of a\r\nminute. Quick action! That was Henry's slogan.\r\n\r\nHe seized her hand.\r\n\r\n'Alice!'\r\n\r\n'Sh-h!' hissed the stage-manager.\r\n\r\n'Listen! I love you. I'm crazy about you. What does it matter whether\r\nI'm on the stage or not? I love you.'\r\n\r\n'Stop that row there!'\r\n\r\n'Won't you marry me?'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him. It seemed to him that she hesitated.\r\n\r\n'Cut it out!' bellowed the stage-manager, and Henry cut it out.\r\n\r\nAnd at this moment, when his whole fate hung in the balance, there came\r\nfrom the stage that devastating high note which is the sign that the\r\nsolo is over and that the chorus are now about to mobilize. As if drawn\r\nby some magnetic power, she suddenly receded from him, and went on to\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\nA man in Henry's position and frame of mind is not responsible for his\r\nactions. He saw nothing but her; he was blind to the fact that\r\nimportant manoeuvres were in progress. All he understood was that she\r\nwas going from him, and that he must stop her and get this thing\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nHe clutched at her. She was out of range, and getting farther away\r\nevery instant.\r\n\r\nHe sprang forward.\r\n\r\nThe advice that should be given to every young man starting life is--if\r\nyou happen to be behind the scenes at a theatre, never spring forward.\r\nThe whole architecture of the place is designed to undo those who so\r\nspring. Hours before, the stage-carpenters have laid their traps, and\r\nin the semi-darkness you cannot but fall into them.\r\n\r\nThe trap into which Henry fell was a raised board. It was not a very\r\nhighly-raised board. It was not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a\r\nchurch-door, but 'twas enough--it served. Stubbing it squarely with his\r\ntoe, Henry shot forward, all arms and legs.\r\n\r\nIt is the instinct of Man, in such a situation, to grab at the nearest\r\nsupport. Henry grabbed at the Hotel Superba, the pride of the\r\nEsplanade. It was a thin wooden edifice, and it supported him for\r\nperhaps a tenth of a second. Then he staggered with it into the\r\nlimelight, tripped over a Bulgarian officer who was inflating himself\r\nfor a deep note, and finally fell in a complicated heap as exactly in\r\nthe centre of the stage as if he had been a star of years' standing.\r\n\r\nIt went well; there was no question of that. Previous audiences had\r\nalways been rather cold towards this particular song, but this one got\r\non its feet and yelled for more. From all over the house came rapturous\r\ndemands that Henry should go back and do it again.\r\n\r\nBut Henry was giving no encores. He rose to his feet, a little stunned,\r\nand automatically began to dust his clothes. The orchestra, unnerved by\r\nthis unrehearsed infusion of new business, had stopped playing.\r\nBulgarian officers and Japanese girls alike seemed unequal to the\r\nsituation. They stood about, waiting for the next thing to break loose.\r\nFrom somewhere far away came faintly the voice of the stage-manager\r\ninventing new words, new combinations of words, and new throat noises.\r\n\r\nAnd then Henry, massaging a stricken elbow, was aware of Miss Weaver at\r\nhis side. Looking up, he caught Miss Weaver's eye.\r\n\r\nA familiar stage-direction of melodrama reads, 'Exit cautious through\r\ngap in hedge'. It was Henry's first appearance on any stage, but he did\r\nit like a veteran.\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow,' said Walter Jelliffe. The hour was midnight, and he\r\nwas sitting in Henry's bedroom at the hotel. Leaving the theatre, Henry\r\nhad gone to bed almost instinctively. Bed seemed the only haven for\r\nhim. 'My dear fellow, don't apologize. You have put me under lasting\r\nobligations. In the first place, with your unerring sense of the stage,\r\nyou saw just the spot where the piece needed livening up, and you\r\nlivened it up. That was good; but far better was it that you also sent\r\nour Miss Weaver into violent hysterics, from which she emerged to hand\r\nin her notice. She leaves us tomorrow.'\r\n\r\nHenry was appalled at the extent of the disaster for which he was\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n'What will you do?'\r\n\r\n'Do! Why, it's what we have all been praying for--a miracle which\r\nshould eject Miss Weaver. It needed a genius like you to come to bring\r\nit off. Sidney Crane's wife can play the part without rehearsal. She\r\nunderstudied it all last season in London. Crane has just been speaking\r\nto her on the phone, and she is catching the night express.'\r\n\r\nHenry sat up in bed.\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'What's the trouble now?'\r\n\r\n'Sidney Crane's wife?'\r\n\r\n'What about her?'\r\n\r\nA bleakness fell upon Henry's soul.\r\n\r\n'She was the woman who was employing me. Now I shall be taken off the\r\njob and have to go back to London.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean that it was really Crane's wife?'\r\n\r\nJelliffe was regarding him with a kind of awe.\r\n\r\n'Laddie,' he said, in a hushed voice, 'you almost scare me. There seems\r\nto be no limit to your powers as a mascot. You fill the house every\r\nnight, you get rid of the Weaver woman, and now you tell me this. I\r\ndrew Crane in the sweep, and I would have taken twopence for my chance\r\nof winning it.'\r\n\r\n'I shall get a telegram from my boss tomorrow recalling me.'\r\n\r\n'Don't go. Stick with me. Join the troupe.'\r\n\r\nHenry stared.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean? I can't sing or act.'\r\n\r\nJelliffe's voice thrilled with earnestness.\r\n\r\n'My boy, I can go down the Strand and pick up a hundred fellows who can\r\nsing and act. I don't want them. I turn them away. But a seventh son of\r\na seventh son like you, a human horseshoe like you, a king of mascots\r\nlike you--they don't make them nowadays. They've lost the pattern. If\r\nyou like to come with me I'll give you a contract for any number of\r\nyears you suggest. I need you in my business.' He rose. 'Think it over,\r\nladdie, and let me know tomorrow. Look here upon this picture, and on\r\nthat. As a sleuth you are poor. You couldn't detect a bass-drum in a\r\ntelephone-booth. You have no future. You are merely among those\r\npresent. But as a mascot--my boy, you're the only thing in sight. You\r\ncan't help succeeding on the stage. You don't have to know how to act.\r\nLook at the dozens of good actors who are out of jobs. Why? Unlucky. No\r\nother reason. With your luck and a little experience you'll be a star\r\nbefore you know you've begun. Think it over, and let me know in the\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\nBefore Henry's eyes there rose a sudden vision of Alice: Alice no\r\nlonger unattainable; Alice walking on his arm down the aisle; Alice\r\nmending his socks; Alice with her heavenly hands fingering his salary\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n'Don't go,' he said. 'Don't go. I'll let you know now.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scene is the Strand, hard by Bedford Street; the time, that restful\r\nhour of the afternoon when they of the gnarled faces and the bright\r\nclothing gather together in groups to tell each other how good they\r\nare.\r\n\r\nHark! A voice.\r\n\r\n'Rather! Courtneidge and the Guv'nor keep on trying to get me, but I\r\nturn them down every time. \"No,\" I said to Malone only yesterday, \"not\r\nfor me! I'm going with old Wally Jelliffe, the same as usual, and there\r\nisn't the money in the Mint that'll get me away.\" Malone got all worked\r\nup. He--'\r\n\r\nIt is the voice of Pifield Rice, actor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRICATING YOUNG GUSSIE\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sprang it on me before breakfast. There in seven words you have a\r\ncomplete character sketch of my Aunt Agatha. I could go on indefinitely\r\nabout brutality and lack of consideration. I merely say that she routed\r\nme out of bed to listen to her painful story somewhere in the small\r\nhours. It can't have been half past eleven when Jeeves, my man, woke me\r\nout of the dreamless and broke the news:\r\n\r\n'Mrs Gregson to see you, sir.'\r\n\r\nI thought she must be walking in her sleep, but I crawled out of bed\r\nand got into a dressing-gown. I knew Aunt Agatha well enough to know\r\nthat, if she had come to see me, she was going to see me. That's the\r\nsort of woman she is.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting bolt upright in a chair, staring into space. When I\r\ncame in she looked at me in that darn critical way that always makes me\r\nfeel as if I had gelatine where my spine ought to be. Aunt Agatha is\r\none of those strong-minded women. I should think Queen Elizabeth must\r\nhave been something like her. She bosses her husband, Spencer Gregson,\r\na battered little chappie on the Stock Exchange. She bosses my cousin,\r\nGussie Mannering-Phipps. She bosses her sister-in-law, Gussie's mother.\r\nAnd, worst of all, she bosses me. She has an eye like a man-eating\r\nfish, and she has got moral suasion down to a fine point.\r\n\r\nI dare say there are fellows in the world--men of blood and iron, don't\r\nyou know, and all that sort of thing--whom she couldn't intimidate; but\r\nif you're a chappie like me, fond of a quiet life, you simply curl into\r\na ball when you see her coming, and hope for the best. My experience is\r\nthat when Aunt Agatha wants you to do a thing you do it, or else you\r\nfind yourself wondering why those fellows in the olden days made such a\r\nfuss when they had trouble with the Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\n'Halloa, Aunt Agatha!' I said\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' she said, 'you look a sight. You look perfectly dissipated.'\r\n\r\nI was feeling like a badly wrapped brown-paper parcel. I'm never at my\r\nbest in the early morning. I said so.\r\n\r\n'Early morning! I had breakfast three hours ago, and have been walking\r\nin the park ever since, trying to compose my thoughts.'\r\n\r\nIf I ever breakfasted at half past eight I should walk on the\r\nEmbankment, trying to end it all in a watery grave.\r\n\r\n'I am extremely worried, Bertie. That is why I have come to you.'\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw she was going to start something, and I bleated weakly\r\nto Jeeves to bring me tea. But she had begun before I could get it.\r\n\r\n'What are your immediate plans, Bertie?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I rather thought of tottering out for a bite of lunch later on,\r\nand then possibly staggering round to the club, and after that, if I\r\nfelt strong enough, I might trickle off to Walton Heath for a round of\r\ngolf.'\r\n\r\nI am not interested in your totterings and tricklings. I mean, have you\r\nany important engagements in the next week or so?'\r\n\r\nI scented danger.\r\n\r\n'Rather,' I said. 'Heaps! Millions! Booked solid!'\r\n\r\n'What are they?'\r\n\r\n'I--er--well, I don't quite know.'\r\n\r\n'I thought as much. You have no engagements. Very well, then, I want\r\nyou to start immediately for America.'\r\n\r\n'America!'\r\n\r\nDo not lose sight of the fact that all this was taking place on an\r\nempty stomach, shortly after the rising of the lark.\r\n\r\n'Yes, America. I suppose even you have heard of America?'\r\n\r\n'But why America?'\r\n\r\n'Because that is where your Cousin Gussie is. He is in New York, and I\r\ncan't get at him.'\r\n\r\n'What's Gussie been doing?'\r\n\r\n'Gussie is making a perfect idiot of himself.'\r\n\r\nTo one who knew young Gussie as well as I did, the words opened up a\r\nwide field for speculation.\r\n\r\n'In what way?'\r\n\r\n'He has lost his head over a creature.'\r\n\r\nOn past performances this rang true. Ever since he arrived at man's\r\nestate Gussie had been losing his head over creatures. He's that sort\r\nof chap. But, as the creatures never seemed to lose their heads over\r\nhim, it had never amounted to much.\r\n\r\n'I imagine you know perfectly well why Gussie went to America, Bertie.\r\nYou know how wickedly extravagant your Uncle Cuthbert was.'\r\n\r\nShe alluded to Gussie's governor, the late head of the family, and I am\r\nbound to say she spoke the truth. Nobody was fonder of old Uncle\r\nCuthbert than I was, but everybody knows that, where money was\r\nconcerned, he was the most complete chump in the annals of the nation.\r\nHe had an expensive thirst. He never backed a horse that didn't get\r\nhousemaid's knee in the middle of the race. He had a system of beating\r\nthe bank at Monte Carlo which used to make the administration hang out\r\nthe bunting and ring the joy-bells when he was sighted in the offing.\r\nTake him for all in all, dear old Uncle Cuthbert was as willing a\r\nspender as ever called the family lawyer a bloodsucking vampire because\r\nhe wouldn't let Uncle Cuthbert cut down the timber to raise another\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n'He left your Aunt Julia very little money for a woman in her\r\nposition. Beechwood requires a great deal of keeping up, and\r\npoor dear Spencer, though he does his best to help, has not\r\nunlimited resources. It was clearly understood why Gussie went\r\nto America. He is not clever, but he is very good-looking, and,\r\nthough he has no title, the Mannering-Phippses are one of the best\r\nand oldest families in England. He had some excellent letters of\r\nintroduction, and when he wrote home to say that he had met the\r\nmost charming and beautiful girl in the world I felt quite happy.\r\nHe continued to rave about her for several mails, and then this\r\nmorning a letter has come from him in which he says, quite casually\r\nas a sort of afterthought, that he knows we are broadminded enough\r\nnot to think any the worse of her because she is on the vaudeville\r\nstage.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say!'\r\n\r\n'It was like a thunderbolt. The girl's name, it seems, is Ray Denison,\r\nand according to Gussie she does something which he describes as a\r\nsingle on the big time. What this degraded performance may be I have\r\nnot the least notion. As a further recommendation he states that she\r\nlifted them out of their seats at Mosenstein's last week. Who she may\r\nbe, and how or why, and who or what Mr Mosenstein may be, I cannot tell\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'By jove,' I said, 'it's like a sort of thingummybob, isn't it? A sort\r\nof fate, what?'\r\n\r\n'I fail to understand you.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Aunt Julia, you know, don't you know? Heredity, and so forth.\r\nWhat's bred in the bone will come out in the wash, and all that kind of\r\nthing, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be absurd, Bertie.'\r\n\r\nThat was all very well, but it was a coincidence for all that. Nobody\r\never mentions it, and the family have been trying to forget it for\r\ntwenty-five years, but it's a known fact that my Aunt Julia, Gussie's\r\nmother, was a vaudeville artist once, and a very good one, too, I'm\r\ntold. She was playing in pantomime at Drury Lane when Uncle Cuthbert\r\nsaw her first. It was before my time, of course, and long before I was\r\nold enough to take notice the family had made the best of it, and Aunt\r\nAgatha had pulled up her socks and put in a lot of educative work, and\r\nwith a microscope you couldn't tell Aunt Julia from a genuine\r\ndyed-in-the-wool aristocrat. Women adapt themselves so quickly!\r\n\r\nI have a pal who married Daisy Trimble of the Gaiety, and when I meet\r\nher now I feel like walking out of her presence backwards. But there\r\nthe thing was, and you couldn't get away from it. Gussie had vaudeville\r\nblood in him, and it looked as if he were reverting to type, or\r\nwhatever they call it.\r\n\r\n'By Jove,' I said, for I am interested in this heredity stuff, 'perhaps\r\nthe thing is going to be a regular family tradition, like you read\r\nabout in books--a sort of Curse of the Mannering-Phippses, as it were.\r\nPerhaps each head of the family's going to marry into vaudeville for\r\never and ever. Unto the what-d'you-call-it generation, don't you know?'\r\n\r\n'Please do not be quite idiotic, Bertie. There is one head of the\r\nfamily who is certainly not going to do it, and that is Gussie. And you\r\nare going to America to stop him.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but why me?'\r\n\r\n'Why you? You are too vexing, Bertie. Have you no sort of feeling for\r\nthe family? You are too lazy to try to be a credit to yourself, but at\r\nleast you can exert yourself to prevent Gussie's disgracing us. You are\r\ngoing to America because you are Gussie's cousin, because you have\r\nalways been his closest friend, because you are the only one of the\r\nfamily who has absolutely nothing to occupy his time except golf and\r\nnight clubs.'\r\n\r\n'I play a lot of auction.'\r\n\r\n'And as you say, idiotic gambling in low dens. If you require another\r\nreason, you are going because I ask you as a personal favour.'\r\n\r\nWhat she meant was that, if I refused, she would exert the full bent of\r\nher natural genius to make life a Hades for me. She held me with her\r\nglittering eye. I have never met anyone who can give a better imitation\r\nof the Ancient Mariner.\r\n\r\n'So you will start at once, won't you, Bertie?'\r\n\r\nI didn't hesitate.\r\n\r\n'Rather!' I said. 'Of course I will'\r\n\r\nJeeves came in with the tea.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'we start for America on Saturday.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir,' he said; 'which suit will you wear?'\r\n\r\nNew York is a large city conveniently situated on the edge of America,\r\nso that you step off the liner right on to it without an effort. You\r\ncan't lose your way. You go out of a barn and down some stairs, and\r\nthere you are, right in among it. The only possible objection any\r\nreasonable chappie could find to the place is that they loose you into\r\nit from the boat at such an ungodly hour.\r\n\r\nI left Jeeves to get my baggage safely past an aggregation of\r\nsuspicious-minded pirates who were digging for buried treasures among\r\nmy new shirts, and drove to Gussie's hotel, where I requested the squad\r\nof gentlemanly clerks behind the desk to produce him.\r\n\r\nThat's where I got my first shock. He wasn't there. I pleaded with them\r\nto think again, and they thought again, but it was no good. No Augustus\r\nMannering-Phipps on the premises.\r\n\r\nI admit I was hard hit. There I was alone in a strange city and no\r\nsigns of Gussie. What was the next step? I am never one of the master\r\nminds in the early morning; the old bean doesn't somehow seem to get\r\ninto its stride till pretty late in the p.m.'s, and I couldn't think\r\nwhat to do. However, some instinct took me through a door at the back\r\nof the lobby, and I found myself in a large room with an enormous\r\npicture stretching across the whole of one wall, and under the picture\r\na counter, and behind the counter divers chappies in white, serving\r\ndrinks. They have barmen, don't you know, in New York, not barmaids.\r\nRum idea!\r\n\r\nI put myself unreservedly into the hands of one of the white chappies.\r\nHe was a friendly soul, and I told him the whole state of affairs. I\r\nasked him what he thought would meet the case.\r\n\r\nHe said that in a situation of that sort he usually prescribed a\r\n'lightning whizzer', an invention of his own. He said this was what\r\nrabbits trained on when they were matched against grizzly bears, and\r\nthere was only one instance on record of the bear having lasted three\r\nrounds. So I tried a couple, and, by Jove! the man was perfectly right.\r\nAs I drained the second a great load seemed to fall from my heart, and\r\nI went out in quite a braced way to have a look at the city.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find the streets quite full. People were bustling\r\nalong as if it were some reasonable hour and not the grey dawn. In the\r\ntramcars they were absolutely standing on each other's necks. Going to\r\nbusiness or something, I take it. Wonderful johnnies!\r\n\r\nThe odd part of it was that after the first shock of seeing all this\r\nfrightful energy the thing didn't seem so strange. I've spoken to\r\nfellows since who have been to New York, and they tell me they found it\r\njust the same. Apparently there's something in the air, either the\r\nozone or the phosphates or something, which makes you sit up and take\r\nnotice. A kind of zip, as it were. A sort of bally freedom, if you know\r\nwhat I mean, that gets into your blood and bucks you up, and makes you\r\nfeel that--\r\n\r\n    _God's in His Heaven:\r\n    All's right with the world_,\r\n\r\nand you don't care if you've got odd socks on. I can't express it\r\nbetter than by saying that the thought uppermost in my mind, as I\r\nwalked about the place they call Times Square, was that there were\r\nthree thousand miles of deep water between me and my Aunt Agatha.\r\n\r\nIt's a funny thing about looking for things. If you hunt for a needle\r\nin a haystack you don't find it. If you don't give a darn whether you\r\never see the needle or not it runs into you the first time you lean\r\nagainst the stack. By the time I had strolled up and down once or\r\ntwice, seeing the sights and letting the white chappie's corrective\r\npermeate my system, I was feeling that I wouldn't care if Gussie and I\r\nnever met again, and I'm dashed if I didn't suddenly catch sight of the\r\nold lad, as large as life, just turning in at a doorway down the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nI called after him, but he didn't hear me, so I legged it in pursuit\r\nand caught him going into an office on the first floor. The name on the\r\ndoor was Abe Riesbitter, Vaudeville Agent, and from the other side of\r\nthe door came the sound of many voices.\r\n\r\nHe turned and stared at me.\r\n\r\n'Bertie! What on earth are you doing? Where have you sprung from? When\r\ndid you arrive?'\r\n\r\n'Landed this morning. I went round to your hotel, but they said you\r\nweren't there. They had never heard of you.'\r\n\r\n'I've changed my name. I call myself George Wilson.'\r\n\r\n'Why on earth?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you try calling yourself Augustus Mannering-Phipps over here,\r\nand see how it strikes you. You feel a perfect ass. I don't know what\r\nit is about America, but the broad fact is that it's not a place where\r\nyou can call yourself Augustus Mannering-Phipps. And there's another\r\nreason. I'll tell you later. Bertie, I've fallen in love with the\r\ndearest girl in the world.'\r\n\r\nThe poor old nut looked at me in such a deuced cat-like way, standing\r\nwith his mouth open, waiting to be congratulated, that I simply hadn't\r\nthe heart to tell him that I knew all about that already, and had come\r\nover to the country for the express purpose of laying him a stymie.\r\n\r\nSo I congratulated him.\r\n\r\n'Thanks awfully, old man,' he said. 'It's a bit premature, but I fancy\r\nit's going to be all right. Come along in here, and I'll tell you about\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'What do you want in this place? It looks a rummy spot.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that's part of the story. I'll tell you the whole thing.'\r\n\r\nWe opened the door marked 'Waiting Room'. I never saw such a crowded\r\nplace in my life. The room was packed till the walls bulged.\r\n\r\nGussie explained.\r\n\r\n'Pros,' he said, 'music-hall artistes, you know, waiting to see old Abe\r\nRiesbitter. This is September the first, vaudeville's opening day. The\r\nearly fall,' said Gussie, who is a bit of a poet in his way, 'is\r\nvaudeville's springtime. All over the country, as August wanes,\r\nsparkling comediennes burst into bloom, the sap stirs in the veins of\r\ntramp cyclists, and last year's contortionists, waking from their\r\nsummer sleep, tie themselves tentatively into knots. What I mean is,\r\nthis is the beginning of the new season, and everybody's out hunting\r\nfor bookings.'\r\n\r\n'But what do you want here?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I've just got to see Abe about something. If you see a fat man\r\nwith about fifty-seven chins come out of that door there grab him, for\r\nthat'll be Abe. He's one of those fellows who advertise each step up\r\nthey take in the world by growing another chin. I'm told that way back\r\nin the nineties he only had two. If you do grab Abe, remember that he\r\nknows me as George Wilson.'\r\n\r\n'You said that you were going to explain that George Wilson business to\r\nme, Gussie, old man.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's this way--'\r\n\r\nAt this juncture dear old Gussie broke off short, rose from his seat,\r\nand sprang with indescribable vim at an extraordinarily stout chappie\r\nwho had suddenly appeared. There was the deuce of a rush for him, but\r\nGussie had got away to a good start, and the rest of the singers,\r\ndancers, jugglers, acrobats, and refined sketch teams seemed to\r\nrecognize that he had won the trick, for they ebbed back into their\r\nplaces again, and Gussie and I went into the inner room.\r\n\r\nMr Riesbitter lit a cigar, and looked at us solemnly over his zareba of\r\nchins.\r\n\r\n'Now, let me tell ya something,' he said to Gussie. 'You lizzun t' me.'\r\n\r\nGussie registered respectful attention. Mr Riesbitter mused for a\r\nmoment and shelled the cuspidor with indirect fire over the edge of the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n'Lizzun t' me,' he said again. 'I seen you rehearse, as I promised Miss\r\nDenison I would. You ain't bad for an amateur. You gotta lot to learn,\r\nbut it's in you. What it comes to is that I can fix you up in the\r\nfour-a-day, if you'll take thirty-five per. I can't do better than\r\nthat, and I wouldn't have done that if the little lady hadn't of kep'\r\nafter me. Take it or leave it. What do you say?'\r\n\r\n'I'll take it,' said Gussie, huskily. 'Thank you.'\r\n\r\nIn the passage outside, Gussie gurgled with joy and slapped me on the\r\nback. 'Bertie, old man, it's all right. I'm the happiest man in New\r\nYork.'\r\n\r\n'Now what?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, as I was telling you when Abe came in, Ray's father\r\nused to be in the profession. He was before our time, but I remember\r\nhearing about him--Joe Danby. He used to be well known in London before\r\nhe came over to America. Well, he's a fine old boy, but as obstinate as\r\na mule, and he didn't like the idea of Ray marrying me because I wasn't\r\nin the profession. Wouldn't hear of it. Well, you remember at Oxford I\r\ncould always sing a song pretty well; so Ray got hold of old Riesbitter\r\nand made him promise to come and hear me rehearse and get me bookings\r\nif he liked my work. She stands high with him. She coached me for\r\nweeks, the darling. And now, as you heard him say, he's booked me in\r\nthe small time at thirty-five dollars a week.'\r\n\r\nI steadied myself against the wall. The effects of the restoratives\r\nsupplied by my pal at the hotel bar were beginning to work off, and I\r\nfelt a little weak. Through a sort of mist I seemed to have a vision of\r\nAunt Agatha hearing that the head of the Mannering-Phippses was about\r\nto appear on the vaudeville stage. Aunt Agatha's worship of the family\r\nname amounts to an obsession. The Mannering-Phippses were an\r\nold-established clan when William the Conqueror was a small boy going\r\nround with bare legs and a catapult. For centuries they have called\r\nkings by their first names and helped dukes with their weekly rent; and\r\nthere's practically nothing a Mannering-Phipps can do that doesn't blot\r\nhis escutcheon. So what Aunt Agatha would say--beyond saying that it\r\nwas all my fault--when she learned the horrid news, it was beyond me to\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\n'Come back to the hotel, Gussie,' I said. 'There's a sportsman there\r\nwho mixes things he calls \"lightning whizzers\". Something tells me I\r\nneed one now. And excuse me for one minute, Gussie. I want to send a\r\ncable.'\r\n\r\nIt was clear to me by now that Aunt Agatha had picked the wrong man for\r\nthis job of disentangling Gussie from the clutches of the American\r\nvaudeville profession. What I needed was reinforcements. For a moment I\r\nthought of cabling Aunt Agatha to come over, but reason told me that\r\nthis would be overdoing it. I wanted assistance, but not so badly as\r\nthat. I hit what seemed to me the happy mean. I cabled to Gussie's\r\nmother and made it urgent.\r\n\r\n'What were you cabling about?' asked Gussie, later.\r\n\r\n'Oh just to say I had arrived safely, and all that sort of tosh,' I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGussie opened his vaudeville career on the following Monday at a rummy\r\nsort of place uptown where they had moving pictures some of the time\r\nand, in between, one or two vaudeville acts. It had taken a lot of\r\ncareful handling to bring him up to scratch. He seemed to take my\r\nsympathy and assistance for granted, and I couldn't let him down. My\r\nonly hope, which grew as I listened to him rehearsing, was that he\r\nwould be such a frightful frost at his first appearance that he would\r\nnever dare to perform again; and, as that would automatically squash\r\nthe marriage, it seemed best to me to let the thing go on.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't taking any chances. On the Saturday and Sunday we practically\r\nlived in a beastly little music-room at the offices of the publishers\r\nwhose songs he proposed to use. A little chappie with a hooked nose\r\nsucked a cigarette and played the piano all day. Nothing could tire\r\nthat lad. He seemed to take a personal interest in the thing.\r\n\r\nGussie would cleat his throat and begin:\r\n\r\n'There's a great big choo-choo waiting at the deepo.'\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPPIE (playing chords): 'Is that so? What's it waiting for?'\r\n\r\nGUSSIE (rather rattled at the interruption): 'Waiting for me.'\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPPIE (surprised): For you?'\r\n\r\nGUSSIE (sticking to it): 'Waiting for me-e-ee!'\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPPIE (sceptically): 'You don't say!'\r\n\r\nGUSSIE: 'For I'm off to Tennessee.'\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPPIE (conceding a point): 'Now, I live at Yonkers.'\r\n\r\nHe did this all through the song. At first poor old Gussie asked him to\r\nstop, but the chappie said, No, it was always done. It helped to get\r\npep into the thing. He appealed to me whether the thing didn't want a\r\nbit of pep, and I said it wanted all the pep it could get. And the\r\nchappie said to Gussie, 'There you are!' So Gussie had to stand it.\r\n\r\nThe other song that he intended to sing was one of those moon songs. He\r\ntold me in a hushed voice that he was using it because it was one of\r\nthe songs that the girl Ray sang when lifting them out of their seats\r\nat Mosenstein's and elsewhere. The fact seemed to give it sacred\r\nassociations for him.\r\n\r\nYou will scarcely believe me, but the management expected Gussie to\r\nshow up and start performing at one o'clock in the afternoon. I told\r\nhim they couldn't be serious, as they must know that he would be\r\nrolling out for a bit of lunch at that hour, but Gussie said this was\r\nthe usual thing in the four-a-day, and he didn't suppose he would ever\r\nget any lunch again until he landed on the big time. I was just\r\ncondoling with him, when I found that he was taking it for granted that\r\nI should be there at one o'clock, too. My idea had been that I should\r\nlook in at night, when--if he survived--he would be coming up for the\r\nfourth time; but I've never deserted a pal in distress, so I said\r\ngood-bye to the little lunch I'd been planning at a rather decent\r\ntavern I'd discovered on Fifth Avenue, and trailed along. They were\r\nshowing pictures when I reached my seat. It was one of those Western\r\nfilms, where the cowboy jumps on his horse and rides across country at\r\na hundred and fifty miles an hour to escape the sheriff, not knowing,\r\npoor chump! that he might just as well stay where he is, the sheriff\r\nhaving a horse of his own which can do three hundred miles an hour\r\nwithout coughing. I was just going to close my eyes and try to forget\r\ntill they put Gussie's name up when I discovered that I was sitting\r\nnext to a deucedly pretty girl.\r\n\r\nNo, let me be honest. When I went in I had seen that there was a\r\ndeucedly pretty girl sitting in that particular seat, so I had taken\r\nthe next one. What happened now was that I began, as it were, to drink\r\nher in. I wished they would turn the lights up so that I could see her\r\nbetter. She was rather small, with great big eyes and a ripping smile.\r\nIt was a shame to let all that run to seed, so to speak, in\r\nsemi-darkness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the lights did go up, and the orchestra began to play a tune\r\nwhich, though I haven't much of an ear for music, seemed somehow\r\nfamiliar. The next instant out pranced old Gussie from the wings in a\r\npurple frock-coat and a brown top-hat, grinned feebly at the audience,\r\ntripped over his feet, blushed, and began to sing the Tennessee song.\r\n\r\nIt was rotten. The poor nut had got stage fright so badly that it\r\npractically eliminated his voice. He sounded like some far-off echo of\r\nthe past 'yodelling' through a woollen blanket.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since I had heard that he was about to go into\r\nvaudeville I felt a faint hope creeping over me. I was sorry for the\r\nwretched chap, of course, but there was no denying that the thing had\r\nits bright side. No management on earth would go on paying thirty-five\r\ndollars a week for this sort of performance. This was going to be\r\nGussie's first and only. He would have to leave the profession. The old\r\nboy would say, 'Unhand my daughter'. And, with decent luck, I saw\r\nmyself leading Gussie on to the next England-bound liner and handing\r\nhim over intact to Aunt Agatha.\r\n\r\nHe got through the song somehow and limped off amidst roars of silence\r\nfrom the audience. There was a brief respite, then out he came again.\r\n\r\nHe sang this time as if nobody loved him. As a song, it was not a very\r\npathetic song, being all about coons spooning in June under the moon,\r\nand so on and so forth, but Gussie handled it in such a sad, crushed\r\nway that there was genuine anguish in every line. By the time he\r\nreached the refrain I was nearly in tears. It seemed such a rotten sort\r\nof world with all that kind of thing going on in it.\r\n\r\nHe started the refrain, and then the most frightful thing happened. The\r\ngirl next to me got up in her seat, chucked her head back, and began to\r\nsing too. I say 'too', but it wasn't really too, because her first note\r\nstopped Gussie dead, as if he had been pole-axed.\r\n\r\nI never felt so bally conspicuous in my life. I huddled down in my seat\r\nand wished I could turn my collar up. Everybody seemed to be looking at\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of my agony I caught sight of Gussie. A complete change\r\nhad taken place in the old lad. He was looking most frightfully bucked.\r\nI must say the girl was singing most awfully well, and it seemed to act\r\non Gussie like a tonic. When she came to the end of the refrain, he\r\ntook it up, and they sang it together, and the end of it was that he\r\nwent off the popular hero. The audience yelled for more, and were only\r\nquieted when they turned down the lights and put on a film.\r\n\r\nWhen I had recovered I tottered round to see Gussie. I found him\r\nsitting on a box behind the stage, looking like one who had seen\r\nvisions.\r\n\r\n'Isn't she a wonder, Bertie?' he said, devoutly. 'I hadn't a notion she\r\nwas going to be there. She's playing at the Auditorium this week, and\r\nshe can only just have had time to get back to her _matinee_. She\r\nrisked being late, just to come and see me through. She's my good\r\nangel, Bertie. She saved me. If she hadn't helped me out I don't know\r\nwhat would have happened. I was so nervous I didn't know what I was\r\ndoing. Now that I've got through the first show I shall be all right.'\r\n\r\nI was glad I had sent that cable to his mother. I was going to need\r\nher. The thing had got beyond me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the next week I saw a lot of old Gussie, and was introduced to\r\nthe girl. I also met her father, a formidable old boy with quick\r\neyebrows and a sort of determined expression. On the following\r\nWednesday Aunt Julia arrived. Mrs Mannering-Phipps, my aunt Julia, is,\r\nI think, the most dignified person I know. She lacks Aunt Agatha's\r\npunch, but in a quiet way she has always contrived to make me feel,\r\nfrom boyhood up, that I was a poor worm. Not that she harries me like\r\nAunt Agatha. The difference between the two is that Aunt Agatha conveys\r\nthe impression that she considers me personally responsible for all the\r\nsin and sorrow in the world, while Aunt Julia's manner seems to suggest\r\nthat I am more to be pitied than censured.\r\n\r\nIf it wasn't that the thing was a matter of historical fact, I should\r\nbe inclined to believe that Aunt Julia had never been on the vaudeville\r\nstage. She is like a stage duchess.\r\n\r\nShe always seems to me to be in a perpetual state of being about to\r\ndesire the butler to instruct the head footman to serve lunch in the\r\nblue-room overlooking the west terrace. She exudes dignity. Yet,\r\ntwenty-five years ago, so I've been told by old boys who were lads\r\nabout town in those days, she was knocking them cold at the Tivoli in a\r\ndouble act called 'Fun in a Tea-Shop', in which she wore tights and\r\nsang a song with a chorus that began, 'Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay'.\r\n\r\nThere are some things a chappie's mind absolutely refuses to picture,\r\nand Aunt Julia singing 'Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay' is one of them.\r\n\r\nShe got straight to the point within five minutes of our meeting.\r\n\r\n'What is this about Gussie? Why did you cable for me, Bertie?'\r\n\r\n'It's rather a long story,' I said, 'and complicated. If you don't\r\nmind, I'll let you have it in a series of motion pictures. Suppose we\r\nlook in at the Auditorium for a few minutes.'\r\n\r\nThe girl, Ray, had been re-engaged for a second week at the Auditorium,\r\nowing to the big success of her first week. Her act consisted of three\r\nsongs. She did herself well in the matter of costume and scenery. She\r\nhad a ripping voice. She looked most awfully pretty; and altogether the\r\nact was, broadly speaking, a pippin.\r\n\r\nAunt Julia didn't speak till we were in our seats. Then she gave a sort\r\nof sigh.\r\n\r\n'It's twenty-five years since I was in a music-hall!'\r\n\r\nShe didn't say any more, but sat there with her eyes glued on the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nAfter about half an hour the johnnies who work the card-index system at\r\nthe side of the stage put up the name of Ray Denison, and there was a\r\ngood deal of applause.\r\n\r\n'Watch this act, Aunt Julia,' I said.\r\n\r\nShe didn't seem to hear me.\r\n\r\n'Twenty-five years! What did you say, Bertie?'\r\n\r\n'Watch this act and tell me what you think of it.'\r\n\r\n'Who is it? Ray. Oh!'\r\n\r\n'Exhibit A,' I said. 'The girl Gussie's engaged to.'\r\n\r\nThe girl did her act, and the house rose at her. They didn't want to\r\nlet her go. She had to come back again and again. When she had finally\r\ndisappeared I turned to Aunt Julia.\r\n\r\n'Well?' I said.\r\n\r\n'I like her work. She's an artist.'\r\n\r\n'We will now, if you don't mind, step a goodish way uptown.'\r\n\r\nAnd we took the subway to where Gussie, the human film, was earning his\r\nthirty-five per. As luck would have it, we hadn't been in the place ten\r\nminutes when out he came.\r\n\r\n'Exhibit B,' I said. 'Gussie.'\r\n\r\nI don't quite know what I had expected her to do, but I certainly\r\ndidn't expect her to sit there without a word. She did not move a\r\nmuscle, but just stared at Gussie as he drooled on about the moon. I\r\nwas sorry for the woman, for it must have been a shock to her to see\r\nher only son in a mauve frockcoat and a brown top-hat, but I thought it\r\nbest to let her get a strangle-hold on the intricacies of the situation\r\nas quickly as possible. If I had tried to explain the affair without\r\nthe aid of illustrations I should have talked all day and left her\r\nmuddled up as to who was going to marry whom, and why.\r\n\r\nI was astonished at the improvement in dear old Gussie. He had got back\r\nhis voice and was putting the stuff over well. It reminded me of the\r\nnight at Oxford when, then but a lad of eighteen, he sang 'Let's All Go\r\nDown the Strand' after a bump supper, standing the while up to his\r\nknees in the college fountain. He was putting just the same zip into\r\nthe thing now.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone off Aunt Julia sat perfectly still for a long time,\r\nand then she turned to me. Her eyes shone queerly.\r\n\r\n'What does this mean, Bertie?'\r\n\r\nShe spoke quite quietly, but her voice shook a bit.\r\n\r\n'Gussie went into the business,' I said, 'because the girl's father\r\nwouldn't let him marry her unless he did. If you feel up to it perhaps\r\nyou wouldn't mind tottering round to One Hundred and Thirty-third\r\nStreet and having a chat with him. He's an old boy with eyebrows, and\r\nhe's Exhibit C on my list. When I've put you in touch with him I rather\r\nfancy my share of the business is concluded, and it's up to you.'\r\n\r\nThe Danbys lived in one of those big apartments uptown which look as if\r\nthey cost the earth and really cost about half as much as a hall-room\r\ndown in the forties. We were shown into the sitting-room, and presently\r\nold Danby came in.\r\n\r\n'Good afternoon, Mr Danby,' I began.\r\n\r\nI had got as far as that when there was a kind of gasping cry at my\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n'Joe!' cried Aunt Julia, and staggered against the sofa.\r\n\r\nFor a moment old Danby stared at her, and then his mouth fell open and\r\nhis eyebrows shot up like rockets.\r\n\r\n'Julie!'\r\n\r\nAnd then they had got hold of each other's hands and were shaking them\r\ntill I wondered their arms didn't come unscrewed.\r\n\r\nI'm not equal to this sort of thing at such short notice. The\r\nchange in Aunt Julia made me feel quite dizzy. She had shed her\r\n_grande-dame_ manner completely, and was blushing and smiling. I\r\ndon't like to say such things of any aunt of mine, or I would go\r\nfurther and put it on record that she was giggling. And old Danby, who\r\nusually looked like a cross between a Roman emperor and Napoleon\r\nBonaparte in a bad temper, was behaving like a small boy.\r\n\r\n'Joe!'\r\n\r\n'Julie!'\r\n\r\n'Dear old Joe! Fancy meeting you again!'\r\n\r\n'Wherever have you come from, Julie?'\r\n\r\nWell, I didn't know what it was all about, but I felt a bit out of it.\r\nI butted in:\r\n\r\n'Aunt Julia wants to have a talk with you, Mr Danby.'\r\n\r\n'I knew you in a second, Joe!'\r\n\r\n'It's twenty-five years since I saw you, kid, and you don't look a day\r\nolder.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Joe! I'm an old woman!'\r\n\r\n'What are you doing over here? I suppose'--old Danby's cheerfulness\r\nwaned a trifle--'I suppose your husband is with you?'\r\n\r\n'My husband died a long, long while ago, Joe.'\r\n\r\nOld Danby shook his head.\r\n\r\n'You never ought to have married out of the profession, Julie. I'm\r\nnot saying a word against the late--I can't remember his name; never\r\ncould--but you shouldn't have done it, an artist like you. Shall I ever\r\nforget the way you used to knock them with \"Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay\"?'\r\n\r\n'Ah! how wonderful you were in that act, Joe.' Aunt Julia sighed. 'Do\r\nyou remember the back-fall you used to do down the steps? I always have\r\nsaid that you did the best back-fall in the profession.'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't do it now!'\r\n\r\n'Do you remember how we put it across at the Canterbury, Joe? Think of\r\nit! The Canterbury's a moving-picture house now, and the old Mogul runs\r\nFrench revues.'\r\n\r\n'I'm glad I'm not there to see them.'\r\n\r\n'Joe, tell me, why did you leave England?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I--I wanted a change. No I'll tell you the truth, kid. I wanted\r\nyou, Julie. You went off and married that--whatever that stage-door\r\njohnny's name was--and it broke me all up.'\r\n\r\nAunt Julia was staring at him. She is what they call a well-preserved\r\nwoman. It's easy to see that, twenty-five years ago, she must have been\r\nsomething quite extraordinary to look at. Even now she's almost\r\nbeautiful. She has very large brown eyes, a mass of soft grey hair, and\r\nthe complexion of a girl of seventeen.\r\n\r\n'Joe, you aren't going to tell me you were fond of me yourself!'\r\n\r\n'Of course I was fond of you. Why did I let you have all the fat in\r\n\"Fun in a Tea-Shop\"? Why did I hang about upstage while you sang\r\n\"Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay\"? Do you remember my giving you a bag of buns\r\nwhen we were on the road at Bristol?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but--'\r\n\r\n'Do you remember my giving you the ham sandwiches at Portsmouth?'\r\n\r\n'Joe!'\r\n\r\n'Do you remember my giving you a seed-cake at Birmingham? What did you\r\nthink all that meant, if not that I loved you? Why, I was working up by\r\ndegrees to telling you straight out when you suddenly went off and\r\nmarried that cane-sucking dude. That's why I wouldn't let my daughter\r\nmarry this young chap, Wilson, unless he went into the profession.\r\nShe's an artist--'\r\n\r\n'She certainly is, Joe.'\r\n\r\n'You've seen her? Where?'\r\n\r\n'At the Auditorium just now. But, Joe, you mustn't stand in the way of\r\nher marrying the man she's in love with. He's an artist, too.'\r\n\r\n'In the small time.'\r\n\r\n'You were in the small time once, Joe. You mustn't look down on him\r\nbecause he's a beginner. I know you feel that your daughter is marrying\r\nbeneath her, but--'\r\n\r\n'How on earth do you know anything about young Wilson?\r\n\r\n'He's my son.'\r\n\r\n'Your son?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Joe. And I've just been watching him work. Oh, Joe, you can't\r\nthink how proud I was of him! He's got it in him. It's fate. He's my\r\nson and he's in the profession! Joe, you don't know what I've been\r\nthrough for his sake. They made a lady of me. I never worked so hard in\r\nmy life as I did to become a real lady. They kept telling me I had got\r\nto put it across, no matter what it cost, so that he wouldn't be\r\nashamed of me. The study was something terrible. I had to watch myself\r\nevery minute for years, and I never knew when I might fluff my lines or\r\nfall down on some bit of business. But I did it, because I didn't want\r\nhim to be ashamed of me, though all the time I was just aching to be\r\nback where I belonged.'\r\n\r\nOld Danby made a jump at her, and took her by the shoulders.\r\n\r\n'Come back where you belong, Julie!' he cried. 'Your husband's dead,\r\nyour son's a pro. Come back! It's twenty-five years ago, but I haven't\r\nchanged. I want you still. I've always wanted you. You've got to come\r\nback, kid, where you belong.'\r\n\r\nAunt Julia gave a sort of gulp and looked at him.\r\n\r\n'Joe!' she said in a kind of whisper.\r\n\r\n'You're here, kid,' said Old Danby, huskily. 'You've come back....\r\nTwenty-five years!... You've come back and you're going to stay!'\r\n\r\nShe pitched forward into his arms, and he caught her.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Joe! Joe! Joe!' she said. 'Hold me. Don't let me go. Take care of\r\nme.'\r\n\r\nAnd I edged for the door and slipped from the room. I felt weak. The\r\nold bean will stand a certain amount, but this was too much. I groped\r\nmy way out into the street and wailed for a taxi.\r\n\r\nGussie called on me at the hotel that night. He curveted into the room\r\nas if he had bought it and the rest of the city.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he said, 'I feel as if I were dreaming.'\r\n\r\n'I wish I could feel like that, old top,' I said, and I took another\r\nglance at a cable that had arrived half an hour ago from Aunt Agatha. I\r\nhad been looking at it at intervals ever since.\r\n\r\n'Ray and I got back to her flat this evening. Who do you think was\r\nthere? The mater! She was sitting hand in hand with old Danby.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'He was sitting hand in hand with her.'\r\n\r\n'Really?'\r\n\r\n'They are going to be married.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly.'\r\n\r\n'Ray and I are going to be married.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose so.'\r\n\r\n'Bertie, old man, I feel immense. I look round me, and everything seems\r\nto be absolutely corking. The change in the mater is marvellous. She is\r\ntwenty-five years younger. She and old Danby are talking of reviving\r\n\"Fun in a Tea-Shop\", and going out on the road with it.'\r\n\r\nI got up.\r\n\r\n'Gussie, old top,' I said, 'leave me for a while. I would be alone. I\r\nthink I've got brain fever or something.'\r\n\r\n'Sorry, old man; perhaps New York doesn't agree with you. When do you\r\nexpect to go back to England?'\r\n\r\nI looked again at Aunt Agatha's cable.\r\n\r\n'With luck,' I said, 'in about ten years.'\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone I took up the cable and read it again.\r\n\r\n'What is happening?' it read. 'Shall I come over?'\r\n\r\nI sucked a pencil for a while, and then I wrote the reply.\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy cable to word, but I managed it.\r\n\r\n'No,' I wrote, 'stay where you are. Profession overcrowded.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILTON'S HOLIDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jack Wilton first came to Marois Bay, none of us dreamed that he\r\nwas a man with a hidden sorrow in his life. There was something about\r\nthe man which made the idea absurd, or would have made it absurd if he\r\nhimself had not been the authority for the story. He looked so\r\nthoroughly pleased with life and with himself. He was one of those men\r\nwhom you instinctively label in your mind as 'strong'. He was so\r\nhealthy, so fit, and had such a confident, yet sympathetic, look about\r\nhim that you felt directly you saw him that here was the one person you\r\nwould have selected as the recipient of that hard-luck story of yours.\r\nYou felt that his kindly strength would have been something to lean on.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it was by trying to lean on it that Spencer Clay\r\ngot hold of the facts of the case; and when young Clay got hold of\r\nanything, Marois Bay at large had it hot and fresh a few hours later;\r\nfor Spencer was one of those slack-jawed youths who are\r\nconstitutionally incapable of preserving a secret.\r\n\r\nWithin two hours, then, of Clay's chat with Wilton, everyone in the\r\nplace knew that, jolly and hearty as the new-comer might seem, there\r\nwas that gnawing at his heart which made his outward cheeriness simply\r\nheroic.\r\n\r\nClay, it seems, who is the worst specimen of self-pitier, had gone to\r\nWilton, in whom, as a new-comer, he naturally saw a fine fresh\r\nrepository for his tales of woe, and had opened with a long yarn of\r\nsome misfortune or other. I forget which it was; it might have been any\r\none of a dozen or so which he had constantly in stock, and it is\r\nimmaterial which it was. The point is that, having heard him out very\r\npolitely and patiently, Wilton came back at him with a story which\r\nsilenced even Clay. Spencer was equal to most things, but even he could\r\nnot go on whining about how he had foozled his putting and been snubbed\r\nat the bridge-table, or whatever it was that he was pitying himself\r\nabout just then, when a man was telling him the story of a wrecked\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n'He told me not to let it go any further,' said Clay to everyone he\r\nmet, 'but of course it doesn't matter telling you. It is a thing he\r\ndoesn't like to have known. He told me because he said there was\r\nsomething about me that seemed to extract confidences--a kind of\r\nstrength, he said. You wouldn't think it to look at him, but his life\r\nis an absolute blank. Absolutely ruined, don't you know. He told me the\r\nwhole thing so simply and frankly that it broke me all up. It seems\r\nthat he was engaged to be married a few years ago, and on the wedding\r\nmorning--absolutely on the wedding morning--the girl was taken suddenly\r\nill, and--'\r\n\r\n'And died?'\r\n\r\n'And died. Died in his arms. Absolutely in his arms, old top.'\r\n\r\n'What a terrible thing!'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely. He's never got over it. You won't let it go any further,\r\nwill you old man?'\r\n\r\nAnd off sped Spencer, to tell the tale to someone else.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEveryone was terribly sorry for Wilton. He was such a good fellow, such\r\na sportsman, and, above all, so young, that one hated the thought that,\r\nlaugh as he might, beneath his laughter there lay the pain of that\r\nawful memory. He seemed so happy, too. It was only in moments of\r\nconfidence, in those heart-to-heart talks when men reveal their deeper\r\nfeelings, that he ever gave a hint that all was not well with him. As,\r\nfor example, when Ellerton, who is always in love with someone, backed\r\nhim into a corner one evening and began to tell him the story of his\r\nlatest affair, he had hardly begun when such a look of pain came over\r\nWilton's face that he ceased instantly. He said afterwards that the\r\nsudden realization of the horrible break he was making hit him like a\r\nbullet, and the manner in which he turned the conversation practically\r\nwithout pausing from love to a discussion of the best method of getting\r\nout of the bunker at the seventh hole was, in the circumstances, a\r\ntriumph of tact.\r\n\r\nMarois Bay is a quiet place even in the summer, and the Wilton tragedy\r\nwas naturally the subject of much talk. It is a sobering thing to get a\r\nglimpse of the underlying sadness of life like that, and there was a\r\ndisposition at first on the part of the community to behave in his\r\npresence in a manner reminiscent of pall-bearers at a funeral. But\r\nthings soon adjusted themselves. He was outwardly so cheerful that it\r\nseemed ridiculous for the rest of us to step softly and speak with\r\nhushed voices. After all, when you came to examine it, the thing was\r\nhis affair, and it was for him to dictate the lines on which it should\r\nbe treated. If he elected to hide his pain under a bright smile and a\r\nlaugh like that of a hyena with a more than usually keen sense of\r\nhumour, our line was obviously to follow his lead.\r\n\r\nWe did so; and by degrees the fact that his life was permanently\r\nblighted became almost a legend. At the back of our minds we were aware\r\nof it, but it did not obtrude itself into the affairs of every day. It\r\nwas only when someone, forgetting, as Ellerton had done, tried to\r\nenlist his sympathy for some misfortune of his own that the look of\r\npain in his eyes and the sudden tightening of his lips reminded us that\r\nhe still remembered.\r\n\r\nMatters had been at this stage for perhaps two weeks when Mary Campbell\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nSex attraction is so purely a question of the taste of the individual\r\nthat the wise man never argues about it. He accepts its vagaries as\r\npart of the human mystery, and leaves it at that. To me there was no\r\ncharm whatever about Mary Campbell. It may have been that, at the\r\nmoment, I was in love with Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, and Clarice\r\nWembley--for at Marois Bay, in the summer, a man who is worth his salt\r\nis more than equal to three love affairs simultaneously--but anyway,\r\nshe left me cold. Not one thrill could she awake in me. She was small\r\nand, to my mind, insignificant. Some men said that she had fine eyes.\r\nThey seemed to me just ordinary eyes. And her hair was just ordinary\r\nhair. In fact, ordinary was the word that described her.\r\n\r\nBut from the first it was plain that she seemed wonderful with Wilton,\r\nwhich was all the more remarkable, seeing that he was the one man of us\r\nall who could have got any girl in Marois Bay that he wanted. When a\r\nman is six foot high, is a combination of Hercules and Apollo, and\r\nplays tennis, golf, and the banjo with almost superhuman vim, his path\r\nwith the girls of a summer seaside resort is pretty smooth. But, when\r\nyou add to all these things a tragedy like Wilton's, he can only be\r\ndescribed as having a walk-over.\r\n\r\nGirls love a tragedy. At least, most girls do. It makes a man\r\ninteresting to them. Grace Bates was always going on about how\r\ninteresting Wilton was. So was Heloise Miller. So was Clarice Wembley.\r\nBut it was not until Mary Campbell came that he displayed any real\r\nenthusiasm at all for the feminine element of Marois Bay. We put it\r\ndown to the fact that he could not forget, but the real reason, I now\r\nknow, was that he considered that girls were a nuisance on the links\r\nand in the tennis-court. I suppose a plus two golfer and a Wildingesque\r\ntennis-player, such as Wilton was, does feel like that. Personally, I\r\nthink that girls add to the fun of the thing. But then, my handicap is\r\ntwelve, and, though I have been playing tennis for many years, I doubt\r\nif I have got my first serve--the fast one--over the net more than half\r\na dozen times.\r\n\r\nBut Mary Campbell overcame Wilton's prejudices in twenty-four hours. He\r\nseemed to feel lonely on the links without her, and he positively egged\r\nher to be his partner in the doubles. What Mary thought of him we did\r\nnot know. She was one of those inscrutable girls.\r\n\r\nAnd so things went on. If it had not been that I knew Wilton's story, I\r\nshould have classed the thing as one of those summer love-affairs to\r\nwhich the Marois Bay air is so peculiarly conducive. The only reason\r\nwhy anyone comes away from a summer at Marois Bay unbetrothed is\r\nbecause there are so many girls that he falls in love with that his\r\nholiday is up before he can, so to speak, concentrate.\r\n\r\nBut in Wilton's case this was out of the question. A man does not get\r\nover the sort of blow he had had, not, at any rate, for many years: and\r\nwe had gathered that his tragedy was comparatively recent.\r\n\r\nI doubt if I was ever more astonished in my life than the night when he\r\nconfided in me. Why he should have chosen me as a confidant I cannot\r\nsay. I am inclined to think that I happened to be alone with him at the\r\npsychological moment when a man must confide in somebody or burst; and\r\nWilton chose the lesser evil.\r\n\r\nI was strolling along the shore after dinner, smoking a cigar and\r\nthinking of Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I\r\nhappened upon him. It was a beautiful night, and we sat down and drank\r\nit in for a while. The first intimation I had that all was not well\r\nwith him was when he suddenly emitted a hollow groan.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he had begun to confide.\r\n\r\n'I'm in the deuce of a hole,' he said. 'What would you do in my\r\nposition?'\r\n\r\n'Yes?' I said.\r\n\r\n'I proposed to Mary Campbell this evening.'\r\n\r\n'Congratulations.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks. She refused me.'\r\n\r\n'Refused you!'\r\n\r\n'Yes--because of Amy.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the narrative required footnotes.\r\n\r\n'Who is Amy?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Amy is the girl--'\r\n\r\n'Which girl?'\r\n\r\n'The girl who died, you know. Mary had got hold of the whole story. In\r\nfact, it was the tremendous sympathy she showed that encouraged me to\r\npropose. If it hadn't been for that, I shouldn't have had the nerve.\r\nI'm not fit to black her shoes.'\r\n\r\nOdd, the poor opinion a man always has--when he is in love--of his\r\npersonal attractions. There were times when I thought of Grace Bates,\r\nHeloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I felt like one of the beasts\r\nthat perish. But then, I'm nothing to write home about, whereas the\r\nsmallest gleam of intelligence should have told Wilton that he was a\r\nkind of Ouida guardsman.\r\n\r\n'This evening I managed somehow to do it. She was tremendously nice\r\nabout it--said she was very fond of me and all that--but it was quite\r\nout of the question because of Amy.'\r\n\r\n'I don't follow this. What did she mean?'\r\n\r\n'It's perfectly clear, if you bear in mind that Mary is the most\r\nsensitive, spiritual, highly strung girl that ever drew breath,' said\r\nWilton, a little coldly. 'Her position is this: she feels that, because\r\nof Amy, she can never have my love completely; between us there would\r\nalways be Amy's memory. It would be the same as if she married a\r\nwidower.'\r\n\r\n'Well, widowers marry.'\r\n\r\n'They don't marry girls like Mary.'\r\n\r\nI couldn't help feeling that this was a bit of luck for the widowers;\r\nbut I didn't say so. One has always got to remember that opinions\r\ndiffer about girls. One man's peach, so to speak, is another man's\r\npoison. I have met men who didn't like Grace Bates, men who, if Heloise\r\nMiller or Clarice Wembley had given them their photographs, would have\r\nused them to cut the pages of a novel.\r\n\r\n'Amy stands between us,' said Wilton.\r\n\r\nI breathed a sympathetic snort. I couldn't think of anything noticeably\r\nsuitable to say.\r\n\r\n'Stands between us,' repeated Wilton. 'And the damn silly part of the\r\nwhole thing is that there isn't any Amy. I invented her.'\r\n\r\n'You--what!'\r\n\r\n'Invented her. Made her up. No, I'm not mad. I had a reason. Let me\r\nsee, you come from London, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Then you haven't any friends. It's different with me. I live in a\r\nsmall country town, and everyone's my friend. I don't know what it is\r\nabout me, but for some reason, ever since I can remember, I've been\r\nlooked on as the strong man of my town, the man who's _all right_.\r\nAm I making myself clear?'\r\n\r\n'Not quite.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what I am trying to get at is this. Either because I'm a strong\r\nsort of fellow to look at, and have obviously never been sick in my\r\nlife, or because I can't help looking pretty cheerful, the whole of\r\nBridley-in-the-Wold seems to take it for granted that I can't possibly\r\nhave any troubles of my own, and that I am consequently fair game for\r\nanyone who has any sort of worry. I have the sympathetic manner, and\r\nthey come to me to be cheered up. If a fellow's in love, he makes a\r\nbee-line for me, and tells me all about it. If anyone has had a\r\nbereavement, I am the rock on which he leans for support. Well, I'm a\r\npatient sort of man, and, as far as Bridley-in-the-Wold is concerned, I\r\nam willing to play the part. But a strong man does need an occasional\r\nholiday, and I made up my mind that I would get it. Directly I got here\r\nI saw that the same old game was going to start. Spencer Clay swooped\r\ndown on me at once. I'm as big a draw with the Spencer Clay type of\r\nmaudlin idiot as catnip is with a cat. Well, I could stand it at home,\r\nbut I was hanged if I was going to have my holiday spoiled. So I\r\ninvented Amy. Now do you see?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly I see. And I perceive something else which you appear to\r\nhave overlooked. If Amy doesn't exist--or, rather, never did exist--she\r\ncannot stand between you and Miss Campbell. Tell her what you have told\r\nme, and all will be well.'\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n'You don't know Mary. She would never forgive me. You don't know what\r\nsympathy, what angelic sympathy, she has poured out on me about Amy. I\r\ncan't possibly tell her the whole thing was a fraud. It would make her\r\nfeel so foolish.'\r\n\r\n'You must risk it. At the worst, you lose nothing.'\r\n\r\nHe brightened a little.\r\n\r\n'No, that's true,' he said. 'I've half a mind to do it.'\r\n\r\n'Make it a whole mind,' I said, 'and you win out.'\r\n\r\nI was wrong. Sometimes I am. The trouble was, apparently, that I didn't\r\nknow Mary. I am sure Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, or Clarice Wembley\r\nwould not have acted as she did. They might have been a trifle stunned\r\nat first, but they would soon have come round, and all would have been\r\njoy. But with Mary, no. What took place at the interview I do not know;\r\nbut it was swiftly perceived by Marois Bay that the Wilton-Campbell\r\nalliance was off. They no longer walked together, golfed together, and\r\nplayed tennis on the same side of the net. They did not even speak to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story I can speak of only from hearsay. How it became\r\npublic property, I do not know. But there was a confiding strain in\r\nWilton, and I imagine he confided in someone, who confided in someone\r\nelse. At any rate, it is recorded in Marois Bay's unwritten archives,\r\nfrom which I now extract it.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nFor some days after the breaking-off of diplomatic relations, Wilton\r\nseemed too pulverized to resume the offensive. He mooned about the\r\nlinks by himself, playing a shocking game, and generally comported\r\nhimself like a man who has looked for the escape of gas with a lighted\r\ncandle. In affairs of love the strongest men generally behave with the\r\nmost spineless lack of resolution. Wilton weighed thirteen stone, and\r\nhis muscles were like steel cables; but he could not have shown less\r\npluck in this crisis in his life if he had been a poached egg. It was\r\npitiful to see him.\r\n\r\nMary, in these days, simply couldn't see that he was on the earth. She\r\nlooked round him, above him, and through him, but never at him; which\r\nwas rotten from Wilton's point of view, for he had developed a sort of\r\nwistful expression--I am convinced that he practised it before the\r\nmirror after his bath--which should have worked wonders, if only he\r\ncould have got action with it. But she avoided his eye as if he had\r\nbeen a creditor whom she was trying to slide past on the street.\r\n\r\nShe irritated me. To let the breach widen in this way was absurd.\r\nWilton, when I said as much to him, said that it was due to her\r\nwonderful sensitiveness and highly strungness, and that it was just one\r\nmore proof to him of the loftiness of her soul and her shrinking horror\r\nof any form of deceit. In fact, he gave me the impression that, though\r\nthe affair was rending his vitals, he took a mournful pleasure in\r\ncontemplating her perfection.\r\n\r\nNow one afternoon Wilton took his misery for a long walk along the\r\nseashore. He tramped over the sand for some considerable time, and\r\nfinally pulled up in a little cove, backed by high cliffs and dotted\r\nwith rocks. The shore around Marois Bay is full of them.\r\n\r\nBy this time the afternoon sun had begun to be too warm for comfort,\r\nand it struck Wilton that he could be a great deal more comfortable\r\nnursing his wounded heart with his back against one of the rocks than\r\ntramping any farther over the sand. Most of the Marois Bay scenery is\r\nsimply made as a setting for the nursing of a wounded heart. The cliffs\r\nare a sombre indigo, sinister and forbidding; and even on the finest\r\ndays the sea has a curious sullen look. You have only to get away from\r\nthe crowd near the bathing-machines and reach one of these small coves\r\nand get your book against a rock and your pipe well alight, and you can\r\nsimply wallow in misery. I have done it myself. The day when Heloise\r\nMiller went golfing with Teddy Bingley I spent the whole afternoon in\r\none of these retreats. It is true that, after twenty minutes of\r\ncontemplating the breakers, I fell asleep; but that is bound to happen.\r\n\r\nIt happened to Wilton. For perhaps half an hour he brooded, and then\r\nhis pipe fell from his mouth and he dropped off into a peaceful\r\nslumber. And time went by.\r\n\r\nIt was a touch of cramp that finally woke him. He jumped up with a\r\nyell, and stood there massaging his calf. And he had hardly got rid of\r\nthe pain, when a startled exclamation broke the primeval stillness; and\r\nthere, on the other side of the rock, was Mary Campbell.\r\n\r\nNow, if Wilton had had any inductive reasoning in his composition at\r\nall, he would have been tremendously elated. A girl does not creep out\r\nto a distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy; and if Mary\r\nCampbell was unhappy she must be unhappy about him; and if she was\r\nunhappy about him all he had to do was to show a bit of determination\r\nand get the whole thing straightened out. But Wilton, whom grief had\r\nreduced to the mental level of an oyster, did not reason this out; and\r\nthe sight of her deprived him of practically all his faculties,\r\nincluding speech. He just stood there and yammered.\r\n\r\n'Did you follow me here, Mr Wilton?' said Mary, very coldly.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. Eventually he managed to say that he had come there\r\nby chance, and had fallen asleep under the rock. As this was exactly\r\nwhat Mary had done, she could not reasonably complain. So that\r\nconcluded the conversation for the time being. She walked away in the\r\ndirection of Marois Bay without another word, and presently he lost\r\nsight of her round a bend in the cliffs.\r\n\r\nHis position now was exceedingly unpleasant. If she had such a distaste\r\nfor his presence, common decency made it imperative that he should give\r\nher a good start on the homeward journey. He could not tramp along a\r\ncouple of yards in the rear all the way. So he had to remain where he\r\nwas till she had got well off the mark. And as he was wearing a thin\r\nflannel suit, and the sun had gone in, and a chilly breeze had sprung\r\nup, his mental troubles were practically swamped in physical\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nJust as he had decided that he could now make a move, he was surprised\r\nto see her coming back.\r\n\r\nWilton really was elated at this. The construction he put on it was\r\nthat she had relented and was coming back to fling her arms round his\r\nneck. He was just bracing himself for the clash, when he caught her\r\neye, and it was as cold and unfriendly as the sea.\r\n\r\n'I must go round the other way,' she said. 'The water has come up too\r\nfar on that side.'\r\n\r\nAnd she walked past him to the other end of the cove.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of another wait chilled Wilton to the marrow. The wind had\r\nnow grown simply freezing, and it came through his thin suit and roamed\r\nabout all over him in a manner that caused him exquisite discomfort. He\r\nbegan to jump to keep himself warm.\r\n\r\nHe was leaping heavenwards for the hundredth time, when, chancing to\r\nglance to one side, he perceived Mary again returning. By this time his\r\nphysical misery had so completely overcome the softer emotions in his\r\nbosom that his only feeling now was one of thorough irritation. It was\r\nnot fair, he felt, that she should jockey at the start in this way and\r\nkeep him hanging about here catching cold. He looked at her, when she\r\ncame within range, quite balefully.\r\n\r\n'It is impossible,' she said, 'to get round that way either.'\r\n\r\nOne grows so accustomed in this world to everything going smoothly,\r\nthat the idea of actual danger had not yet come home to her. From where\r\nshe stood in the middle of the cove, the sea looked so distant that the\r\nfact that it had closed the only ways of getting out was at the moment\r\nmerely annoying. She felt much the same as she would have felt if she\r\nhad arrived at a station to catch a train and had been told that the\r\ntrain was not running.\r\n\r\nShe therefore seated herself on a rock, and contemplated the ocean.\r\nWilton walked up and down. Neither showed any disposition to exercise\r\nthat gift of speech which places Man in a class of his own, above the\r\nox, the ass, the common wart-hog, and the rest of the lower animals. It\r\nwas only when a wave swished over the base of her rock that Mary broke\r\nthe silence.\r\n\r\n'The tide is coming _in_' she faltered.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the sea with such altered feelings that it seemed a\r\ndifferent sea altogether.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of it to look at. It filled the entire mouth of the\r\nlittle bay, swirling up the sand and lashing among the rocks in a\r\nfashion which made one thought stand out above all the others in her\r\nmind--the recollection that she could not swim.\r\n\r\n'Mr Wilton!'\r\n\r\nWilton bowed coldly.\r\n\r\n'Mr Wilton, the tide. It's coming IN.'\r\n\r\nWilton glanced superciliously at the sea.\r\n\r\n'So,' he said, 'I perceive.'\r\n\r\n'But what shall we do?'\r\n\r\nWilton shrugged his shoulders. He was feeling at war with Nature and\r\nHumanity combined. The wind had shifted a few points to the east, and\r\nwas exploring his anatomy with the skill of a qualified surgeon.\r\n\r\n'We shall drown,' cried Miss Campbell. 'We shall drown. We shall drown.\r\nWe shall drown.'\r\n\r\nAll Wilton's resentment left him. Until he heard that pitiful wail his\r\nonly thoughts had been for himself.\r\n\r\n'Mary!' he said, with a wealth of tenderness in his voice.\r\n\r\nShe came to him as a little child comes to its mother, and he put his\r\narm around her.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Jack!'\r\n\r\n'My darling!'\r\n\r\n'I'm frightened!'\r\n\r\n'My precious!'\r\n\r\nIt is in moments of peril, when the chill breath of fear blows upon our\r\nsouls, clearing them of pettiness, that we find ourselves.\r\n\r\nShe looked about her wildly.\r\n\r\n'Could we climb the cliffs?'\r\n\r\n'I doubt it.'\r\n\r\n'If we called for help--'\r\n\r\n'We could do that.'\r\n\r\nThey raised their voices, but the only answer was the crashing of the\r\nwaves and the cry of the sea-birds. The water was swirling at their\r\nfeet, and they drew back to the shelter of the cliffs. There they stood\r\nin silence, watching.\r\n\r\n'Mary,' said Wilton in a low voice, 'tell me one thing.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Jack?'\r\n\r\n'Have you forgiven me?'\r\n\r\n'Forgiven you! How can you ask at a moment like this? I love you with\r\nall my heart and soul.'\r\n\r\nHe kissed her, and a strange look of peace came over his face.\r\n\r\n'I am happy.'\r\n\r\n'I, too.'\r\n\r\nA fleck of foam touched her face, and she shivered.\r\n\r\n'It was worth it,' he said quietly. 'If all misunderstandings are\r\ncleared away and nothing can come between us again, it is a small price\r\nto pay--unpleasant as it will be when it comes.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps--perhaps it will not be very unpleasant. They say that\r\ndrowning is an easy death.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't mean drowning, dearest. I meant a cold in the head.'\r\n\r\n'A cold in the head!'\r\n\r\nHe nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n'I don't see how it can be avoided. You know how chilly it gets these\r\nlate summer nights. It will be a long time before we can get away.'\r\n\r\nShe laughed a shrill, unnatural laugh.\r\n\r\n'You are talking like this to keep my courage up. You know in your\r\nheart that there is no hope for us. Nothing can save us now. The water\r\nwill come creeping--creeping--'\r\n\r\n'Let it creep! It can't get past that rock there.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'It can't. The tide doesn't come up any farther. I know, because I was\r\ncaught here last week.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment she looked at him without speaking. Then she uttered a cry\r\nin which relief, surprise, and indignation were so nicely blended that\r\nit would have been impossible to say which predominated.\r\n\r\nHe was eyeing the approaching waters with an indulgent smile.\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you tell me?' she cried.\r\n\r\n'I did tell you.'\r\n\r\n'You know what I mean. Why did you let me go on thinking we were in\r\ndanger, when--'\r\n\r\n'We _were_ in danger. We shall probably get pneumonia.'\r\n\r\n'Isch!'\r\n\r\n'There! You're sneezing already.'\r\n\r\n'I am not sneezing. That was an exclamation of disgust.'\r\n\r\n'It sounded like a sneeze. It must have been, for you've every reason\r\nto sneeze, but why you should utter exclamations of disgust I cannot\r\nimagine.'\r\n\r\n'I'm disgusted with you--with your meanness. You deliberately tricked\r\nme into saying--'\r\n\r\n'Saying--'\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n'What you said was that you loved me with all your heart and soul. You\r\ncan't get away from that, and it's good enough for me.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's not true any longer.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is,' said Wilton, comfortably; 'bless it.'\r\n\r\n'It is not. I'm going right away now, and I shall never speak to you\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\nShe moved away from him, and prepared to sit down.\r\n\r\n'There's a jelly-fish just where you're going to sit,' said Wilton.\r\n\r\n'I don't care.'\r\n\r\n'It will. I speak from experience, as one on whom you have sat so\r\noften.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not amused.'\r\n\r\n'Have patience. I can be funnier than that.'\r\n\r\n'Please don't talk to me.'\r\n\r\n'Very well.'\r\n\r\nShe seated herself with her back to him. Dignity demanded reprisals, so\r\nhe seated himself with his back to her; and the futile ocean raged\r\ntowards them, and the wind grew chillier every minute.\r\n\r\nTime passed. Darkness fell. The little bay became a black cavern,\r\ndotted here and there with white, where the breeze whipped the surface\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nWilton sighed. It was lonely sitting there all by himself. How much\r\njollier it would have been if--\r\n\r\nA hand touched his shoulder, and a voice spoke--meekly.\r\n\r\n'Jack, dear, it--it's awfully cold. Don't you think if we were\r\nto--snuggle up--'\r\n\r\nHe reached out and folded her in an embrace which would have aroused\r\nthe professional enthusiasm of Hackenschmidt and drawn guttural\r\ncongratulations from Zbysco. She creaked, but did not crack, beneath\r\nthe strain.\r\n\r\n'That's much nicer,' she said, softly. 'Jack, I don't think the tide's\r\nstarted even to think of going down yet.'\r\n\r\n'I hope not,' said Wilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIXER\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _He Meets a Shy Gentleman_\r\n\r\nLooking back, I always consider that my career as a dog proper really\r\nstarted when I was bought for the sum of half a crown by the Shy Man.\r\nThat event marked the end of my puppyhood. The knowledge that I was\r\nworth actual cash to somebody filled me with a sense of new\r\nresponsibilities. It sobered me. Besides, it was only after that\r\nhalf-crown changed hands that I went out into the great world; and,\r\nhowever interesting life may be in an East End public-house, it is only\r\nwhen you go out into the world that you really broaden your mind and\r\nbegin to see things.\r\n\r\nWithin its limitations, my life had been singularly full and vivid. I\r\nwas born, as I say, in a public-house in the East End, and, however\r\nlacking a public-house may be in refinement and the true culture, it\r\ncertainly provides plenty of excitement. Before I was six weeks old I\r\nhad upset three policemen by getting between their legs when they came\r\nround to the side-door, thinking they had heard suspicious noises; and\r\nI can still recall the interesting sensation of being chased seventeen\r\ntimes round the yard with a broom-handle after a well-planned and\r\ncompletely successful raid on the larder. These and other happenings of\r\na like nature soothed for the moment but could not cure the\r\nrestlessness which has always been so marked a trait in my character. I\r\nhave always been restless, unable to settle down in one place and\r\nanxious to get on to the next thing. This may be due to a gipsy strain\r\nin my ancestry--one of my uncles travelled with a circus--or it may be\r\nthe Artistic Temperament, acquired from a grandfather who, before dying\r\nof a surfeit of paste in the property-room of the Bristol Coliseum,\r\nwhich he was visiting in the course of a professional tour, had an\r\nestablished reputation on the music-hall stage as one of Professor\r\nPond's Performing Poodles.\r\n\r\nI owe the fullness and variety of my life to this restlessness of mine,\r\nfor I have repeatedly left comfortable homes in order to follow some\r\nperfect stranger who looked as if he were on his way to somewhere\r\ninteresting. Sometimes I think I must have cat blood in me.\r\n\r\nThe Shy Man came into our yard one afternoon in April, while I was\r\nsleeping with mother in the sun on an old sweater which we had borrowed\r\nfrom Fred, one of the barmen. I heard mother growl, but I didn't take\r\nany notice. Mother is what they call a good watch-dog, and she growls\r\nat everybody except master. At first, when she used to do it, I would\r\nget up and bark my head off, but not now. Life's too short to bark at\r\neverybody who comes into our yard. It is behind the public-house, and\r\nthey keep empty bottles and things there, so people are always coming\r\nand going.\r\n\r\nBesides, I was tired. I had had a very busy morning, helping the men\r\nbring in a lot of cases of beer, and running into the saloon to talk to\r\nFred and generally looking after things. So I was just dozing off\r\nagain, when I heard a voice say, 'Well, he's ugly enough!' Then I knew\r\nthat they were talking about me.\r\n\r\nI have never disguised it from myself, and nobody has ever disguised it\r\nfrom me, that I am not a handsome dog. Even mother never thought me\r\nbeautiful. She was no Gladys Cooper herself, but she never hesitated to\r\ncriticize my appearance. In fact, I have yet to meet anyone who did.\r\nThe first thing strangers say about me is, 'What an ugly dog!'\r\n\r\nI don't know what I am. I have a bulldog kind of a face, but the rest\r\nof me is terrier. I have a long tail which sticks straight up in the\r\nair. My hair is wiry. My eyes are brown. I am jet black, with a white\r\nchest. I once overheard Fred saying that I was a Gorgonzola\r\ncheese-hound, and I have generally found Fred reliable in his\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nWhen I found that I was under discussion, I opened my eyes. Master was\r\nstanding there, looking down at me, and by his side the man who had\r\njust said I was ugly enough. The man was a thin man, about the age of a\r\nbarman and smaller than a policeman. He had patched brown shoes and\r\nblack trousers.\r\n\r\n'But he's got a sweet nature,' said master.\r\n\r\nThis was true, luckily for me. Mother always said, 'A dog without\r\ninfluence or private means, if he is to make his way in the world, must\r\nhave either good looks or amiability.' But, according to her, I overdid\r\nit. 'A dog,' she used to say, 'can have a good heart, without chumming\r\nwith every Tom, Dick, and Harry he meets. Your behaviour is sometimes\r\nquite un-doglike.' Mother prided herself on being a one-man dog. She\r\nkept herself to herself, and wouldn't kiss anybody except master--not\r\neven Fred.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm a mixer. I can't help it. It's my nature. I like men. I like\r\nthe taste of their boots, the smell of their legs, and the sound of\r\ntheir voices. It may be weak of me, but a man has only to speak to me\r\nand a sort of thrill goes right down my spine and sets my tail wagging.\r\n\r\nI wagged it now. The man looked at me rather distantly. He didn't pat\r\nme. I suspected--what I afterwards found to be the case--that he was\r\nshy, so I jumped up at him to put him at his ease. Mother growled\r\nagain. I felt that she did not approve.\r\n\r\n'Why, he's took quite a fancy to you already,' said master.\r\n\r\nThe man didn't say a word. He seemed to be brooding on something. He\r\nwas one of those silent men. He reminded me of Joe, the old dog down\r\nthe street at the grocer's shop, who lies at the door all day, blinking\r\nand not speaking to anybody.\r\n\r\nMaster began to talk about me. It surprised me, the way he praised me.\r\nI hadn't a suspicion he admired me so much. From what he said you would\r\nhave thought I had won prizes and ribbons at the Crystal Palace. But\r\nthe man didn't seem to be impressed. He kept on saying nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen master had finished telling him what a wonderful dog I was till I\r\nblushed, the man spoke.\r\n\r\n'Less of it,' he said. 'Half a crown is my bid, and if he was an angel\r\nfrom on high you couldn't get another ha'penny out of me. What about\r\nit?'\r\n\r\nA thrill went down my spine and out at my tail, for of course I saw now\r\nwhat was happening. The man wanted to buy me and take me away. I looked\r\nat master hopefully.\r\n\r\n'He's more like a son to me than a dog,' said master, sort of wistful.\r\n\r\n'It's his face that makes you feel that way,' said the man,\r\nunsympathetically. 'If you had a son that's just how he would look.\r\nHalf a crown is my offer, and I'm in a hurry.'\r\n\r\n'All right,' said master, with a sigh, 'though it's giving him away, a\r\nvaluable dog like that. Where's your half-crown?'\r\n\r\nThe man got a bit of rope and tied it round my neck.\r\n\r\nI could hear mother barking advice and telling me to be a credit to the\r\nfamily, but I was too excited to listen.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, mother,' I said. 'Good-bye, master. Good-bye, Fred. Good-bye\r\neverybody. I'm off to see life. The Shy Man has bought me for half a\r\ncrown. Wow!'\r\n\r\nI kept running round in circles and shouting, till the man gave me a\r\nkick and told me to stop it.\r\n\r\nSo I did.\r\n\r\nI don't know where we went, but it was a long way. I had never been off\r\nour street before in my life and I didn't know the whole world was half\r\nas big as that. We walked on and on, and the man jerked at my rope\r\nwhenever I wanted to stop and look at anything. He wouldn't even let me\r\npass the time of the day with dogs we met.\r\n\r\nWhen we had gone about a hundred miles and were just going to turn in\r\nat a dark doorway, a policeman suddenly stopped the man. I could feel\r\nby the way the man pulled at my rope and tried to hurry on that he\r\ndidn't want to speak to the policeman. The more I saw of the man the\r\nmore I saw how shy he was.\r\n\r\n'Hi!' said the policeman, and we had to stop.\r\n\r\n'I've got a message for you, old pal,' said the policeman. 'It's from\r\nthe Board of Health. They told me to tell you you needed a change of\r\nair. See?'\r\n\r\n'All right!' said the man.\r\n\r\n'And take it as soon as you like. Else you'll find you'll get it given\r\nyou. See?'\r\n\r\nI looked at the man with a good deal of respect. He was evidently\r\nsomeone very important, if they worried so about his health.\r\n\r\n'I'm going down to the country tonight,' said the man.\r\n\r\nThe policeman seemed pleased.\r\n\r\n'That's a bit of luck for the country,' he said. 'Don't go changing\r\nyour mind.'\r\n\r\nAnd we walked on, and went in at the dark doorway, and climbed about a\r\nmillion stairs and went into a room that smelt of rats. The man sat\r\ndown and swore a little, and I sat and looked at him.\r\n\r\nPresently I couldn't keep it in any longer.\r\n\r\n'Do we live here?' I said. 'Is it true we're going to the country?\r\nWasn't that policeman a good sort? Don't you like policemen? I knew\r\nlots of policemen at the public-house. Are there any other dogs here?\r\nWhat is there for dinner? What's in that cupboard? When are you going\r\nto take me out for another run? May I go out and see if I can find a\r\ncat?'\r\n\r\n'Stop that yelping,' he said.\r\n\r\n'When we go to the country, where shall we live? Are you going to be a\r\ncaretaker at a house? Fred's father is a caretaker at a big house in\r\nKent. I've heard Fred talk about it. You didn't meet Fred when you came\r\nto the public-house, did you? You would like Fred. I like Fred. Mother\r\nlikes Fred. We all like Fred.'\r\n\r\nI was going on to tell him a lot more about Fred, who had always been\r\none of my warmest friends, when he suddenly got hold of a stick and\r\nwalloped me with it.\r\n\r\n'You keep quiet when you're told,' he said.\r\n\r\nHe really was the shyest man I had ever met. It seemed to hurt him to\r\nbe spoken to. However, he was the boss, and I had to humour him, so I\r\ndidn't say any more.\r\n\r\nWe went down to the country that night, just as the man had told the\r\npoliceman we would. I was all worked up, for I had heard so much about\r\nthe country from Fred that I had always wanted to go there. Fred used\r\nto go off on a motor-bicycle sometimes to spend the night with his\r\nfather in Kent, and once he brought back a squirrel with him, which I\r\nthought was for me to eat, but mother said no. 'The first thing a dog\r\nhas to learn,' mother used often to say, 'is that the whole world\r\nwasn't created for him to eat.'\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when we got to the country, but the man seemed to\r\nknow where to go. He pulled at my rope, and we began to walk along a\r\nroad with no people in it at all. We walked on and on, but it was all\r\nso new to me that I forgot how tired I was. I could feel my mind\r\nbroadening with every step I took.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then we would pass a very big house, which looked as if\r\nit was empty, but I knew that there was a caretaker inside, because of\r\nFred's father. These big houses belong to very rich people, but they\r\ndon't want to live in them till the summer, so they put in caretakers,\r\nand the caretakers have a dog to keep off burglars. I wondered if that\r\nwas what I had been brought here for.\r\n\r\n'Are you going to be a caretaker?' I asked the man.\r\n\r\n'Shut up,' he said.\r\n\r\nSo I shut up.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been walking a long time, we came to a cottage. A man came\r\nout. My man seemed to know him, for he called him Bill. I was quite\r\nsurprised to see the man was not at all shy with Bill. They seemed very\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\n'Is that him?' said Bill, looking at me.\r\n\r\n'Bought him this afternoon,' said the man.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Bill, 'he's ugly enough. He looks fierce. If you want a\r\ndog, he's the sort of dog you want. But what do you want one for? It\r\nseems to me it's a lot of trouble to take, when there's no need of any\r\ntrouble at all. Why not do what I've always wanted to do? What's wrong\r\nwith just fixing the dog, same as it's always done, and walking in and\r\nhelping yourself?'\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you what's wrong,' said the man. 'To start with, you can't\r\nget at the dog to fix him except by day, when they let him out. At\r\nnight he's shut up inside the house. And suppose you do fix him during\r\nthe day what happens then? Either the bloke gets another before night,\r\nor else he sits up all night with a gun. It isn't like as if these\r\nblokes was ordinary blokes. They're down here to look after the house.\r\nThat's their job, and they don't take any chances.'\r\n\r\nIt was the longest speech I had ever heard the man make, and it seemed\r\nto impress Bill. He was quite humble.\r\n\r\n'I didn't think of that,' he said. 'We'd best start in to train this\r\ntyke at once.'\r\n\r\nMother often used to say, when I went on about wanting to go out into\r\nthe world and see life, 'You'll be sorry when you do. The world isn't\r\nall bones and liver.' And I hadn't been living with the man and Bill in\r\ntheir cottage long before I found out how right she was.\r\n\r\nIt was the man's shyness that made all the trouble. It seemed as if he\r\nhated to be taken notice of.\r\n\r\nIt started on my very first night at the cottage. I had fallen asleep\r\nin the kitchen, tired out after all the excitement of the day and the\r\nlong walks I had had, when something woke me with a start. It was\r\nsomebody scratching at the window, trying to get in.\r\n\r\nWell, I ask you, I ask any dog, what would you have done in my place?\r\nEver since I was old enough to listen, mother had told me over and over\r\nagain what I must do in a case like this. It is the A B C of a dog's\r\neducation. 'If you are in a room and you hear anyone trying to get in,'\r\nmother used to say, 'bark. It may be someone who has business there, or\r\nit may not. Bark first, and inquire afterwards. Dogs were made to be\r\nheard and not seen.'\r\n\r\nI lifted my head and yelled. I have a good, deep voice, due to a hound\r\nstrain in my pedigree, and at the public-house, when there was a full\r\nmoon, I have often had people leaning out of the windows and saying\r\nthings all down the street. I took a deep breath and let it go.\r\n\r\n'Man!' I shouted. 'Bill! Man! Come quick! Here's a burglar getting in!'\r\n\r\nThen somebody struck a light, and it was the man himself. He had come\r\nin through the window.\r\n\r\nHe picked up a stick, and he walloped me. I couldn't understand it. I\r\ncouldn't see where I had done the wrong thing. But he was the boss, so\r\nthere was nothing to be said.\r\n\r\nIf you'll believe me, that same thing happened every night. Every\r\nsingle night! And sometimes twice or three times before morning. And\r\nevery time I would bark my loudest and the man would strike a light and\r\nwallop me. The thing was baffling. I couldn't possibly have mistaken\r\nwhat mother had said to me. She said it too often for that. Bark! Bark!\r\nBark! It was the main plank of her whole system of education. And yet,\r\nhere I was, getting walloped every night for doing it.\r\n\r\nI thought it out till my head ached, and finally I got it right. I\r\nbegan to see that mother's outlook was narrow. No doubt, living with a\r\nman like master at the public-house, a man without a trace of shyness\r\nin his composition, barking was all right. But circumstances alter\r\ncases. I belonged to a man who was a mass of nerves, who got the jumps\r\nif you spoke to him. What I had to do was to forget the training I had\r\nhad from mother, sound as it no doubt was as a general thing, and to\r\nadapt myself to the needs of the particular man who had happened to buy\r\nme. I had tried mother's way, and all it had brought me was walloping,\r\nso now I would think for myself.\r\n\r\nSo next night, when I heard the window go, I lay there without a word,\r\nthough it went against all my better feelings. I didn't even growl.\r\nSomeone came in and moved about in the dark, with a lantern, but,\r\nthough I smelt that it was the man, I didn't ask him a single question.\r\nAnd presently the man lit a light and came over to me and gave me a\r\npat, which was a thing he had never done before.\r\n\r\n'Good dog!' he said. 'Now you can have this.'\r\n\r\nAnd he let me lick out the saucepan in which the dinner had been\r\ncooked.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we got on fine. Whenever I heard anyone at the window I\r\njust kept curled up and took no notice, and every time I got a bone or\r\nsomething good. It was easy, once you had got the hang of things.\r\n\r\nIt was about a week after that the man took me out one morning, and we\r\nwalked a long way till we turned in at some big gates and went along a\r\nvery smooth road till we came to a great house, standing all by itself\r\nin the middle of a whole lot of country. There was a big lawn in front\r\nof it, and all round there were fields and trees, and at the back a\r\ngreat wood.\r\n\r\nThe man rang a bell, and the door opened, and an old man came out.\r\n\r\n'Well?' he said, not very cordially.\r\n\r\n'I thought you might want to buy a good watch-dog,' said the man.\r\n\r\n'Well, that's queer, your saying that,' said the caretaker. 'It's a\r\ncoincidence. That's exactly what I do want to buy. I was just thinking\r\nof going along and trying to get one. My old dog picked up something\r\nthis morning that he oughtn't to have, and he's dead, poor feller.'\r\n\r\n'Poor feller,' said the man. 'Found an old bone with phosphorus on it,\r\nI guess.'\r\n\r\n'What do you want for this one?'\r\n\r\n'Five shillings.'\r\n\r\n'Is he a good watch-dog?'\r\n\r\n'He's a grand watch-dog.'\r\n\r\n'He looks fierce enough.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!'\r\n\r\nSo the caretaker gave the man his five shillings, and the man went off\r\nand left me.\r\n\r\nAt first the newness of everything and the unaccustomed smells and\r\ngetting to know the caretaker, who was a nice old man, prevented my\r\nmissing the man, but as the day went on and I began to realize that he\r\nhad gone and would never come back, I got very depressed. I pattered\r\nall over the house, whining. It was a most interesting house, bigger\r\nthan I thought a house could possibly be, but it couldn't cheer me up.\r\nYou may think it strange that I should pine for the man, after all the\r\nwallopings he had given me, and it is odd, when you come to think of\r\nit. But dogs are dogs, and they are built like that. By the time it was\r\nevening I was thoroughly miserable. I found a shoe and an old\r\nclothes-brush in one of the rooms, but could eat nothing. I just sat\r\nand moped.\r\n\r\nIt's a funny thing, but it seems as if it always happened that just\r\nwhen you are feeling most miserable, something nice happens. As I sat\r\nthere, there came from outside the sound of a motor-bicycle, and\r\nsomebody shouted.\r\n\r\nIt was dear old Fred, my old pal Fred, the best old boy that ever\r\nstepped. I recognized his voice in a second, and I was scratching at\r\nthe door before the old man had time to get up out of his chair.\r\n\r\nWell, well, well! That was a pleasant surprise! I ran five times round\r\nthe lawn without stopping, and then I came back and jumped up at him.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing down here, Fred?' I said. 'Is this caretaker your\r\nfather? Have you seen the rabbits in the wood? How long are you going\r\nto stop? How's mother? I like the country. Have you come all the way\r\nfrom the public-house? I'm living here now. Your father gave five\r\nshillings for me. That's twice as much as I was worth when I saw you\r\nlast.'\r\n\r\n'Why, it's young Nigger!' That was what they called me at the saloon.\r\n'What are you doing here? Where did you get this dog, father?'\r\n\r\n'A man sold him to me this morning. Poor old Bob got poisoned. This one\r\nought to be just as good a watch-dog. He barks loud enough.'\r\n\r\n'He should be. His mother is the best watch-dog in London. This\r\ncheese-hound used to belong to the boss. Funny him getting down here.'\r\n\r\nWe went into the house and had supper. And after supper we sat and\r\ntalked. Fred was only down for the night, he said, because the boss\r\nwanted him back next day.\r\n\r\n'And I'd sooner have my job, than yours, dad,' he said. 'Of all the\r\nlonely places! I wonder you aren't scared of burglars.'\r\n\r\n'I've my shot-gun, and there's the dog. I might be scared if it wasn't\r\nfor him, but he kind of gives me confidence. Old Bob was the same. Dogs\r\nare a comfort in the country.'\r\n\r\n'Get many tramps here?'\r\n\r\n'I've only seen one in two months, and that's the feller who sold me\r\nthe dog here.'\r\n\r\nAs they were talking about the man, I asked Fred if he knew him. They\r\nmight have met at the public-house, when the man was buying me from the\r\nboss.\r\n\r\n'You would like him,' I said. 'I wish you could have met.'\r\n\r\nThey both looked at me.\r\n\r\n'What's he growling at?' asked Fred. 'Think he heard something?'\r\n\r\nThe old man laughed.\r\n\r\n'He wasn't growling. He was talking in his sleep. You're nervous, Fred.\r\nIt comes of living in the city.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I am. I like this place in the daytime, but it gives me the pip\r\nat night. It's so quiet. How you can stand it here all the time, I\r\ncan't understand. Two nights of it would have me seeing things.'\r\n\r\nHis father laughed.\r\n\r\n'If you feel like that, Fred, you had better take the gun to bed with\r\nyou. I shall be quite happy without it.'\r\n\r\n'I will,' said Fred. 'I'll take six if you've got them.'\r\n\r\nAnd after that they went upstairs. I had a basket in the hall, which\r\nhad belonged to Bob, the dog who had got poisoned. It was a comfortable\r\nbasket, but I was so excited at having met Fred again that I couldn't\r\nsleep. Besides, there was a smell of mice somewhere, and I had to move\r\naround, trying to place it.\r\n\r\nI was just sniffing at a place in the wall, when I heard a scratching\r\nnoise. At first I thought it was the mice working in a different place,\r\nbut, when I listened, I found that the sound came from the window.\r\nSomebody was doing something to it from outside.\r\n\r\nIf it had been mother, she would have lifted the roof off right there,\r\nand so should I, if it hadn't been for what the man had taught me. I\r\ndidn't think it possible that this could be the man come back, for he\r\nhad gone away and said nothing about ever seeing me again. But I didn't\r\nbark. I stopped where I was and listened. And presently the window came\r\nopen, and somebody began to climb in.\r\n\r\nI gave a good sniff, and I knew it was the man.\r\n\r\nI was so delighted that for a moment I nearly forgot myself and shouted\r\nwith joy, but I remembered in time how shy he was, and stopped myself.\r\nBut I ran to him and jumped up quite quietly, and he told me to lie\r\ndown. I was disappointed that he didn't seem more pleased to see me. I\r\nlay down.\r\n\r\nIt was very dark, but he had brought a lantern with him, and I could\r\nsee him moving about the room, picking things up and putting them in a\r\nbag which he had brought with him. Every now and then he would stop and\r\nlisten, and then he would start moving round again. He was very quick\r\nabout it, but very quiet. It was plain that he didn't want Fred or his\r\nfather to come down and find him.\r\n\r\nI kept thinking about this peculiarity of his while I watched him. I\r\nsuppose, being chummy myself, I find it hard to understand that\r\neverybody else in the world isn't chummy too. Of course, my experience\r\nat the public-house had taught me that men are just as different from\r\neach other as dogs. If I chewed master's shoe, for instance, he used to\r\nkick me; but if I chewed Fred's, Fred would tickle me under the ear.\r\nAnd, similarly, some men are shy and some men are mixers. I quite\r\nappreciated that, but I couldn't help feeling that the man carried\r\nshyness to a point where it became morbid. And he didn't give himself a\r\nchance to cure himself of it. That was the point. Imagine a man hating\r\nto meet people so much that he never visited their houses till the\r\nmiddle of the night, when they were in bed and asleep. It was silly.\r\nShyness has always been something so outside my nature that I suppose I\r\nhave never really been able to look at it sympathetically. I have\r\nalways held the view that you can get over it if you make an effort.\r\nThe trouble with the man was that he wouldn't make an effort. He went\r\nout of his way to avoid meeting people.\r\n\r\nI was fond of the man. He was the sort of person you never get to know\r\nvery well, but we had been together for quite a while, and I wouldn't\r\nhave been a dog if I hadn't got attached to him.\r\n\r\nAs I sat and watched him creep about the room, it suddenly came to me\r\nthat here was a chance of doing him a real good turn in spite of\r\nhimself. Fred was upstairs, and Fred, as I knew by experience, was the\r\neasiest man to get along with in the world. Nobody could be shy with\r\nFred. I felt that if only I could bring him and the man together, they\r\nwould get along splendidly, and it would teach the man not to be silly\r\nand avoid people. It would help to give him the confidence which he\r\nneeded. I had seen him with Bill, and I knew that he could be perfectly\r\nnatural and easy when he liked.\r\n\r\nIt was true that the man might object at first, but after a while he\r\nwould see that I had acted simply for his good, and would be grateful.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was, how to get Fred down without scaring the man. I\r\nknew that if I shouted he wouldn't wait, but would be out of the window\r\nand away before Fred could get there. What I had to do was to go to\r\nFred's room, explain the whole situation quietly to him, and ask him to\r\ncome down and make himself pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe man was far too busy to pay any attention to me. He was kneeling in\r\na corner with his back to me, putting something in his bag. I seized\r\nthe opportunity to steal softly from the room.\r\n\r\nFred's door was shut, and I could hear him snoring. I scratched gently,\r\nand then harder, till I heard the snores stop. He got out of bed and\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n'Don't make a noise,' I whispered. 'Come on downstairs. I want you to\r\nmeet a friend of mine.'\r\n\r\nAt first he was quite peevish.\r\n\r\n'What's the idea,' he said, 'coming and spoiling a man's beauty-sleep?\r\nGet out.'\r\n\r\nHe actually started to go back into the room.\r\n\r\n'No, honestly, Fred,' I said, 'I'm not fooling you. There is a man\r\ndownstairs. He got in through the window. I want you to meet him. He's\r\nvery shy, and I think it will do him good to have a chat with you.'\r\n\r\n'What are you whining about?' Fred began, and then he broke off\r\nsuddenly and listened. We could both hear the man's footsteps as he\r\nmoved about.\r\n\r\nFred jumped back into the room. He came out, carrying something. He\r\ndidn't say any more but started to go downstairs, very quiet, and I\r\nwent after him.\r\n\r\nThere was the man, still putting things in his bag. I was just going to\r\nintroduce Fred, when Fred, the silly ass, gave a great yell.\r\n\r\nI could have bitten him.\r\n\r\n'What did you want to do that for, you chump?' I said 'I told you he\r\nwas shy. Now you've scared him.'\r\n\r\nHe certainly had. The man was out of the window quicker than you would\r\nhave believed possible. He just flew out. I called after him that it\r\nwas only Fred and me, but at that moment a gun went off with a\r\ntremendous bang, so he couldn't have heard me.\r\n\r\nI was pretty sick about it. The whole thing had gone wrong. Fred seemed\r\nto have lost his head entirely. He was behaving like a perfect ass.\r\nNaturally the man had been frightened with him carrying on in that way.\r\nI jumped out of the window to see if I could find the man and explain,\r\nbut he was gone. Fred jumped out after me, and nearly squashed me.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch dark out there. I couldn't see a thing. But I knew the man\r\ncould not have gone far, or I should have heard him. I started to sniff\r\nround on the chance of picking up his trail. It wasn't long before I\r\nstruck it.\r\n\r\nFred's father had come down now, and they were running about. The old\r\nman had a light. I followed the trail, and it ended at a large\r\ncedar-tree, not far from the house. I stood underneath it and looked\r\nup, but of course I could not see anything.\r\n\r\n'Are you up there?' I shouted. 'There's nothing to be scared at. It was\r\nonly Fred. He's an old pal of mine. He works at the place where you\r\nbought me. His gun went off by accident. He won't hurt you.'\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a sound. I began to think I must have made a mistake.\r\n\r\n'He's got away,' I heard Fred say to his father, and just as he said it\r\nI caught a faint sound of someone moving in the branches above me.\r\n\r\n'No he hasn't!' I shouted. 'He's up this tree.'\r\n\r\n'I believe the dog's found him, dad!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he's up here. Come along and meet him.'\r\n\r\nFred came to the foot of the tree.\r\n\r\n'You up there,' he said, 'come along down.'\r\n\r\nNot a sound from the tree.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' I explained, 'he _is_ up there, but he's very shy. Ask\r\nhim again.'\r\n\r\n'All right,' said Fred. 'Stay there if you want to. But I'm going to\r\nshoot off this gun into the branches just for fun.'\r\n\r\nAnd then the man started to come down. As soon as he touched the ground\r\nI jumped up at him.\r\n\r\n'This is fine!' I said 'Here's my friend Fred. You'll like him.'\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't any good. They didn't get along together at all. They\r\nhardly spoke. The man went into the house, and Fred went after him,\r\ncarrying his gun. And when they got into the house it was just the\r\nsame. The man sat in one chair, and Fred sat in another, and after a\r\nlong time some men came in a motor-car, and the man went away with\r\nthem. He didn't say good-bye to me.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Fred and his father made a great fuss of me. I\r\ncouldn't understand it. Men are so odd. The man wasn't a bit pleased\r\nthat I had brought him and Fred together, but Fred seemed as if he\r\ncouldn't do enough for me for having introduced him to the man.\r\nHowever, Fred's father produced some cold ham--my favourite dish--and\r\ngave me quite a lot of it, so I stopped worrying over the thing. As\r\nmother used to say, 'Don't bother your head about what doesn't concern\r\nyou. The only thing a dog need concern himself with is the\r\nbill-of-fare. Eat your bun, and don't make yourself busy about other\r\npeople's affairs.' Mother's was in some ways a narrow outlook, but she\r\nhad a great fund of sterling common sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _He Moves in Society_\r\n\r\nIt was one of those things which are really nobody's fault. It was not\r\nthe chauffeur's fault, and it was not mine. I was having a friendly\r\nturn-up with a pal of mine on the side-walk; he ran across the road; I\r\nran after him; and the car came round the corner and hit me. It must\r\nhave been going pretty slow, or I should have been killed. As it was, I\r\njust had the breath knocked out of me. You know how you feel when the\r\nbutcher catches you just as you are edging out of the shop with a bit\r\nof meat. It was like that.\r\n\r\nI wasn't taking much interest in things for awhile, but when I did I\r\nfound that I was the centre of a group of three--the chauffeur, a small\r\nboy, and the small boy's nurse.\r\n\r\nThe small boy was very well-dressed, and looked delicate. He was\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n'Poor doggie,' he said, 'poor doggie.'\r\n\r\n'It wasn't my fault, Master Peter,' said the chauffeur respectfully.\r\n'He run out into the road before I seen him.'\r\n\r\n'That's right,' I put in, for I didn't want to get the man into\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n'Oh, he's not dead,' said the small boy. 'He barked.'\r\n\r\n'He growled,' said the nurse. 'Come away, Master Peter. He might bite\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nWomen are trying sometimes. It is almost as if they deliberately\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\n'I won't come away. I'm going to take him home with me and send for the\r\ndoctor to come and see him. He's going to be my dog.'\r\n\r\nThis sounded all right. Goodness knows I am no snob, and can rough it\r\nwhen required, but I do like comfort when it comes my way, and it\r\nseemed to me that this was where I got it. And I liked the boy. He was\r\nthe right sort.\r\n\r\nThe nurse, a very unpleasant woman, had to make objections.\r\n\r\n'Master Peter! You can't take him home, a great, rough, fierce, common\r\ndog! What would your mother say?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to take him home,' repeated the child, with a determination\r\nwhich I heartily admired, 'and he's going to be my dog. I shall call\r\nhim Fido.'\r\n\r\nThere's always a catch in these good things. Fido is a name I\r\nparticularly detest. All dogs do. There was a dog called that that I\r\nknew once, and he used to get awfully sick when we shouted it out after\r\nhim in the street. No doubt there have been respectable dogs called\r\nFido, but to my mind it is a name like Aubrey or Clarence. You may be\r\nable to live it down, but you start handicapped. However, one must take\r\nthe rough with the smooth, and I was prepared to yield the point.\r\n\r\n'If you wait, Master Peter, your father will buy you a beautiful,\r\nlovely dog....'\r\n\r\n'I don't want a beautiful, lovely dog. I want this dog.'\r\n\r\nThe slur did not wound me. I have no illusions about my looks. Mine is\r\nan honest, but not a beautiful, face.\r\n\r\n'It's no use talking,' said the chauffeur, grinning. 'He means to have\r\nhim. Shove him in, and let's be getting back, or they'll be thinking\r\nHis Nibs has been kidnapped.'\r\n\r\nSo I was carried to the car. I could have walked, but I had an idea\r\nthat I had better not. I had made my hit as a crippled dog, and a\r\ncrippled dog I intended to remain till things got more settled down.\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur started the car off again. What with the shock I had had\r\nand the luxury of riding in a motor-car, I was a little distrait, and I\r\ncould not say how far we went. But it must have been miles and miles,\r\nfor it seemed a long time afterwards that we stopped at the biggest\r\nhouse I have ever seen. There were smooth lawns and flower-beds, and\r\nmen in overalls, and fountains and trees, and, away to the right,\r\nkennels with about a million dogs in them, all pushing their noses\r\nthrough the bars and shouting. They all wanted to know who I was and\r\nwhat prizes I had won, and then I realized that I was moving in high\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nI let the small boy pick me up and carry me into the house, though it\r\nwas all he could do, poor kid, for I was some weight. He staggered up\r\nthe steps and along a great hall, and then let me flop on the carpet of\r\nthe most beautiful room you ever saw. The carpet was a yard thick.\r\n\r\nThere was a woman sitting in a chair, and as soon as she saw me she\r\ngave a shriek.\r\n\r\n'I told Master Peter you would not be pleased, m'lady,' said the nurse,\r\nwho seemed to have taken a positive dislike to me, 'but he would bring\r\nthe nasty brute home.'\r\n\r\n'He's not a nasty brute, mother. He's my dog, and his name's Fido. John\r\nran over him in the car, and I brought him home to live with us. I love\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\nThis seemed to make an impression. Peter's mother looked as if she were\r\nweakening.\r\n\r\n'But, Peter, dear, I don't know what your father will say. He's so\r\nparticular about dogs. All his dogs are prize-winners, pedigree dogs.\r\nThis is such a mongrel.'\r\n\r\n'A nasty, rough, ugly, common dog, m'lady,' said the nurse, sticking\r\nher oar in in an absolutely uncalled-for way.\r\n\r\nJust then a man came into the room.\r\n\r\n'What on earth?' he said, catching sight of me.\r\n\r\n'It's a dog Peter has brought home. He says he wants to keep him.'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to keep him,' corrected Peter firmly.\r\n\r\nI do like a child that knows his own mind. I was getting fonder of\r\nPeter every minute. I reached up and licked his hand.\r\n\r\n'See! He knows he's my dog, don't you, Fido? He licked me.'\r\n\r\n'But, Peter, he looks so fierce.' This, unfortunately, is true. I do\r\nlook fierce. It is rather a misfortune for a perfectly peaceful dog.\r\n'I'm sure it's not safe your having him.'\r\n\r\n'He's my dog, and his name's Fido. I am going to tell cook to give him\r\na bone.'\r\n\r\nHis mother looked at his father, who gave rather a nasty laugh.\r\n\r\n'My dear Helen,' he said, 'ever since Peter was born, ten years ago, he\r\nhas not asked for a single thing, to the best of my recollection, which\r\nhe has not got. Let us be consistent. I don't approve of this\r\ncaricature of a dog, but if Peter wants him, I suppose he must have\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'Very well. But the first sign of viciousness he shows, he shall be\r\nshot. He makes me nervous.'\r\n\r\nSo they left it at that, and I went off with Peter to get my bone.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, he took me to the kennels to introduce me to the other\r\ndogs. I had to go, but I knew it would not be pleasant, and it wasn't.\r\nAny dog will tell you what these prize-ribbon dogs are like. Their\r\nheads are so swelled they have to go into their kennels backwards.\r\n\r\nIt was just as I had expected. There were mastiffs, terriers, poodles,\r\nspaniels, bulldogs, sheepdogs, and every other kind of dog you can\r\nimagine, all prize-winners at a hundred shows, and every single dog in\r\nthe place just shoved his head back and laughed himself sick. I never\r\nfelt so small in my life, and I was glad when it was over and Peter\r\ntook me off to the stables.\r\n\r\nI was just feeling that I never wanted to see another dog in my life,\r\nwhen a terrier ran out, shouting. As soon as he saw me, he came up\r\ninquiringly, walking very stiff-legged, as terriers do when they see a\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n'Well,' I said, 'and what particular sort of a prize-winner are you?\r\nTell me all about the ribbons they gave you at the Crystal Palace, and\r\nlet's get it over.'\r\n\r\nHe laughed in a way that did me good.\r\n\r\n'Guess again!' he said. 'Did you take me for one of the nuts in the\r\nkennels? My name's Jack, and I belong to one of the grooms.'\r\n\r\n'What!' I cried. 'You aren't Champion Bowlegs Royal or anything of that\r\nsort! I'm glad to meet you.'\r\n\r\nSo we rubbed noses as friendly as you please. It was a treat meeting\r\none of one's own sort. I had had enough of those high-toned dogs who\r\nlook at you as if you were something the garbage-man had forgotten to\r\ntake away.\r\n\r\n'So you've been talking to the swells, have you?' said Jack.\r\n\r\n'He would take me,' I said, pointing to Peter.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you're his latest, are you? Then you're all right--while it\r\nlasts.'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean, while it lasts?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll tell you what happened to me. Young Peter took a great\r\nfancy to me once. Couldn't do enough for me for a while. Then he got\r\ntired of me, and out I went. You see, the trouble is that while he's a\r\nperfectly good kid, he has always had everything he wanted since he was\r\nborn, and he gets tired of things pretty easy. It was a toy railway\r\nthat finished me. Directly he got that, I might not have been on the\r\nearth. It was lucky for me that Dick, my present old man, happened to\r\nwant a dog to keep down the rats, or goodness knows what might not have\r\nhappened to me. They aren't keen on dogs here unless they've pulled\r\ndown enough blue ribbons to sink a ship, and mongrels like you and\r\nme--no offence--don't last long. I expect you noticed that the\r\ngrown-ups didn't exactly cheer when you arrived?'\r\n\r\n'They weren't chummy.'\r\n\r\n'Well take it from me, your only chance is to make them chummy. If you\r\ndo something to please them, they might let you stay on, even though\r\nPeter was tired of you.'\r\n\r\n'What sort of thing?'\r\n\r\n'That's for you to think out. I couldn't find one. I might tell you to\r\nsave Peter from drowning. You don't need a pedigree to do that. But you\r\ncan't drag the kid to the lake and push him in. That's the trouble. A\r\ndog gets so few opportunities. But, take it from me, if you don't do\r\nsomething within two weeks to make yourself solid with the adults, you\r\ncan make your will. In two weeks Peter will have forgotten all about\r\nyou. It's not his fault. It's the way he has been brought up. His\r\nfather has all the money on earth, and Peter's the only child. You\r\ncan't blame him. All I say is, look out for yourself. Well, I'm glad to\r\nhave met you. Drop in again when you can. I can give you some good\r\nratting, and I have a bone or two put away. So long.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt worried me badly what Jack had said. I couldn't get it out of my\r\nmind. If it hadn't been for that, I should have had a great time, for\r\nPeter certainly made a lot of fuss of me. He treated me as if I were\r\nthe only friend he had.\r\n\r\nAnd, in a way, I was. When you are the only son of a man who has all\r\nthe money in the world, it seems that you aren't allowed to be like an\r\nordinary kid. They coop you up, as if you were something precious that\r\nwould be contaminated by contact with other children. In all the time\r\nthat I was at the house I never met another child. Peter had everything\r\nin the world, except someone of his own age to go round with; and that\r\nmade him different from any of the kids I had known.\r\n\r\nHe liked talking to me. I was the only person round who really\r\nunderstood him. He would talk by the hour and I would listen with my\r\ntongue hanging out and nod now and then.\r\n\r\nIt was worth listening to, what he used to tell me. He told me the most\r\nsurprising things. I didn't know, for instance, that there were any Red\r\nIndians in England but he said there was a chief named Big Cloud who\r\nlived in the rhododendron bushes by the lake. I never found him, though\r\nI went carefully through them one day. He also said that there were\r\npirates on the island in the lake. I never saw them either.\r\n\r\nWhat he liked telling me about best was the city of gold and precious\r\nstones which you came to if you walked far enough through the woods at\r\nthe back of the stables. He was always meaning to go off there some\r\nday, and, from the way he described it, I didn't blame him. It was\r\ncertainly a pretty good city. It was just right for dogs, too, he said,\r\nhaving bones and liver and sweet cakes there and everything else a dog\r\ncould want. It used to make my mouth water to listen to him.\r\n\r\nWe were never apart. I was with him all day, and I slept on the mat in\r\nhis room at night. But all the time I couldn't get out of my mind what\r\nJack had said. I nearly did once, for it seemed to me that I was so\r\nnecessary to Peter that nothing could separate us; but just as I was\r\nfeeling safe his father gave him a toy aeroplane, which flew when you\r\nwound it up. The day he got it, I might not have been on the earth. I\r\ntrailed along, but he hadn't a word to say to me.\r\n\r\nWell, something went wrong with the aeroplane the second day, and it\r\nwouldn't fly, and then I was in solid again; but I had done some hard\r\nthinking and I knew just where I stood. I was the newest toy, that's\r\nwhat I was, and something newer might come along at any moment, and\r\nthen it would be the finish for me. The only thing for me was to do\r\nsomething to impress the adults, just as Jack had said.\r\n\r\nGoodness knows I tried. But everything I did turned out wrong. There\r\nseemed to be a fate about it. One morning, for example, I was trotting\r\nround the house early, and I met a fellow I could have sworn was a\r\nburglar. He wasn't one of the family, and he wasn't one of the\r\nservants, and he was hanging round the house in a most suspicious way.\r\nI chased him up a tree, and it wasn't till the family came down to\r\nbreakfast, two hours later, that I found that he was a guest who had\r\narrived overnight, and had come out early to enjoy the freshness of the\r\nmorning and the sun shining on the lake, he being that sort of man.\r\nThat didn't help me much.\r\n\r\nNext, I got in wrong with the boss, Peter's father. I don't know why. I\r\nmet him out in the park with another man, both carrying bundles of\r\nsticks and looking very serious and earnest. Just as I reached him, the\r\nboss lifted one of the sticks and hit a small white ball with it. He\r\nhad never seemed to want to play with me before, and I took it as a\r\ngreat compliment. I raced after the ball, which he had hit quite a long\r\nway, picked it up in my mouth, and brought it back to him. I laid it at\r\nhis feet, and smiled up at him.\r\n\r\n'Hit it again,' I said.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't pleased at all. He said all sorts of things and tried to kick\r\nme, and that night, when he thought I was not listening, I heard him\r\ntelling his wife that I was a pest and would have to be got rid of.\r\nThat made me think.\r\n\r\nAnd then I put the lid on it. With the best intentions in the world I\r\ngot myself into such a mess that I thought the end had come.\r\n\r\nIt happened one afternoon in the drawing-room. There were visitors that\r\nday--women; and women seem fatal to me. I was in the background, trying\r\nnot to be seen, for, though I had been brought in by Peter, the family\r\nnever liked my coming into the drawing-room. I was hoping for a piece\r\nof cake and not paying much attention to the conversation, which was\r\nall about somebody called Toto, whom I had not met. Peter's mother said\r\nToto was a sweet little darling, he was; and one of the visitors said\r\nToto had not been at all himself that day and she was quite worried.\r\nAnd a good lot more about how all that Toto would ever take for dinner\r\nwas a little white meat of chicken, chopped up fine. It was not very\r\ninteresting, and I had allowed my attention to wander.\r\n\r\nAnd just then, peeping round the corner of my chair to see if there\r\nwere any signs of cake, what should I see but a great beastly brute of\r\na rat. It was standing right beside the visitor, drinking milk out of a\r\nsaucer, if you please!\r\n\r\nI may have my faults, but procrastination in the presence of rats is\r\nnot one of them. I didn't hesitate for a second. Here was my chance. If\r\nthere is one thing women hate, it is a rat. Mother always used to say,\r\n'If you want to succeed in life, please the women. They are the real\r\nbosses. The men don't count.' By eliminating this rodent I should earn\r\nthe gratitude and esteem of Peter's mother, and, if I did that, it did\r\nnot matter what Peter's father thought of me.\r\n\r\nI sprang.\r\n\r\nThe rat hadn't a chance to get away. I was right on to him. I got hold\r\nof his neck, gave him a couple of shakes, and chucked him across the\r\nroom. Then I ran across to finish him off.\r\n\r\nJust as I reached him, he sat up and barked at me. I was never so taken\r\naback in my life. I pulled up short and stared at him.\r\n\r\n'I'm sure I beg your pardon, sir,' I said apologetically. 'I thought\r\nyou were a rat.'\r\n\r\nAnd then everything broke loose. Somebody got me by the collar,\r\nsomebody else hit me on the head with a parasol, and somebody else\r\nkicked me in the ribs. Everybody talked and shouted at the same time.\r\n\r\n'Poor darling Toto!' cried the visitor, snatching up the little animal.\r\n'Did the great savage brute try to murder you!'\r\n\r\n'So absolutely unprovoked!'\r\n\r\n'He just flew at the poor little thing!'\r\n\r\nIt was no good my trying to explain. Any dog in my place would have\r\nmade the same mistake. The creature was a toy-dog of one of those\r\nextraordinary breeds--a prize-winner and champion, and so on, of\r\ncourse, and worth his weight in gold. I would have done better to bite\r\nthe visitor than Toto. That much I gathered from the general run of the\r\nconversation, and then, having discovered that the door was shut, I\r\nedged under the sofa. I was embarrassed.\r\n\r\n'That settles it!' said Peter's mother. 'The dog is not safe. He must\r\nbe shot.'\r\n\r\nPeter gave a yell at this, but for once he didn't swing the voting an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n'Be quiet, Peter,' said his mother. 'It is not safe for you to have\r\nsuch a dog. He may be mad.'\r\n\r\nWomen are very unreasonable.\r\n\r\nToto, of course, wouldn't say a word to explain how the mistake arose.\r\nHe was sitting on the visitor's lap, shrieking about what he would have\r\ndone to me if they hadn't separated us.\r\n\r\nSomebody felt cautiously under the sofa. I recognized the shoes of\r\nWeeks, the butler. I suppose they had rung for him to come and take me,\r\nand I could see that he wasn't half liking it. I was sorry for Weeks,\r\nwho was a friend of mine, so I licked his hand, and that seemed to\r\ncheer him up a whole lot.\r\n\r\n'I have him now, madam,' I heard him say.\r\n\r\n'Take him to the stables and tie him up, Weeks, and tell one of the men\r\nto bring his gun and shoot him. He is not safe.'\r\n\r\nA few minutes later I was in an empty stall, tied up to the manger.\r\n\r\nIt was all over. It had been pleasant while it lasted, but I had\r\nreached the end of my tether now. I don't think I was frightened, but a\r\nsense of pathos stole over me. I had meant so well. It seemed as if\r\ngood intentions went for nothing in this world. I had tried so hard to\r\nplease everybody, and this was the result--tied up in a dark stable,\r\nwaiting for the end.\r\n\r\nThe shadows lengthened in the stable-yard, and still nobody came. I\r\nbegan to wonder if they had forgotten me, and presently, in spite of\r\nmyself, a faint hope began to spring up inside me that this might mean\r\nthat I was not to be shot after all. Perhaps Toto at the eleventh hour\r\nhad explained everything.\r\n\r\nAnd then footsteps sounded outside, and the hope died away. I shut my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nSomebody put his arms round my neck, and my nose touched a warm cheek.\r\nI opened my eyes. It was not the man with the gun come to shoot me. It\r\nwas Peter. He was breathing very hard, and he had been crying.\r\n\r\n'Quiet!' he whispered.\r\n\r\nHe began to untie the rope.\r\n\r\n'You must keep quite quiet, or they will hear us, and then we shall be\r\nstopped. I'm going to take you into the woods, and we'll walk and walk\r\nuntil we come to the city I told you about that's all gold and\r\ndiamonds, and we'll live there for the rest of our lives, and no one\r\nwill be able to hurt us. But you must keep very quiet.'\r\n\r\nHe went to the stable-gate and looked out. Then he gave a little\r\nwhistle to me to come after him. And we started out to find the city.\r\n\r\nThe woods were a long way away, down a hill of long grass and across a\r\nstream; and we went very carefully, keeping in the shadows and running\r\nacross the open spaces. And every now and then we would stop and look\r\nback, but there was nobody to be seen. The sun was setting, and\r\neverything was very cool and quiet.\r\n\r\nPresently we came to the stream and crossed it by a little wooden\r\nbridge, and then we were in the woods, where nobody could see us.\r\n\r\nI had never been in the woods before, and everything was very new and\r\nexciting to me. There were squirrels and rabbits and birds, more than I\r\nhad ever seen in my life, and little things that buzzed and flew and\r\ntickled my ears. I wanted to rush about and look at everything, but\r\nPeter called to me, and I came to heel. He knew where we were going,\r\nand I didn't, so I let him lead.\r\n\r\nWe went very slowly. The wood got thicker and thicker the farther we\r\ngot into it. There were bushes that were difficult to push through, and\r\nlong branches, covered with thorns, that reached out at you and tore at\r\nyou when you tried to get away. And soon it was quite dark, so dark\r\nthat I could see nothing, not even Peter, though he was so close. We\r\nwent slower and slower, and the darkness was full of queer noises. From\r\ntime to time Peter would stop, and I would run to him and put my nose\r\nin his hand. At first he patted me, but after a while he did not pat me\r\nany more, but just gave me his hand to lick, as if it was too much for\r\nhim to lift it. I think he was getting very tired. He was quite a small\r\nboy and not strong, and we had walked a long way.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be getting darker and darker. I could hear the sound of\r\nPeter's footsteps, and they seemed to drag as he forced his way through\r\nthe bushes. And then, quite suddenly, he sat down without any warning,\r\nand when I ran up I heard him crying.\r\n\r\nI suppose there are lots of dogs who would have known exactly the right\r\nthing to do, but I could not think of anything except to put my nose\r\nagainst his cheek and whine. He put his arm round my neck, and for a\r\nlong time we stayed like that, saying nothing. It seemed to comfort\r\nhim, for after a time he stopped crying.\r\n\r\nI did not bother him by asking about the wonderful city where we were\r\ngoing, for he was so tired. But I could not help wondering if we were\r\nnear it. There was not a sign of any city, nothing but darkness and odd\r\nnoises and the wind singing in the trees. Curious little animals, such\r\nas I had never smelt before, came creeping out of the bushes to look at\r\nus. I would have chased them, but Peter's arm was round my neck and I\r\ncould not leave him. But when something that smelt like a rabbit came\r\nso near that I could have reached out a paw and touched it, I turned my\r\nhead and snapped; and then they all scurried back into the bushes and\r\nthere were no more noises.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Then Peter gave a great gulp.\r\n\r\n'I'm not frightened,' he said. 'I'm not!'\r\n\r\nI shoved my head closer against his chest. There was another silence\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\n'I'm going to pretend we have been captured by brigands,' said Peter at\r\nlast. 'Are you listening? There were three of them, great big men with\r\nbeards, and they crept up behind me and snatched me up and took me out\r\nhere to their lair. This is their lair. One was called Dick, the\r\nothers' names were Ted and Alfred. They took hold of me and brought me\r\nall the way through the wood till we got here, and then they went off,\r\nmeaning to come back soon. And while they were away, you missed me and\r\ntracked me through the woods till you found me here. And then the\r\nbrigands came back, and they didn't know you were here, and you kept\r\nquite quiet till Dick was quite near, and then you jumped out and bit\r\nhim and he ran away. And then you bit Ted and you bit Alfred, and they\r\nran away too. And so we were left all alone, and I was quite safe\r\nbecause you were here to look after me. And then--And then--'\r\n\r\nHis voice died away, and the arm that was round my neck went limp, and\r\nI could hear by his breathing that he was asleep. His head was resting\r\non my back, but I didn't move. I wriggled a little closer to make him\r\nas comfortable as I could, and then I went to sleep myself.\r\n\r\nI didn't sleep very well. I had funny dreams all the time, thinking\r\nthese little animals were creeping up close enough out of the bushes\r\nfor me to get a snap at them without disturbing Peter.\r\n\r\nIf I woke once, I woke a dozen times, but there was never anything\r\nthere. The wind sang in the trees and the bushes rustled, and far away\r\nin the distance the frogs were calling.\r\n\r\nAnd then I woke once more with the feeling that this time something\r\nreally was coming through the bushes. I lifted my head as far as I\r\ncould, and listened. For a little while nothing happened, and then,\r\nstraight in front of me, I saw lights. And there was a sound of\r\ntrampling in the undergrowth.\r\n\r\nIt was no time to think about not waking Peter. This was something\r\ndefinite, something that had to be attended to quick. I was up with a\r\njump, yelling. Peter rolled off my back and woke up, and he sat there\r\nlistening, while I stood with my front paws on him and shouted at the\r\nmen. I was bristling all over. I didn't know who they were or what they\r\nwanted, but the way I looked at it was that anything could happen in\r\nthose woods at that time of night, and, if anybody was coming along to\r\nstart something, he had got to reckon with me.\r\n\r\nSomebody called, 'Peter! Are you there, Peter?'\r\n\r\nThere was a crashing in the bushes, the lights came nearer and nearer,\r\nand then somebody said 'Here he is!' and there was a lot of shouting. I\r\nstood where I was, ready to spring if necessary, for I was taking no\r\nchances.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' I shouted. 'What do you want?' A light flashed in my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n'Why, it's that dog!'\r\n\r\nSomebody came into the light, and I saw it was the boss. He was looking\r\nvery anxious and scared, and he scooped Peter up off the ground and\r\nhugged him tight.\r\n\r\nPeter was only half awake. He looked up at the boss drowsily, and began\r\nto talk about brigands, and Dick and Ted and Alfred, the same as he had\r\nsaid to me. There wasn't a sound till he had finished. Then the boss\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n'Kidnappers! I thought as much. And the dog drove them away!'\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our acquaintance he actually patted me.\r\n\r\n'Good old man!' he said.\r\n\r\n'He's my dog,' said Peter sleepily, 'and he isn't to be shot.'\r\n\r\n'He certainly isn't, my boy,' said the boss. 'From now on he's the\r\nhonoured guest. He shall wear a gold collar and order what he wants for\r\ndinner. And now let's be getting home. It's time you were in bed.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMother used to say, 'If you're a good dog, you will be happy. If you're\r\nnot, you won't,' but it seems to me that in this world it is all a\r\nmatter of luck. When I did everything I could to please people, they\r\nwanted to shoot me; and when I did nothing except run away, they\r\nbrought me back and treated me better than the most valuable\r\nprize-winner in the kennels. It was puzzling at first, but one day I\r\nheard the boss talking to a friend who had come down from the city.\r\n\r\nThe friend looked at me and said, 'What an ugly mongrel! Why on earth\r\ndo you have him about? I thought you were so particular about your\r\ndogs?'\r\n\r\nAnd the boss replied, 'He may be a mongrel, but he can have anything he\r\nwants in this house. Didn't you hear how he saved Peter from being\r\nkidnapped?'\r\n\r\nAnd out it all came about the brigands.\r\n\r\n'The kid called them brigands,' said the boss. 'I suppose that's how it\r\nwould strike a child of that age. But he kept mentioning the name Dick,\r\nand that put the police on the scent. It seems there's a kidnapper well\r\nknown to the police all over the country as Dick the Snatcher. It was\r\nalmost certainly that scoundrel and his gang. How they spirited the\r\nchild away, goodness knows, but they managed it, and the dog tracked\r\nthem and scared them off. We found him and Peter together in the woods.\r\nIt was a narrow escape, and we have to thank this animal here for it.'\r\n\r\nWhat could I say? It was no more use trying to put them right than it\r\nhad been when I mistook Toto for a rat. Peter had gone to sleep that\r\nnight pretending about the brigands to pass the time, and when he awoke\r\nhe still believed in them. He was that sort of child. There was nothing\r\nthat I could do about it.\r\n\r\nRound the corner, as the boss was speaking, I saw the kennel-man coming\r\nwith a plate in his hand. It smelt fine, and he was headed straight for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe put the plate down before me. It was liver, which I love.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' went on the boss, 'if it hadn't been for him, Peter would have\r\nbeen kidnapped and scared half to death, and I should be poorer, I\r\nsuppose, by whatever the scoundrels had chosen to hold me up for.'\r\n\r\nI am an honest dog, and hate to obtain credit under false pretences,\r\nbut--liver is liver. I let it go at that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROWNED HEADS\r\n\r\n\r\nKatie had never been more surprised in her life than when the serious\r\nyoung man with the brown eyes and the Charles Dana Gibson profile\r\nspirited her away from his friend and Genevieve. Till that moment she\r\nhad looked on herself as playing a sort of 'villager and retainer' part\r\nto the brown-eyed young man's hero and Genevieve's heroine. She knew\r\nshe was not pretty, though somebody (unidentified) had once said that\r\nshe had nice eyes; whereas Genevieve was notoriously a beauty,\r\nincessantly pestered, so report had it, by musical comedy managers to\r\ngo on the stage.\r\n\r\nGenevieve was tall and blonde, a destroyer of masculine peace of mind.\r\nShe said 'harf' and 'rahther', and might easily have been taken for an\r\nEnglish duchess instead of a cloak-model at Macey's. You would have\r\nsaid, in short, that, in the matter of personable young men, Genevieve\r\nwould have swept the board. Yet, here was this one deliberately\r\nselecting her, Katie, for his companion. It was almost a miracle.\r\n\r\nHe had managed it with the utmost dexterity at the merry-go-round. With\r\nwinning politeness he had assisted Genevieve on her wooden steed, and\r\nthen, as the machinery began to work, had grasped Katie's arm and led\r\nher at a rapid walk out into the sunlight. Katie's last glimpse of\r\nGenevieve had been the sight of her amazed and offended face as it\r\nwhizzed round the corner, while the steam melodeon drowned protests\r\nwith a spirited plunge into 'Alexander's Ragtime Band'.\r\n\r\nKatie felt shy. This young man was a perfect stranger. It was true she\r\nhad had a formal introduction to him, but only from Genevieve, who had\r\nscraped acquaintance with him exactly two minutes previously. It had\r\nhappened on the ferry-boat on the way to Palisades Park. Genevieve's\r\nbright eye, roving among the throng on the lower deck, had singled out\r\nthis young man and his companion as suitable cavaliers for the\r\nexpedition. The young man pleased her, and his friend, with the broken\r\nnose and the face like a good-natured bulldog, was obviously suitable\r\nfor Katie.\r\n\r\nEtiquette is not rigid on New York ferry-boats. Without fuss or delay\r\nshe proceeded to make their acquaintance--to Katie's concern, for she\r\ncould never get used to Genevieve's short way with strangers. The quiet\r\nlife she had led had made her almost prudish, and there were times when\r\nGenevieve's conduct shocked her. Of course, she knew there was no harm\r\nin Genevieve. As the latter herself had once put it, 'The feller that\r\ntries to get gay with me is going to get a call-down that'll make him\r\nholler for his winter overcoat.' But all the same she could not\r\napprove. And the net result of her disapproval was to make her shy and\r\nsilent as she walked by this young man's side.\r\n\r\nThe young man seemed to divine her thoughts.\r\n\r\n'Say, I'm on the level,' he observed. 'You want to get that. Right on\r\nthe square. See?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes,' said Katie, relieved but yet embarrassed. It was awkward to\r\nhave one's thoughts read like this.\r\n\r\n'You ain't like your friend. Don't think I don't see that.'\r\n\r\n'Genevieve's a sweet girl,' said Katie, loyally.\r\n\r\n'A darned sight too sweet. Somebody ought to tell her mother.'\r\n\r\n'Why did you speak to her if you did not like her?'\r\n\r\n'Wanted to get to know you,' said the young man simply.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence. Katie's heart was beating with a rapidity\r\nthat forbade speech. Nothing like this very direct young man had ever\r\nhappened to her before. She had grown so accustomed to regarding\r\nherself as something too insignificant and unattractive for the notice\r\nof the lordly male that she was overwhelmed. She had a vague feeling\r\nthat there was a mistake somewhere. It surely could not be she who was\r\nproving so alluring to this fairy prince. The novelty of the situation\r\nfrightened her.\r\n\r\n'Come here often?' asked her companion.\r\n\r\n'I've never been here before.'\r\n\r\n'Often go to Coney?'\r\n\r\n'I've never been.'\r\n\r\nHe regarded her with astonishment.\r\n\r\n'You've never been to Coney Island! Why, you don't know what this sort\r\nof thing is till you've taken in Coney. This place isn't on the map\r\nwith Coney. Do you mean to say you've never seen Luna Park, or\r\nDreamland, or Steeplechase, or the diving ducks? Haven't you had a look\r\nat the Mardi Gras stunts? Why, Coney during Mardi Gras is the greatest\r\nthing on earth. It's a knockout. Just about a million boys and girls\r\nhaving the best time that ever was. Say, I guess you don't go out much,\r\ndo you?'\r\n\r\n'Not much.'\r\n\r\n'If it's not a rude question, what do you do? I been trying to place you\r\nall along. Now I reckon your friend works in a store, don't she?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. She's a cloak-model. She has a lovely figure, hasn't she?'\r\n\r\n'Didn't notice it. I guess so, if she's what you say. It's what they\r\npay her for, ain't it? Do you work in a store, too?'\r\n\r\n'Not exactly. I keep a little shop.'\r\n\r\n'All by yourself?'\r\n\r\n'I do all the work now. It was my father's shop, but he's dead. It\r\nbegan by being my grandfather's. He started it. But he's so old now\r\nthat, of course, he can't work any longer, so I look after things.'\r\n\r\n'Say, you're a wonder! What sort of a shop?'\r\n\r\n'It's only a little second-hand bookshop. There really isn't much to\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n'Where is it?'\r\n\r\n'Sixth Avenue. Near Washington Square.'\r\n\r\n'What name?'\r\n\r\n'Bennett.'\r\n\r\n'That's your name, then?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Anything besides Bennett?'\r\n\r\n'My name's Kate.'\r\n\r\nThe young man nodded.\r\n\r\n'I'd make a pretty good district attorney,' he said, disarming possible\r\nresentment at this cross-examination. 'I guess you're wondering if I'm\r\never going to stop asking you questions. Well, what would you like to\r\ndo?'\r\n\r\n'Don't you think we ought to go back and find your friend and\r\nGenevieve? They will be wondering where we are.'\r\n\r\n'Let 'em,' said the young man briefly. 'I've had all I want of Jenny.'\r\n\r\n'I can't understand why you don't like her.'\r\n\r\n'I like you. Shall we have some ice-cream, or would you rather go on\r\nthe Scenic Railway?'\r\n\r\nKatie decided on the more peaceful pleasure. They resumed their walk,\r\nsocially licking two cones. Out of the corner of her eyes Katie cast\r\nswift glances at her friend's face. He was a very grave young man.\r\nThere was something important as well as handsome about him. Once, as\r\nthey made their way through the crowds, she saw a couple of boys look\r\nalmost reverently at him. She wondered who he could be, but was too shy\r\nto inquire. She had got over her nervousness to a great extent, but\r\nthere were still limits to what she felt herself equal to saying. It\r\ndid not strike her that it was only fair that she should ask a few\r\nquestions in return for those which he had put. She had always\r\nrepressed herself, and she did so now. She was content to be with him\r\nwithout finding out his name and history.\r\n\r\nHe supplied the former just before he finally consented to let her go.\r\n\r\nThey were standing looking over the river. The sun had spent its force,\r\nand it was cool and pleasant in the breeze which was coming up the\r\nHudson. Katie was conscious of a vague feeling that was almost\r\nmelancholy. It had been a lovely afternoon, and she was sorry that it\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nThe young man shuffled his feet on the loose stones.\r\n\r\n'I'm mighty glad I met you,' he said. 'Say, I'm coming to see you. On\r\nSixth Avenue. Don't mind, do you?'\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for a reply.\r\n\r\n'Brady's my name. Ted Brady, Glencoe Athletic Club,' he paused. 'I'm on\r\nthe level,' he added, and paused again. 'I like you a whole lot. There's\r\nyour friend, Genevieve. Better go after her, hadn't you? Good-bye.' And\r\nhe was gone, walking swiftly through the crowd about the bandstand.\r\n\r\nKatie went back to Genevieve, and Genevieve was simply horrid. Cold and\r\nhaughty, a beautiful iceberg of dudgeon, she refused to speak a single\r\nword during the whole long journey back to Sixth Avenue. And Katie,\r\nwhose tender heart would at other times have been tortured by this\r\nhostility, leant back in her seat, and was happy. Her mind was far away\r\nfrom Genevieve's frozen gloom, living over again the wonderful\r\nhappenings of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nYes, it had been a wonderful afternoon, but trouble was waiting for her\r\nin Sixth Avenue. Trouble was never absent for very long from Katie's\r\nunselfish life. Arriving at the little bookshop, she found Mr Murdoch,\r\nthe glazier, preparing for departure. Mr Murdoch came in on Mondays,\r\nWednesdays, and Fridays to play draughts with her grandfather, who was\r\nparalysed from the waist, and unable to leave the house except when\r\nKatie took him for his outing in Washington Square each morning in his\r\nbath-chair.\r\n\r\nMr Murdoch welcomed Katie with joy.\r\n\r\n'I was wondering whenever you would come back, Katie. I'm afraid the\r\nold man's a little upset.'\r\n\r\n'Not ill?'\r\n\r\n'Not ill. Upset. And it was my fault, too. Thinking he'd be interested,\r\nI read him a piece from the paper where I seen about these English\r\nSuffragettes, and he just went up in the air. I guess he'll be all\r\nright now you've come back. I was a fool to read it, I reckon. I kind\r\nof forgot for the moment.'\r\n\r\n'Please don't worry yourself about it, Mr Murdoch. He'll be all right\r\nsoon. I'll go to him.'\r\n\r\nIn the inner room the old man was sitting. His face was flushed, and he\r\ngesticulated from time to time.\r\n\r\n'I won't have it,' he cried as Katie entered. 'I tell you I won't have\r\nit. If Parliament can't do anything, I'll send Parliament about its\r\nbusiness.'\r\n\r\n'Here I am, grandpapa,' said Katie quickly. 'I've had the greatest\r\ntime. It was lovely up there. I--'\r\n\r\n'I tell you it's got to stop. I've spoken about it before. I won't have\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'I expect they're doing their best. It's your being so far away that\r\nmakes it hard for them. But I do think you might write them a very\r\nsharp letter.'\r\n\r\n'I will. I will. Get out the paper. Are you ready?' He stopped, and\r\nlooked piteously at Katie. 'I don't know what to say. I don't know how\r\nto begin.'\r\n\r\nKatie scribbled a few lines.\r\n\r\n'How would this do? \"His Majesty informs his Government that he is\r\ngreatly surprised and indignant that no notice has been taken of his\r\nprevious communications. If this goes on, he will be reluctantly\r\ncompelled to put the matter in other hands.\"'\r\n\r\nShe read it glibly as she had written it. The formula had been a\r\nfavourite one of her late father, when roused to fall upon offending\r\npatrons of the bookshop.\r\n\r\nThe old man beamed. His resentment was gone. He was soothed and happy.\r\n\r\n'That'll wake 'em up,' he said. 'I won't have these goings on while I'm\r\nking, and if they don't like it, they know what to do. You're a good\r\ngirl, Katie.'\r\n\r\nHe chuckled.\r\n\r\n'I beat Lord Murdoch five games to nothing,' he said.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly two years since the morning when old Matthew Bennett\r\nhad announced to an audience consisting of Katie and a smoky blue cat,\r\nwhich had wandered in from Washington Square to take pot-luck, that he\r\nwas the King of England.\r\n\r\nThis was a long time for any one delusion of the old man's to last.\r\nUsually they came and went with a rapidity which made it hard for\r\nKatie, for all her tact, to keep abreast of them. She was not likely to\r\nforget the time when he went to bed President Roosevelt and woke up the\r\nProphet Elijah. It was the only occasion in all the years they had\r\npassed together when she had felt like giving way and indulging in the\r\nfit of hysterics which most girls of her age would have had as a matter\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nShe had handled that crisis, and she handled the present one with equal\r\nsmoothness. When her grandfather made his announcement, which he did\r\nrather as one stating a generally recognized fact than as if the\r\ninformation were in any way sensational, she neither screamed nor\r\nswooned, nor did she rush to the neighbours for advice. She merely gave\r\nthe old man his breakfast, not forgetting to set aside a suitable\r\nportion for the smoky cat, and then went round to notify Mr Murdoch of\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\nMr Murdoch, excellent man, received the news without any fuss or\r\nexcitement at all, and promised to look in on Schwartz, the stout\r\nsaloon-keeper, who was Mr Bennett's companion and antagonist at\r\ndraughts on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and, as he expressed\r\nit, put him wise.\r\n\r\nLife ran comfortably in the new groove. Old Mr Bennett continued to\r\nplay draughts and pore over his second-hand classics. Every morning he\r\ntook his outing in Washington Square where, from his invalid's chair,\r\nhe surveyed somnolent Italians and roller-skating children with his old\r\nair of kindly approval. Katie, whom circumstances had taught to be\r\nthankful for small mercies, was perfectly happy in the shadow of the\r\nthrone. She liked her work; she liked looking after her grandfather;\r\nand now that Ted Brady had come into her life, she really began to look\r\non herself as an exceptionally lucky girl, a spoilt favourite of\r\nFortune.\r\n\r\nFor Ted Brady had called, as he said he would, and from the very first\r\nhe had made plain in his grave, direct way the objects of his visits.\r\nThere was no subtlety about Ted, no finesse. He was as frank as a\r\nmusic-hall love song.\r\n\r\nOn his first visit, having handed Katie a large bunch of roses with the\r\nstolidity of a messenger boy handing over a parcel, he had proceeded,\r\nby way of establishing his _bona fides_, to tell her all about\r\nhimself. He supplied the facts in no settled order, just as they\r\nhappened to occur to him in the long silences with which his speech was\r\npunctuated. Small facts jostled large facts. He spoke of his morals and\r\nhis fox-terrier in the same breath.\r\n\r\n'I'm on the level. Ask anyone who knows me. They'll tell you that. Say,\r\nI got the cutest little dog you ever seen. Do you like dogs? I've never\r\nbeen a fellow that's got himself mixed up with girls. I don't like 'em\r\nas a general thing. A fellow's got too much to do keeping himself in\r\ntraining, if his club expects him to do things. I belong to the Glencoe\r\nAthletic. I ran the hundred yards dash in evens last sports there was.\r\nThey expect me to do it at the Glencoe, so I've never got myself mixed\r\nup with girls. Till I seen you that afternoon I reckon I'd hardly\r\nlooked at a girl, honest. They didn't seem to kind of make any hit with\r\nme. And then I seen you, and I says to myself, \"That's the one.\" It\r\nsort of came over me in a flash. I fell for you directly I seen you.\r\nAnd I'm on the level. Don't forget that.'\r\n\r\nAnd more in the same strain, leaning on the counter and looking into\r\nKatie's eyes with a devotion that added emphasis to his measured\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nNext day he came again, and kissed her respectfully but firmly, making\r\na sort of shuffling dive across the counter. Breaking away, he fumbled\r\nin his pocket and produced a ring, which he proceeded to place on her\r\nfinger with the serious air which accompanied all his actions.\r\n\r\n'That looks pretty good to me,' he said, as he stepped back and eyed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt struck Katie, when he had gone, how differently different men did\r\nthings. Genevieve had often related stories of men who had proposed to\r\nher, and according to Genevieve, they always got excited and emotional,\r\nand sometimes cried. Ted Brady had fitted her with the ring more like a\r\nglover's assistant than anything else, and he had hardly spoken a word\r\nfrom beginning to end. He had seemed to take her acquiescence for\r\ngranted. And yet there had been nothing flat or disappointing about the\r\nproceedings. She had been thrilled throughout. It is to be supposed\r\nthat Mr Brady had the force of character which does not require the aid\r\nof speech.\r\n\r\nIt was not till she took the news of her engagement to old Mr Bennett\r\nthat it was borne in upon Katie that Fate did not intend to be so\r\nwholly benevolent to her as she supposed.\r\n\r\nThat her grandfather could offer any opposition had not occurred to her\r\nas a possibility. She took his approval for granted. Never, as long as\r\nshe could remember, had he been anything but kind to her. And the only\r\npossible objections to marriage from a grandfather's point of\r\nview--badness of character, insufficient means, or inferiority of\r\nsocial position--were in this case gloriously absent.\r\n\r\nShe could not see how anyone, however hypercritical, could find a flaw\r\nin Ted. His character was spotless. He was comfortably off. And so far\r\nfrom being in any way inferior socially, it was he who condescended.\r\nFor Ted, she had discovered from conversation with Mr Murdoch, the\r\nglazier, was no ordinary young man. He was a celebrity. So much so that\r\nfor a moment, when told the news of the engagement, Mr Murdoch,\r\nstartled out of his usual tact, had exhibited frank surprise that the\r\ngreat Ted Brady should not have aimed higher.\r\n\r\n'You're sure you've got the name right, Katie?' he had said. 'It's\r\nreally Ted Brady? No mistake about the first name? Well-built,\r\ngood-looking young chap with brown eyes? Well, this beats me. Not,' he\r\nwent on hurriedly, 'that any young fellow mightn't think himself lucky\r\nto get a wife like you, Katie, but Ted Brady! Why, there isn't a girl\r\nin this part of the town, or in Harlem or the Bronx, for that matter,\r\nwho wouldn't give her eyes to be in your place. Why, Ted Brady is the\r\nbig noise. He's the star of the Glencoe.'\r\n\r\n'He told me he belonged to the Glencoe Athletic.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you believe it. It belongs to him. Why, the way that boy runs\r\nand jumps is the real limit. There's only Billy Burton, of the\r\nIrish-American, that can touch him. You've certainly got the pick of\r\nthe bunch, Katie.'\r\n\r\nHe stared at her admiringly, as if for the first time realizing her\r\ntrue worth. For Mr Murdoch was a great patron of sport.\r\n\r\nWith these facts in her possession Katie had approached the interview\r\nwith her grandfather with a good deal of confidence.\r\n\r\nThe old man listened to her recital of Mr Brady's qualities in silence.\r\nThen he shook his head.\r\n\r\n'It can't be, Katie. I couldn't have it.'\r\n\r\n'Grandpapa!'\r\n\r\n'You're forgetting, my dear.'\r\n\r\n'Forgetting?'\r\n\r\n'Who ever heard of such a thing? The grand-daughter of the King of\r\nEngland marrying a commoner! It wouldn't do at all.'\r\n\r\nConsternation, surprise, and misery kept Katie dumb. She had learned in\r\na hard school to be prepared for sudden blows from the hand of fate,\r\nbut this one was so entirely unforeseen that it found her unprepared,\r\nand she was crushed by it. She knew her grandfather's obstinacy too\r\nwell to argue against the decision.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, not at all,' he repeated. 'Oh, no, it wouldn't do.'\r\n\r\nKatie said nothing; she was beyond speech. She stood there wide-eyed\r\nand silent among the ruins of her little air-castle. The old man patted\r\nher hand affectionately. He was pleased at her docility. It was the\r\nright attitude, becoming in one of her high rank.\r\n\r\n'I am very sorry, my dear, but--oh, no! oh, no! oh, no--' His voice\r\ntrailed away into an unintelligible mutter. He was a very old man, and\r\nhe was not always able to concentrate his thoughts on a subject for any\r\nlength of time.\r\n\r\nSo little did Ted Brady realize at first the true complexity of the\r\nsituation that he was inclined, when he heard of the news, to treat the\r\ncrisis in the jaunty, dashing, love-laughs-at-locksmith fashion so\r\npopular with young men of spirit when thwarted in their loves by the\r\ninterference of parents and guardians.\r\n\r\nIt took Katie some time to convince him that, just because he had the\r\nlicence in his pocket, he could not snatch her up on his saddle-bow and\r\ncarry her off to the nearest clergyman after the manner of young\r\nLochinvar.\r\n\r\nIn the first flush of his resentment at restraint he saw no reason why\r\nhe should differentiate between old Mr Bennett and the conventional\r\nbanns-forbidding father of the novelettes with which he was accustomed\r\nto sweeten his hours of idleness. To him, till Katie explained the\r\nintricacies of the position, Mr Bennett was simply the proud\r\nmillionaire who would not hear of his daughter marrying the artist.\r\n\r\n'But, Ted, dear, you don't understand,' Katie said. 'We simply couldn't\r\ndo that. There's no one but me to look after him, poor old man. How\r\ncould I run away like that and get married? What would become of him?'\r\n\r\n'You wouldn't be away long,' urged Mr Brady, a man of many parts, but\r\nnot a rapid thinker. 'The minister would have us fixed up inside of\r\nhalf an hour. Then we'd look in at Mouquin's for a steak and fried,\r\njust to make a sort of wedding breakfast. And then back we'd come,\r\nhand-in-hand, and say, \"Well, here we are. Now what?\"'\r\n\r\n'He would never forgive me.'\r\n\r\n'That,' said Ted judicially, 'would be up to him.'\r\n\r\n'It would kill him. Don't you see, we know that it's all nonsense, this\r\nidea of his; but he really thinks he is the king, and he's so old that\r\nthe shock of my disobeying him would be too much. Honest, Ted, dear, I\r\ncouldn't.'\r\n\r\nGloom unutterable darkened Ted Brady's always serious countenance. The\r\ndifficulties of the situation were beginning to come home to him.\r\n\r\n'Maybe if I went and saw him--' he suggested at last.\r\n\r\n'You _could_,' said Katie doubtfully.\r\n\r\nTed tightened his belt with an air of determination, and bit resolutely\r\non the chewing-gum which was his inseparable companion.\r\n\r\n'I will,' he said.\r\n\r\n'You'll be nice to him, Ted?'\r\n\r\nHe nodded. He was the man of action, not words.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps ten minutes before he came out of the inner room in\r\nwhich Mr Bennett passed his days. When he did, there was no light of\r\njubilation on his face. His brow was darker than ever.\r\n\r\nKatie looked at him anxiously. He returned the look with a sombre shake\r\nof the head.\r\n\r\n'Nothing doing,' he said shortly. He paused. 'Unless,' he added, 'you\r\ncount it anything that he's made me an earl.'\r\n\r\nIn the next two weeks several brains busied themselves with the\r\nsituation. Genevieve, reconciled to Katie after a decent interval of\r\nwounded dignity, said she supposed there was a way out, if one could\r\nonly think of it, but it certainly got past her. The only approach to a\r\nplan of action was suggested by the broken-nosed individual who had\r\nbeen Ted's companion that day at Palisades Park, a gentleman of some\r\neminence in the boxing world, who rejoiced in the name of the Tennessee\r\nBear-Cat.\r\n\r\nWhat they ought to do, in the Bear-Cat's opinion, was to get the old\r\nman out into Washington Square one morning. He of Tennessee would then\r\nsasshay up in a flip manner and make a break. Ted, waiting close by,\r\nwould resent his insolence. There would be words, followed by blows.\r\n\r\n'See what I mean?' pursued the Bear-Cat. 'There's you and me mixing it.\r\nI'll square the cop on the beat to leave us be; he's a friend of mine.\r\nPretty soon you land me one on the plexus, and I take th' count. Then\r\nthere's you hauling me up by th' collar to the old gentleman, and me\r\nsaying I quits and apologizing. See what I mean?'\r\n\r\nThe whole, presumably, to conclude with warm expressions of gratitude\r\nand esteem from Mr Bennett, and an instant withdrawal of the veto.\r\n\r\nTed himself approved of the scheme. He said it was a cracker-jaw, and\r\nhe wondered how one so notoriously ivory-skulled as the other could\r\nhave had such an idea. The Bear-Cat said modestly that he had 'em\r\nsometimes. And it is probable that all would have been well, had it not\r\nbeen necessary to tell the plan to Katie, who was horrified at the very\r\nidea, spoke warmly of the danger to her grandfather's nervous system,\r\nand said she did not think the Bear-Cat could be a nice friend for Ted.\r\nAnd matters relapsed into their old state of hopelessness.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one day, Katie forced herself to tell Ted that she thought it\r\nwould be better if they did not see each other for a time. She said\r\nthat these meetings were only a source of pain to both of them. It\r\nwould really be better if he did not come round for--well, quite some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt had not been easy for her to say it. The decision was the outcome of\r\nmany wakeful nights. She had asked herself the question whether it was\r\nfair for her to keep Ted chained to her in this hopeless fashion, when,\r\nleft to himself and away from her, he might so easily find some other\r\ngirl to make him happy.\r\n\r\nSo Ted went, reluctantly, and the little shop on Sixth Avenue knew him\r\nno more. And Katie spent her time looking after old Mr Bennett (who had\r\ncompletely forgotten the affair by now, and sometimes wondered why\r\nKatie was not so cheerful as she had been), and--for, though unselfish,\r\nshe was human--hating those unknown girls whom in her mind's eye she\r\ncould see clustering round Ted, smiling at him, making much of him, and\r\ndriving the bare recollection of her out of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe summer passed. July came and went, making New York an oven. August\r\nfollowed, and one wondered why one had complained of July's tepid\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening of September the eleventh that Katie, having\r\nclosed the little shop, sat in the dusk on the steps, as many thousands\r\nof her fellow-townsmen and townswomen were doing, turning her face to\r\nthe first breeze which New York had known for two months. The hot spell\r\nhad broken abruptly that afternoon, and the city was drinking in the\r\ncoolness as a flower drinks water.\r\n\r\nFrom round the corner, where the yellow cross of the Judson Hotel shone\r\ndown on Washington Square, came the shouts of children, and the\r\nstrains, mellowed by distance, of the indefatigable barrel-organ which\r\nhad played the same tunes in the same place since the spring.\r\n\r\nKatie closed her eyes, and listened. It was very peaceful this evening,\r\nso peaceful that for an instant she forgot even to think of Ted. And it\r\nwas just during this instant that she heard his voice.\r\n\r\n'That you, kid?'\r\n\r\nHe was standing before her, his hands in his pockets, one foot on the\r\npavement, the other in the road; and if he was agitated, his voice did\r\nnot show it.\r\n\r\n'Ted!'\r\n\r\n'That's me. Can I see the old man for a minute, Katie?'\r\n\r\nThis time it did seem to her that she could detect a slight ring of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n'It's no use, Ted. Honest.'\r\n\r\n'No harm in going in and passing the time of day, is there? I've got\r\nsomething I want to say to him.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'Tell you later, maybe. Is he in his room?'\r\n\r\nHe stepped past her, and went in. As he went, he caught her arm and\r\npressed it, but he did not stop. She saw him go into the inner room and\r\nheard through the door as he closed it behind him, the murmur of\r\nvoices. And almost immediately, it seemed to her, her name was called.\r\nIt was her grandfather's voice which called, high and excited. The door\r\nopened, and Ted appeared.\r\n\r\n'Come here a minute, Katie, will you?' he said. 'You're wanted.'\r\n\r\nThe old man was leaning forward in his chair. He was in a state of\r\nextraordinary excitement. He quivered and jumped. Ted, standing by the\r\nwall, looked as stolid as ever; but his eyes glittered.\r\n\r\n'Katie,' cried the old man, 'this is a most remarkable piece of news.\r\nThis gentleman has just been telling me--extraordinary. He--'\r\n\r\nHe broke off, and looked at Ted, as he had looked at Katie when he had\r\ntried to write the letter to the Parliament of England.\r\n\r\nTed's eye, as it met Katie's, was almost defiant.\r\n\r\n'I want to marry you,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes,' broke in Mr Bennett, impatiently, 'but--'\r\n\r\n'And I'm a king.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, that's it, that's it, Katie. This gentleman is a king.'\r\n\r\nOnce more Ted's eye met Katie's, and this time there was an imploring\r\nlook in it.\r\n\r\n'That's right,' he said, slowly. 'I've just been telling your\r\ngrandfather I'm the King of Coney Island.'\r\n\r\n'That's it. Of Coney Island.'\r\n\r\n'So there's no objection now to us getting married, kid--Your Royal\r\nHighness. It's a royal alliance, see?'\r\n\r\n'A royal alliance,' echoed Mr Bennett.\r\n\r\nOut in the street, Ted held Katie's hand, and grinned a little\r\nsheepishly.\r\n\r\n'You're mighty quiet, kid,' he said. 'It looks as if it don't make much\r\nof a hit with you, the notion of being married to me.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Ted! But--'\r\n\r\nHe squeezed her hand.\r\n\r\n'I know what you're thinking. I guess it was raw work pulling a tale\r\nlike that on the old man. I hated to do it, but gee! when a fellow's up\r\nagainst it like I was, he's apt to grab most any chance that comes\r\nalong. Why, say, kid, it kind of looked to me as if it was sort of\r\n_meant_. Coming just now, like it did, just when it was wanted,\r\nand just when it didn't seem possible it could happen. Why, a week ago\r\nI was nigh on two hundred votes behind Billy Burton. The Irish-American\r\nput him up, and everybody thought he'd be King at the Mardi Gras. And\r\nthen suddenly they came pouring in for me, till at the finish I had\r\nBilly looking like a regular has-been.\r\n\r\n'It's funny the way the voting jumps about every year in this Coney\r\nelection. It was just Providence, and it didn't seem right to let it go\r\nby. So I went in to the old man, and told him. Say, I tell you I was\r\njust sweating when I got ready to hand it to him. It was an outside\r\nchance he'd remember all about what the Mardi Gras at Coney was, and\r\njust what being a king at it amounted to. Then I remembered you telling\r\nme you'd never been to Coney, so I figured your grandfather wouldn't be\r\nwhat you'd call well fixed in his information about it, so I took the\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n'I tried him out first. I tried him with Brooklyn. Why, say, from the\r\nway he took it, he'd either never heard of the place, or else he'd\r\nforgotten what it was. I guess he don't remember much, poor old fellow.\r\nThen I mentioned Yonkers. He asked me what Yonkers were. Then I\r\nreckoned it was safe to bring on Coney, and he fell for it right away.\r\nI felt mean, but it had to be done.'\r\n\r\nHe caught her up, and swung her into the air with a perfectly impassive\r\nface. Then, having kissed her, he lowered her gently to the ground\r\nagain. The action seemed to have relieved his feelings, for when he\r\nspoke again it was plain that his conscience no longer troubled him.\r\n\r\n'And say,' he said, 'come to think of it, I don't see where there's so\r\nmuch call for me to feel mean. I'm not so far short of being a regular\r\nking. Coney's just as big as some of those kingdoms you read about on\r\nthe other side; and, from what you see in the papers about the\r\ngoings-on there, it looks to me that, having a whole week on the throne\r\nlike I'm going to have, amounts to a pretty steady job as kings go.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT GEISENHEIMER'S\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I walked to Geisenheimer's that night I was feeling blue and\r\nrestless, tired of New York, tired of dancing, tired of everything.\r\nBroadway was full of people hurrying to the theatres. Cars rattled by.\r\nAll the electric lights in the world were blazing down on the Great\r\nWhite Way. And it all seemed stale and dreary to me.\r\n\r\nGeisenheimer's was full as usual. All the tables were occupied, and\r\nthere were several couples already on the dancing-floor in the centre.\r\nThe band was playing 'Michigan':\r\n\r\n     _I want to go back, I want to go back\r\n     To the place where I was born.\r\n     Far away from harm\r\n     With a milk-pail on my arm._\r\n\r\nI suppose the fellow who wrote that would have called for the police if\r\nanyone had ever really tried to get him on to a farm, but he has\r\ncertainly put something into the tune which makes you think he meant\r\nwhat he said. It's a homesick tune, that.\r\n\r\nI was just looking round for an empty table, when a man jumped up and\r\ncame towards me, registering joy as if I had been his long-lost sister.\r\n\r\nHe was from the country. I could see that. It was written all over him,\r\nfrom his face to his shoes.\r\n\r\nHe came up with his hand out, beaming.\r\n\r\n'Why, Miss Roxborough!'\r\n\r\n'Why not?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Don't you remember me?'\r\n\r\nI didn't.\r\n\r\n'My name is Ferris.'\r\n\r\n'It's a nice name, but it means nothing in my young life.'\r\n\r\n'I was introduced to you last time I came here. We danced together.'\r\n\r\nThis seemed to bear the stamp of truth. If he was introduced to me, he\r\nprobably danced with me. It's what I'm at Geisenheimer's for.\r\n\r\n'When was it?'\r\n\r\n'A year ago last April.'\r\n\r\nYou can't beat these rural charmers. They think New York is folded up\r\nand put away in camphor when they leave, and only taken out again when\r\nthey pay their next visit. The notion that anything could possibly have\r\nhappened since he was last in our midst to blur the memory of that\r\nhappy evening had not occurred to Mr Ferris. I suppose he was so\r\naccustomed to dating things from 'when I was in New York' that he\r\nthought everybody else must do the same.\r\n\r\n'Why, sure, I remember you,' I said. 'Algernon Clarence, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Not Algernon Clarence. My name's Charlie.'\r\n\r\n'My mistake. And what's the great scheme, Mr Ferris? Do you want to\r\ndance with me again?'\r\n\r\nHe did. So we started. Mine not to reason why, mine but to do and die,\r\nas the poem says. If an elephant had come into Geisenheimer's and asked\r\nme to dance I'd have had to do it. And I'm not saying that Mr Ferris\r\nwasn't the next thing to it. He was one of those earnest, persevering\r\ndancers--the kind that have taken twelve correspondence lessons.\r\n\r\nI guess I was about due that night to meet someone from the country.\r\nThere still come days in the spring when the country seems to get a\r\nstranglehold on me and start in pulling. This particular day had been\r\none of them. I got up in the morning and looked out of the window, and\r\nthe breeze just wrapped me round and began whispering about pigs and\r\nchickens. And when I went out on Fifth Avenue there seemed to be\r\nflowers everywhere. I headed for the Park, and there was the grass all\r\ngreen, and the trees coming out, and a sort of something in the\r\nair--why, say, if there hadn't have been a big policeman keeping an eye\r\non me, I'd have flung myself down and bitten chunks out of the turf.\r\n\r\nAnd as soon as I got to Geisenheimer's they played that 'Michigan'\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nWhy, Charlie from Squeedunk's 'entrance' couldn't have been better\r\nworked up if he'd been a star in a Broadway show. The stage was just\r\nwaiting for him.\r\n\r\nBut somebody's always taking the joy out of life. I ought to have\r\nremembered that the most metropolitan thing in the metropolis is a\r\nrustic who's putting in a week there. We weren't thinking on the same\r\nplane, Charlie and me. The way I had been feeling all day, what I\r\nwanted to talk about was last season's crops. The subject he fancied\r\nwas this season's chorus-girls. Our souls didn't touch by a mile and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n'This is the life!' he said.\r\n\r\nThere's always a point when that sort of man says that.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you come here quite a lot?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Pretty often.'\r\n\r\nI didn't tell him that I came there every night, and that I came\r\nbecause I was paid for it. If you're a professional dancer at\r\nGeisenheimer's, you aren't supposed to advertise the fact. The\r\nmanagement thinks that if you did it might send the public away\r\nthinking too hard when they saw you win the Great Contest for the\r\nLove-r-ly Silver Cup which they offer later in the evening. Say, that\r\nLove-r-ly Cup's a joke. I win it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,\r\nand Mabel Francis wins it on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. It's\r\nall perfectly fair and square, of course. It's purely a matter of merit\r\nwho wins the Love-r-ly Cup. Anybody could win it. Only somehow they\r\ndon't. And the coincidence of the fact that Mabel and I always do has\r\nkind of got on the management's nerves, and they don't like us to tell\r\npeople we're employed there. They prefer us to blush unseen.\r\n\r\n'It's a great place,' said Mr Ferris, 'and New York's a great place.\r\nI'd like to live in New York.'\r\n\r\n'The loss is ours. Why don't you?'\r\n\r\n'Some city! But dad's dead now, and I've got the drugstore, you know.'\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if I ought to remember reading about it in the papers.\r\n\r\n'And I'm making good with it, what's more. I've got push and ideas.\r\nSay, I got married since I saw you last.'\r\n\r\n'You did, did you?' I said. 'Then what are you doing, may I ask,\r\ndancing on Broadway like a gay bachelor? I suppose you have left your\r\nwife at Hicks' Corners, singing \"Where is my wandering boy tonight\"?'\r\n\r\n'Not Hicks' Corners. Ashley, Maine. That's where I live. My wife comes\r\nfrom Rodney.... Pardon me, I'm afraid I stepped on your foot.'\r\n\r\n'My fault,' I said; 'I lost step. Well, I wonder you aren't ashamed\r\neven to think of your wife, when you've left her all alone out there\r\nwhile you come whooping it up in New York. Haven't you got any\r\nconscience?'\r\n\r\n'But I haven't left her. She's here.'\r\n\r\n'In New York?'\r\n\r\n'In this restaurant. That's her up there.'\r\n\r\nI looked up at the balcony. There was a face hanging over the red plush\r\nrail. It looked to me as if it had some hidden sorrow. I'd noticed it\r\nbefore, when we were dancing around, and I had wondered what the\r\ntrouble was. Now I began to see.\r\n\r\n'Why aren't you dancing with her and giving her a good time, then?' I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n'Oh, she's having a good time.'\r\n\r\n'She doesn't look it. She looks as if she would like to be down here,\r\ntreading the measure.'\r\n\r\n'She doesn't dance much.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you have dances at Ashley?'\r\n\r\n'It's different at home. She dances well enough for Ashley, but--well,\r\nthis isn't Ashley.'\r\n\r\n'I see. But you're not like that?'\r\n\r\nHe gave a kind of smirk.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I've been in New York before.'\r\n\r\nI could have bitten him, the sawn-off little rube! It made me mad. He\r\nwas ashamed to dance in public with his wife--didn't think her good\r\nenough for him. So he had dumped her in a chair, given her a lemonade,\r\nand told her to be good, and then gone off to have a good time. They\r\ncould have had me arrested for what I was thinking just then.\r\n\r\nThe band began to play something else.\r\n\r\n'This is the life!' said Mr Ferris. 'Let's do it again.'\r\n\r\n'Let somebody else do it,' I said. 'I'm tired. I'll introduce you to\r\nsome friends of mine.'\r\n\r\nSo I took him off, and whisked him on to some girls I knew at one of\r\nthe tables.\r\n\r\n'Shake hands with my friend Mr Ferris,' I said. 'He wants to show you\r\nthe latest steps. He does most of them on your feet.'\r\n\r\nI could have betted on Charlie, the Debonair Pride of Ashley. Guess\r\nwhat he said? He said, 'This is the life!'\r\n\r\nAnd I left him, and went up to the balcony.\r\n\r\nShe was leaning with her elbows on the red plush, looking down on the\r\ndancing-floor. They had just started another tune, and hubby was moving\r\naround with one of the girls I'd introduced him to. She didn't have to\r\nprove to me that she came from the country. I knew it. She was a little\r\nbit of a thing, old-fashioned looking. She was dressed in grey, with\r\nwhite muslin collar and cuffs, and her hair done simple. She had a\r\nblack hat.\r\n\r\nI kind of hovered for awhile. It isn't the best thing I do, being shy;\r\nas a general thing I'm more or less there with the nerve; but somehow I\r\nsort of hesitated to charge in.\r\n\r\nThen I braced up, and made for the vacant chair.\r\n\r\n'I'll sit here, if you don't mind,' I said.\r\n\r\nShe turned in a startled way. I could see she was wondering who I was,\r\nand what right I had there, but wasn't certain whether it might not be\r\ncity etiquette for strangers to come and dump themselves down and start\r\nchatting. 'I've just been dancing with your husband,' I said, to ease\r\nthings along.\r\n\r\n'I saw you.'\r\n\r\nShe fixed me with a pair of big brown eyes. I took one look at them,\r\nand then I had to tell myself that it might be pleasant, and a relief\r\nto my feelings, to take something solid and heavy and drop it over the\r\nrail on to hubby, but the management wouldn't like it. That was how I\r\nfelt about him just then. The poor kid was doing everything with those\r\neyes except crying. She looked like a dog that's been kicked.\r\n\r\nShe looked away, and fiddled with the string of the electric light.\r\nThere was a hatpin lying on the table. She picked it up, and began to\r\ndig at the red plush.\r\n\r\n'Ah, come on sis,' I said; 'tell me all about it.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know what you mean.'\r\n\r\n'You can't fool me. Tell me your troubles.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know you.'\r\n\r\n'You don't have to know a person to tell her your troubles. I sometimes\r\ntell mine to the cat that camps out on the wall opposite my room. What\r\ndid you want to leave the country for, with summer coming on?'\r\n\r\nShe didn't answer, but I could see it coming, so I sat still and\r\nwaited. And presently she seemed to make up her mind that, even if it\r\nwas no business of mine, it would be a relief to talk about it.\r\n\r\n'We're on our honeymoon. Charlie wanted to come to New York. I didn't\r\nwant to, but he was set on it. He's been here before.'\r\n\r\n'So he told me.'\r\n\r\n'He's wild about New York.'\r\n\r\n'But you're not.'\r\n\r\n'I hate it.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\nShe dug away at the red plush with the hatpin, picking out little bits\r\nand dropping them over the edge. I could see she was bracing herself to\r\nput me wise to the whole trouble. There's a time comes when things\r\naren't going right, and you've had all you can stand, when you have got\r\nto tell somebody about it, no matter who it is.\r\n\r\n'I hate New York,' she said getting it out at last with a rush. 'I'm\r\nscared of it. It--it isn't fair Charlie bringing me here. I didn't want\r\nto come. I knew what would happen. I felt it all along.'\r\n\r\n'What do you think will happen, then?'\r\n\r\nShe must have picked away at least an inch of the red plush before she\r\nanswered. It's lucky Jimmy, the balcony waiter, didn't see her; it\r\nwould have broken his heart; he's as proud of that red plush as if he\r\nhad paid for it himself.\r\n\r\n'When I first went to live at Rodney,' she said, 'two years ago--we\r\nmoved there from Illinois--there was a man there named Tyson--Jack\r\nTyson. He lived all alone and didn't seem to want to know anyone. I\r\ncouldn't understand it till somebody told me all about him. I can\r\nunderstand it now. Jack Tyson married a Rodney girl, and they came to\r\nNew York for their honeymoon, just like us. And when they got there I\r\nguess she got to comparing him with the fellows she saw, and comparing\r\nthe city with Rodney, and when she got home she just couldn't settle\r\ndown.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'After they had been back in Rodney for a little while she ran away.\r\nBack to the city, I guess.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose he got a divorce?'\r\n\r\n'No, he didn't. He still thinks she may come back to him.'\r\n\r\n'He still thinks she will come back?' I said. 'After she has been away\r\nthree years!'\r\n\r\n'Yes. He keeps her things just the same as she left them when she went\r\naway, everything just the same.'\r\n\r\n'But isn't he angry with her for what she did? If I was a man and a\r\ngirl treated me that way, I'd be apt to murder her if she tried to show\r\nup again.'\r\n\r\n'He wouldn't. Nor would I, if--if anything like that happened to me;\r\nI'd wait and wait, and go on hoping all the time. And I'd go down to\r\nthe station to meet the train every afternoon, just like Jack Tyson.'\r\n\r\nSomething splashed on the tablecloth. It made me jump.\r\n\r\n'For goodness' sake,' I said, 'what's your trouble? Brace up. I know\r\nit's a sad story, but it's not your funeral.'\r\n\r\n'It is. It is. The same thing's going to happen to me.'\r\n\r\n'Take a hold on yourself. Don't cry like that.'\r\n\r\n'I can't help it. Oh! I knew it would happen. It's happening right now.\r\nLook--look at him.'\r\n\r\nI glanced over the rail, and I saw what she meant. There was her\r\nCharlie, dancing about all over the floor as if he had just discovered\r\nthat he hadn't lived till then. I saw him say something to the girl he\r\nwas dancing with. I wasn't near enough to hear it, but I bet it was\r\n'This is the life!' If I had been his wife, in the same position as\r\nthis kid, I guess I'd have felt as bad as she did, for if ever a man\r\nexhibited all the symptoms of incurable Newyorkitis, it was this\r\nCharlie Ferris.\r\n\r\n'I'm not like these New York girls,' she choked. 'I can't be smart. I\r\ndon't want to be. I just want to live at home and be happy. I knew it\r\nwould happen if we came to the city. He doesn't think me good enough\r\nfor him. He looks down on me.'\r\n\r\n'Pull yourself together.'\r\n\r\n'And I do love him so!'\r\n\r\nGoodness knows what I should have said if I could have thought of\r\nanything to say. But just then the music stopped, and somebody on the\r\nfloor below began to speak.\r\n\r\n'Ladeez 'n' gemmen,' he said, 'there will now take place our great\r\nNumbah Contest. This gen-u-ine sporting contest--'\r\n\r\nIt was Izzy Baermann making his nightly speech, introducing the\r\nLove-r-ly Cup; and it meant that, for me, duty called. From where I sat\r\nI could see Izzy looking about the room, and I knew he was looking for\r\nme. It's the management's nightmare that one of these evenings Mabel or\r\nI won't show up, and somebody else will get away with the Love-r-ly\r\nCup.\r\n\r\n'Sorry I've got to go,' I said. 'I have to be in this.'\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly I had the great idea. It came to me like a flash, I\r\nlooked at her, crying there, and I looked over the rail at Charlie the\r\nBoy Wonder, and I knew that this was where I got a stranglehold on my\r\nplace in the Hall of Fame, along with the great thinkers of the age.\r\n\r\n'Come on,' I said. 'Come along. Stop crying and powder your nose and\r\nget a move on. You're going to dance this.'\r\n\r\n'But Charlie doesn't want to dance with me.'\r\n\r\n'It may have escaped your notice,' I said, 'but your Charlie is not the\r\nonly man in New York, or even in this restaurant. I'm going to dance\r\nwith Charlie myself, and I'll introduce you to someone who can go\r\nthrough the movements. Listen!'\r\n\r\n'The lady of each couple'--this was Izzy, getting it off his\r\ndiaphragm--'will receive a ticket containing a num-bah. The dance will\r\nthen proceed, and the num-bahs will be eliminated one by one, those\r\ncalled out by the judge kindly returning to their seats as their\r\nnum-bah is called. The num-bah finally remaining is the winning\r\nnum-bah. The contest is a genuine sporting contest, decided purely by\r\nthe skill of the holders of the various num-bahs.' (Izzy stopped\r\nblushing at the age of six.) 'Will ladies now kindly step forward and\r\nreceive their num-bahs. The winner, the holder of the num-bah left on\r\nthe floor when the other num-bahs have been eliminated' (I could see\r\nIzzy getting more and more uneasy, wondering where on earth I'd got\r\nto), 'will receive this Love-r-ly Silver Cup, presented by the\r\nmanagement. Ladies will now kindly step forward and receive their\r\nnum-bahs.'\r\n\r\nI turned to Mrs Charlie. 'There,' I said, 'don't you want to win a\r\nLove-r-ly Silver Cup?'\r\n\r\n'But I couldn't.'\r\n\r\n'You never know your luck.'\r\n\r\n'But it isn't luck. Didn't you hear him say it's a contest decided\r\npurely by skill?'\r\n\r\n'Well, try your skill, then.' I felt as if I could have shaken her.\r\n'For goodness' sake,' I said, 'show a little grit. Aren't you going to\r\nstir a finger to keep your Charlie? Suppose you win, think what it will\r\nmean. He will look up to you for the rest of your life. When he starts\r\ntalking about New York, all you will have to say is, \"New York? Ah,\r\nyes, that was the town I won that Love-r-ly Silver Cup in, was it not?\"\r\nand he'll drop as if you had hit him behind the ear with a sandbag.\r\nPull yourself together and try.'\r\n\r\nI saw those brown eyes of hers flash, and she said, 'I'll try.'\r\n\r\n'Good for you,' I said. 'Now you get those tears dried, and fix\r\nyourself up, and I'll go down and get the tickets.'\r\n\r\nIzzy was mighty relieved when I bore down on him.\r\n\r\n'Gee!' he said, 'I thought you had run away, or was sick or something.\r\nHere's your ticket.'\r\n\r\n'I want two, Izzy. One's for a friend of mine. And I say, Izzy, I'd\r\ntake it as a personal favour if you would let her stop on the floor as\r\none of the last two couples. There's a reason. She's a kid from the\r\ncountry, and she wants to make a hit.'\r\n\r\n'Sure, that'll be all right. Here are the tickets. Yours is thirty-six,\r\nhers is ten.' He lowered his voice. 'Don't go mixing them.'\r\n\r\nI went back to the balcony. On the way I got hold of Charlie.\r\n\r\n'We're dancing this together,' I said.\r\n\r\nHe grinned all across his face.\r\n\r\nI found Mrs Charlie looking as if she had never shed a tear in her\r\nlife. She certainly had pluck, that kid.\r\n\r\n'Come on,' I said. 'Stick to your ticket like wax and watch your step.'\r\n\r\nI guess you've seen these sporting contests at Geisenheimer's. Or, if\r\nyou haven't seen them at Geisenheimer's, you've seen them somewhere\r\nelse. They're all the same.\r\n\r\nWhen we began, the floor was so crowded that there was hardly\r\nelbow-room. Don't tell me there aren't any optimists nowadays. Everyone\r\nwas looking as if they were wondering whether to have the Love-r-ly Cup\r\nin the sitting-room or the bedroom. You never saw such a hopeful gang\r\nin your life.\r\n\r\nPresently Izzy gave tongue. The management expects him to be humorous\r\non these occasions, so he did his best.\r\n\r\n'Num-bahs, seven, eleven, and twenty-one will kindly rejoin their\r\nsorrowing friends.'\r\n\r\nThis gave us a little more elbow-room, and the band started again.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, Izzy once more: 'Num-bahs thirteen, sixteen, and\r\nseventeen--good-bye.'\r\n\r\nOff we went again.\r\n\r\n'Num-bah twelve, we hate to part with you, but--back to your table!'\r\n\r\nA plump girl in a red hat, who had been dancing with a kind smile, as\r\nif she were doing it to amuse the children, left the floor.\r\n\r\n'Num-bahs six, fifteen, and twenty, thumbs down!'\r\n\r\nAnd pretty soon the only couples left were Charlie and me, Mrs Charlie\r\nand the fellow I'd introduced her to, and a bald-headed man and a girl\r\nin a white hat. He was one of your stick-at-it performers. He had been\r\ndancing all the evening. I had noticed him from the balcony. He looked\r\nlike a hard-boiled egg from up there.\r\n\r\nHe was a trier all right, that fellow, and had things been otherwise,\r\nso to speak, I'd have been glad to see him win. But it was not to be.\r\nAh, no!\r\n\r\n'Num-bah nineteen, you're getting all flushed. Take a rest.'\r\n\r\nSo there it was, a straight contest between me and Charlie and Mrs\r\nCharlie and her man. Every nerve in my system was tingling with\r\nsuspense and excitement, was it not? It was not.\r\n\r\nCharlie, as I've already hinted, was not a dancer who took much of his\r\nattention off his feet while in action. He was there to do his\r\ndurnedest, not to inspect objects of interest by the wayside. The\r\ncorrespondence college he'd attended doesn't guarantee to teach you to\r\ndo two things at once. It won't bind itself to teach you to look round\r\nthe room while you're dancing. So Charlie hadn't the least suspicion of\r\nthe state of the drama. He was breathing heavily down my neck in a\r\ndetermined sort of way, with his eyes glued to the floor. All he knew\r\nwas that the competition had thinned out a bit, and the honour of\r\nAshley, Maine, was in his hands.\r\n\r\nYou know how the public begins to sit up and take notice when these\r\ndance-contests have been narrowed down to two couples. There are\r\nevenings when I quite forget myself, when I'm one of the last two left\r\nin, and get all excited. There's a sort of hum in the air, and, as you\r\ngo round the room, people at the tables start applauding. Why, if you\r\ndidn't know about the inner workings of the thing, you'd be all of a\r\ntwitter.\r\n\r\nIt didn't take my practised ear long to discover that it wasn't me and\r\nCharlie that the great public was cheering for. We would go round the\r\nfloor without getting a hand, and every time Mrs Charlie and her guy\r\ngot to a corner there was a noise like election night. She sure had\r\nmade a hit.\r\n\r\nI took a look at her across the floor, and I didn't wonder. She was a\r\ndifferent kid from what she'd been upstairs. I never saw anybody look\r\nso happy and pleased with herself. Her eyes were like lamps, and her\r\ncheeks all pink, and she was going at it like a champion. I knew what\r\nhad made a hit with the people. It was the look of her. She made you\r\nthink of fresh milk and new-laid eggs and birds singing. To see her was\r\nlike getting away to the country in August. It's funny about people who\r\nlive in the city. They chuck out their chests, and talk about little\r\nold New York being good enough for them, and there's a street in heaven\r\nthey call Broadway, and all the rest of it; but it seems to me that\r\nwhat they really live for is that three weeks in the summer when they\r\nget away into the country. I knew exactly why they were cheering so\r\nhard for Mrs Charlie. She made them think of their holidays which were\r\ncoming along, when they would go and board at the farm and drink out of\r\nthe old oaken bucket, and call the cows by their first names.\r\n\r\nGee! I felt just like that myself. All day the country had been tugging\r\nat me, and now it tugged worse than ever.\r\n\r\nI could have smelled the new-mown hay if it wasn't that when you're in\r\nGeisenheimer's you have to smell Geisenheimer's, because it leaves no\r\nchance for competition.\r\n\r\n'Keep working,' I said to Charlie. 'It looks to me as if we are going\r\nback in the betting.'\r\n\r\n'Uh, huh!' he says, too busy to blink.\r\n\r\n'Do some of those fancy steps of yours. We need them in our business.'\r\n\r\nAnd the way that boy worked--it was astonishing!\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of my eye I could see Izzy Baermann, and he wasn't\r\nlooking happy. He was nerving himself for one of those quick referee's\r\ndecisions--the sort you make and then duck under the ropes, and run\r\nfive miles, to avoid the incensed populace. It was this kind of thing\r\nhappening every now and then that prevented his job being perfect.\r\nMabel Francis told me that one night when Izzy declared her the winner\r\nof the great sporting contest, it was such raw work that she thought\r\nthere'd have been a riot. It looked pretty much as if he was afraid the\r\nsame thing was going to happen now. There wasn't a doubt which of us\r\ntwo couples was the one that the customers wanted to see win that\r\nLove-r-ly Silver Cup. It was a walk-over for Mrs Charlie, and Charlie\r\nand I were simply among those present.\r\n\r\nBut Izzy had his duty to do, and drew a salary for doing it, so he\r\nmoistened his lips, looked round to see that his strategic railways\r\nweren't blocked, swallowed twice, and said in a husky voice:\r\n\r\n'Num-bah ten, please re-tiah!'\r\n\r\nI stopped at once.\r\n\r\n'Come along,' said I to Charlie. 'That's our exit cue.'\r\n\r\nAnd we walked off the floor amidst applause.\r\n\r\n'Well,' says Charlie, taking out his handkerchief and attending to his\r\nbrow, which was like the village blacksmith's, 'we didn't do so bad,\r\ndid we? We didn't do so bad, I guess! We--'\r\n\r\nAnd he looked up at the balcony, expecting to see the dear little wife,\r\ndraped over the rail, worshipping him; when, just as his eye is moving\r\nup, it gets caught by the sight of her a whole heap lower down than he\r\nhad expected--on the floor, in fact.\r\n\r\nShe wasn't doing much in the worshipping line just at that moment. She\r\nwas too busy.\r\n\r\nIt was a regular triumphal progress for the kid. She and her partner\r\nwere doing one or two rounds now for exhibition purposes, like the\r\nwinning couple always do at Geisenheimer's, and the room was fairly\r\nrising at them. You'd have thought from the way they were clapping that\r\nthey had been betting all their spare cash on her.\r\n\r\nCharlie gets her well focused, then he lets his jaw drop, till he\r\npretty near bumped it against the floor.\r\n\r\n'But--but--but--' he begins.\r\n\r\n'I know,' I said. 'It begins to look as if she could dance well enough\r\nfor the city after all. It begins to look as if she had sort of put one\r\nover on somebody, don't it? It begins to look as if it were a pity you\r\ndidn't think of dancing with her yourself.'\r\n\r\n'I--I--I--'\r\n\r\n'You come along and have a nice cold drink,' I said, 'and you'll soon\r\npick up.'\r\n\r\nHe tottered after me to a table, looking as if he had been hit by a\r\nstreet-car. He had got his.\r\n\r\nI was so busy looking after Charlie, flapping the towel and working on\r\nhim with the oxygen, that, if you'll believe me, it wasn't for quite a\r\ntime that I thought of glancing around to see how the thing had struck\r\nIzzy Baermann.\r\n\r\nIf you can imagine a fond father whose only son has hit him with a\r\nbrick, jumped on his stomach, and then gone off with all his money, you\r\nhave a pretty good notion of how poor old Izzy looked. He was staring\r\nat me across the room, and talking to himself and jerking his hands\r\nabout. Whether he thought he was talking to me, or whether he was\r\nrehearsing the scene where he broke it to the boss that a mere stranger\r\nhad got away with his Love-r-ly Silver Cup, I don't know. Whichever it\r\nwas, he was being mighty eloquent.\r\n\r\nI gave him a nod, as much as to say that it would all come right in the\r\nfuture, and then I turned to Charlie again. He was beginning to pick\r\nup.\r\n\r\n'She won the cup!' he said in a dazed voice, looking at me as if I\r\ncould do something about it.\r\n\r\n'You bet she did!'\r\n\r\n'But--well, what do you know about that?'\r\n\r\nI saw that the moment had come to put it straight to him. 'I'll tell\r\nyou what I know about it,' I said. 'If you take my advice, you'll hustle\r\nthat kid straight back to Ashley--or wherever it is that you said you\r\npoison the natives by making up the wrong prescriptions--before she\r\ngets New York into her system. When I was talking to her upstairs, she\r\nwas telling me about a fellow in her village who got it in the neck\r\njust the same as you're apt to do.'\r\n\r\nHe started. 'She was telling you about Jack Tyson?'\r\n\r\n'That was his name--Jack Tyson. He lost his wife through letting her\r\nhave too much New York. Don't you think it's funny she should have\r\nmentioned him if she hadn't had some idea that she might act just the\r\nsame as his wife did?'\r\n\r\nHe turned quite green.\r\n\r\n'You don't think she would do that?'\r\n\r\n'Well, if you'd heard her--She couldn't talk of anything except this\r\nTyson, and what his wife did to him. She talked of it sort of sad, kind\r\nof regretful, as if she was sorry, but felt that it had to be. I could\r\nsee she had been thinking about it a whole lot.'\r\n\r\nCharlie stiffened in his seat, and then began to melt with pure fright.\r\nHe took up his empty glass with a shaking hand and drank a long drink\r\nout of it. It didn't take much observation to see that he had had the\r\njolt he wanted, and was going to be a whole heap less jaunty and\r\nmetropolitan from now on. In fact, the way he looked, I should say he\r\nhad finished with metropolitan jauntiness for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n'I'll take her home tomorrow,' he said. 'But--will she come?'\r\n\r\n'That's up to you. If you can persuade her--Here she is now. I should\r\nstart at once.'\r\n\r\nMrs Charlie, carrying the cup, came to the table. I was wondering what\r\nwould be the first thing she would say. If it had been Charlie, of\r\ncourse he'd have said, 'This is the life!' but I looked for something\r\nsnappier from her. If I had been in her place there were at least ten\r\nthings I could have thought of to say, each nastier than the other.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and put the cup on the table. Then she gave the cup a long\r\nlook. Then she drew a deep breath. Then she looked at Charlie.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Charlie, dear,' she said, 'I do wish I'd been dancing with you!'\r\n\r\nWell, I'm not sure that that wasn't just as good as anything I would\r\nhave said. Charlie got right off the mark. After what I had told him,\r\nhe wasn't wasting any time.\r\n\r\n'Darling,' he said, humbly, 'you're a wonder! What will they say about\r\nthis at home?' He did pause here for a moment, for it took nerve to say\r\nit; but then he went right on. 'Mary, how would it be if we went home\r\nright away--first train tomorrow, and showed it to them?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Charlie!' she said.\r\n\r\nHis face lit up as if somebody had pulled a switch.\r\n\r\n'You will? You don't want to stop on? You aren't wild about New York?'\r\n\r\n'If there was a train,' she said, 'I'd start tonight. But I thought you\r\nloved the city so, Charlie?'\r\n\r\nHe gave a kind of shiver. 'I never want to see it again in my life!' he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n'You'll excuse me,' I said, getting up, 'I think there's a friend of\r\nmine wants to speak to me.'\r\n\r\nAnd I crossed over to where Izzy had been standing for the last five\r\nminutes, making signals to me with his eyebrows.\r\n\r\nYou couldn't have called Izzy coherent at first. He certainly had\r\ntrouble with his vocal chords, poor fellow. There was one of those\r\nAfrican explorer men used to come to Geisenheimer's a lot when he was\r\nhome from roaming the trackless desert, and he used to tell me about\r\ntribes he had met who didn't use real words at all, but talked to one\r\nanother in clicks and gurgles. He imitated some of their chatter one\r\nnight to amuse me, and, believe me, Izzy Baermann started talking the\r\nsame language now. Only he didn't do it to amuse me.\r\n\r\nHe was like one of those gramophone records when it's getting into its\r\nstride.\r\n\r\n'Be calm, Isadore,' I said. 'Something is troubling you. Tell me all\r\nabout it.'\r\n\r\nHe clicked some more, and then he got it out.\r\n\r\n'Say, are you crazy? What did you do it for? Didn't I tell you as plain\r\nas I could; didn't I say it twenty times, when you came for the\r\ntickets, that yours was thirty-six?'\r\n\r\n'Didn't you say my friend's was thirty-six?'\r\n\r\n'Are you deaf? I said hers was ten.'\r\n\r\n'Then,' I said handsomely, 'say no more. The mistake was mine. It\r\nbegins to look as if I must have got them mixed.'\r\n\r\nHe did a few Swedish exercises.\r\n\r\n'Say no more? That's good! That's great! You've got nerve. I'll say\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\n'It was a lucky mistake, Izzy. It saved your life. The people would\r\nhave lynched you if you had given me the cup. They were solid for her.'\r\n\r\n'What's the boss going to say when I tell him?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind what the boss will say. Haven't you any romance in your\r\nsystem, Izzy? Look at those two sitting there with their heads\r\ntogether. Isn't it worth a silver cup to have made them happy for life?\r\nThey are on their honeymoon, Isadore. Tell the boss exactly how it\r\nhappened, and say that I thought it was up to Geisenheimer's to give\r\nthem a wedding-present.'\r\n\r\nHe clicked for a spell.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' he said. 'Ah! now you've done it! Now you've given yourself away!\r\nYou did it on purpose. You mixed those tickets on purpose. I thought as\r\nmuch. Say, who do you think you are, doing this sort of thing? Don't\r\nyou know that professional dancers are three for ten cents? I could go\r\nout right now and whistle, and get a dozen girls for your job. The\r\nboss'll sack you just one minute after I tell him.'\r\n\r\n'No, he won't, Izzy, because I'm going to resign.'\r\n\r\n'You'd better!'\r\n\r\n'That's what I think. I'm sick of this place, Izzy. I'm sick of\r\ndancing. I'm sick of New York. I'm sick of everything. I'm going back\r\nto the country. I thought I had got the pigs and chickens clear out of\r\nmy system, but I hadn't. I've suspected it for a long, long time, and\r\ntonight I know it. Tell the boss, with my love, that I'm sorry, but it\r\nhad to be done. And if he wants to talk back, he must do it by letter:\r\nMrs John Tyson, Rodney, Maine, is the address.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF MAC'S\r\n\r\n\r\nMac's Restaurant--nobody calls it MacFarland's--is a mystery. It is off\r\nthe beaten track. It is not smart. It does not advertise. It provides\r\nnothing nearer to an orchestra than a solitary piano, yet, with all\r\nthese things against it, it is a success. In theatrical circles\r\nespecially it holds a position which might turn the white lights of\r\nmany a supper-palace green with envy.\r\n\r\nThis is mysterious. You do not expect Soho to compete with and even\r\neclipse Piccadilly in this way. And when Soho does so compete, there is\r\ngenerally romance of some kind somewhere in the background.\r\n\r\nSomebody happened to mention to me casually that Henry, the old waiter,\r\nhad been at Mac's since its foundation.\r\n\r\n'Me?' said Henry, questioned during a slack spell in the afternoon.\r\n'Rather!'\r\n\r\n'Then can you tell me what it was that first gave the place the impetus\r\nwhich started it on its upward course? What causes should you say were\r\nresponsible for its phenomenal prosperity? What--'\r\n\r\n'What gave it a leg-up? Is that what you're trying to get at?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. What gave it a leg-up? Can you tell me?'\r\n\r\n'Me?' said Henry. 'Rather!'\r\n\r\nAnd he told me this chapter from the unwritten history of the London\r\nwhose day begins when Nature's finishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOld Mr MacFarland (_said Henry_) started the place fifteen years\r\nago. He was a widower with one son and what you might call half a\r\ndaughter. That's to say, he had adopted her. Katie was her name, and\r\nshe was the child of a dead friend of his. The son's name was Andy. A\r\nlittle freckled nipper he was when I first knew him--one of those\r\nsilent kids that don't say much and have as much obstinacy in them as\r\nif they were mules. Many's the time, in them days, I've clumped him on\r\nthe head and told him to do something; and he didn't run yelling to his\r\npa, same as most kids would have done, but just said nothing and went\r\non not doing whatever it was I had told him to do. That was the sort of\r\ndisposition Andy had, and it grew on him. Why, when he came back from\r\nOxford College the time the old man sent for him--what I'm going to\r\ntell you about soon--he had a jaw on him like the ram of a battleship.\r\nKatie was the kid for my money. I liked Katie. We all liked Katie.\r\n\r\nOld MacFarland started out with two big advantages. One was Jules, and\r\nthe other was me. Jules came from Paris, and he was the greatest cook\r\nyou ever seen. And me--well, I was just come from ten years as waiter\r\nat the Guelph, and I won't conceal it from you that I gave the place a\r\ntone. I gave Soho something to think about over its chop, believe me.\r\nIt was a come-down in the world for me, maybe, after the Guelph, but\r\nwhat I said to myself was that, when you get a tip in Soho, it may be\r\nonly tuppence, but you keep it; whereas at the Guelph about ninety-nine\r\nhundredths of it goes to helping to maintain some blooming head waiter\r\nin the style to which he has been accustomed. It was through my kind of\r\nharping on that fact that me and the Guelph parted company. The head\r\nwaiter complained to the management the day I called him a fat-headed\r\nvampire.\r\n\r\nWell, what with me and what with Jules, MacFarland's--it wasn't Mac's\r\nin them days--began to get a move on. Old MacFarland, who knew a good\r\nman when he saw one and always treated me more like a brother than\r\nanything else, used to say to me, 'Henry, if this keeps up, I'll be\r\nable to send the boy to Oxford College'; until one day he changed it\r\nto, 'Henry, I'm going to send the boy to Oxford College'; and next\r\nyear, sure enough, off he went.\r\n\r\nKatie was sixteen then, and she had just been given the cashier job, as\r\na treat. She wanted to do something to help the old man, so he put her\r\non a high chair behind a wire cage with a hole in it, and she gave the\r\ncustomers their change. And let me tell you, mister, that a man that\r\nwasn't satisfied after he'd had me serve him a dinner cooked by Jules\r\nand then had a chat with Katie through the wire cage would have groused\r\nat Paradise. For she was pretty, was Katie, and getting prettier every\r\nday. I spoke to the boss about it. I said it was putting temptation in\r\nthe girl's way to set her up there right in the public eye, as it were.\r\nAnd he told me to hop it. So I hopped it.\r\n\r\nKatie was wild about dancing. Nobody knew it till later, but all this\r\nwhile, it turned out, she was attending regular one of them schools.\r\nThat was where she went to in the afternoons, when we all thought she\r\nwas visiting girl friends. It all come out after, but she fooled us\r\nthen. Girls are like monkeys when it comes to artfulness. She called me\r\nUncle Bill, because she said the name Henry always reminded her of cold\r\nmutton. If it had been young Andy that had said it I'd have clumped him\r\none; but he never said anything like that. Come to think of it, he\r\nnever said anything much at all. He just thought a heap without opening\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nSo young Andy went off to college, and I said to him, 'Now then, you\r\nyoung devil, you be a credit to us, or I'll fetch you a clip when you\r\ncome home.' And Katie said, 'Oh, Andy, I _shall_ miss you.' And\r\nAndy didn't say nothing to me, and he didn't say nothing to Katie, but\r\nhe gave her a look, and later in the day I found her crying, and she\r\nsaid she'd got toothache, and I went round the corner to the chemist's\r\nand brought her something for it.\r\n\r\nIt was in the middle of Andy's second year at college that the old man\r\nhad the stroke which put him out of business. He went down under it as\r\nif he'd been hit with an axe, and the doctor tells him he'll never be\r\nable to leave his bed again.\r\n\r\nSo they sent for Andy, and he quit his college, and come back to London\r\nto look after the restaurant.\r\n\r\nI was sorry for the kid. I told him so in a fatherly kind of way. And\r\nhe just looked at me and says, 'Thanks very much, Henry.'\r\n\r\n'What must be must be,' I says. 'Maybe, it's all for the best. Maybe\r\nit's better you're here than in among all those young devils in your\r\nOxford school what might be leading you astray.'\r\n\r\n'If you would think less of me and more of your work, Henry,' he says,\r\n'perhaps that gentleman over there wouldn't have to shout sixteen times\r\nfor the waiter.'\r\n\r\nWhich, on looking into it, I found to be the case, and he went away\r\nwithout giving me no tip, which shows what you lose in a hard world by\r\nbeing sympathetic.\r\n\r\nI'm bound to say that young Andy showed us all jolly quick that he\r\nhadn't come home just to be an ornament about the place. There was\r\nexactly one boss in the restaurant, and it was him. It come a little\r\nhard at first to have to be respectful to a kid whose head you had\r\nspent many a happy hour clumping for his own good in the past; but he\r\npretty soon showed me I could do it if I tried, and I done it. As for\r\nJules and the two young fellers that had been taken on to help me owing\r\nto increase of business, they would jump through hoops and roll over if\r\nhe just looked at them. He was a boy who liked his own way, was Andy,\r\nand, believe me, at MacFarland's Restaurant he got it.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when things had settled down into a steady jog, Katie took\r\nthe bit in her teeth.\r\n\r\nShe done it quite quiet and unexpected one afternoon when there was\r\nonly me and her and Andy in the place. And I don't think either of them\r\nknew I was there, for I was taking an easy on a chair at the back,\r\nreading an evening paper.\r\n\r\nShe said, kind of quiet, 'Oh, Andy.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, darling,' he said.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the first I knew that there was anything between them.\r\n\r\n'Andy, I've something to tell you.'\r\n\r\n'What is it?'\r\n\r\nShe kind of hesitated.\r\n\r\n'Andy, dear, I shan't be able to help any more in the restaurant.'\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, sort of surprised.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I'm--I'm going on the stage.'\r\n\r\nI put down my paper. What do you mean? Did I listen? Of course I\r\nlistened. What do you take me for?\r\n\r\nFrom where I sat I could see young Andy's face, and I didn't need any\r\nmore to tell me there was going to be trouble. That jaw of his was\r\nright out. I forgot to tell you that the old man had died, poor old\r\nfeller, maybe six months before, so that now Andy was the real boss\r\ninstead of just acting boss; and what's more, in the nature of things,\r\nhe was, in a manner of speaking, Katie's guardian, with power to tell\r\nher what she could do and what she couldn't. And I felt that Katie\r\nwasn't going to have any smooth passage with this stage business which\r\nshe was giving him. Andy didn't hold with the stage--not with any girl\r\nhe was fond of being on it anyway. And when Andy didn't like a thing he\r\nsaid so.\r\n\r\nHe said so now.\r\n\r\n'You aren't going to do anything of the sort.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be horrid about it, Andy dear. I've got a big chance. Why should\r\nyou be horrid about it?'\r\n\r\n'I'm not going to argue about it. You don't go.'\r\n\r\n'But it's such a big chance. And I've been working for it for years.'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean working for it?'\r\n\r\nAnd then it came out about this dancing-school she'd been attending\r\nregular.\r\n\r\nWhen she'd finished telling him about it, he just shoved out his jaw\r\nanother inch.\r\n\r\n'You aren't going on the stage.'\r\n\r\n'But it's such a chance. I saw Mr Mandelbaum yesterday, and he saw me\r\ndance, and he was very pleased, and said he would give me a solo dance\r\nto do in this new piece he's putting on.'\r\n\r\n'You aren't going on the stage.'\r\n\r\nWhat I always say is, you can't beat tact. If you're smooth and tactful\r\nyou can get folks to do anything you want; but if you just shove your\r\njaw out at them, and order them about, why, then they get their backs\r\nup and sauce you. I knew Katie well enough to know that she would do\r\nanything for Andy, if he asked her properly; but she wasn't going to\r\nstand this sort of thing. But you couldn't drive that into the head of\r\na feller like young Andy with a steam-hammer.\r\n\r\nShe flared up, quick, as if she couldn't hold herself in no longer.\r\n\r\n'I certainly am,' she said.\r\n\r\n'You know what it means?'\r\n\r\n'What does it mean?'\r\n\r\n'The end of--everything.'\r\n\r\nShe kind of blinked as if he'd hit her, then she chucks her chin up.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' she says. 'Good-bye.'\r\n\r\n'Good-bye,' says Andy, the pig-headed young mule; and she walks out one\r\nway and he walks out another.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI don't follow the drama much as a general rule, but seeing that it was\r\nnow, so to speak, in the family, I did keep an eye open for the\r\nnewspaper notices of 'The Rose Girl', which was the name of the piece\r\nwhich Mr Mandelbaum was letting Katie do a solo dance in; and while\r\nsome of them cussed the play considerable, they all gave Katie a nice\r\nword. One feller said that she was like cold water on the morning\r\nafter, which is high praise coming from a newspaper man.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a doubt about it. She was a success. You see, she was\r\nsomething new, and London always sits up and takes notice when you give\r\nit that.\r\n\r\nThere were pictures of her in the papers, and one evening paper had a\r\npiece about 'How I Preserve My Youth' signed by her. I cut it out and\r\nshowed it to Andy.\r\n\r\nHe gave it a look. Then he gave me a look, and I didn't like his eye.\r\n\r\n'Well?' he says.\r\n\r\n'Pardon,' I says.\r\n\r\n'What about it?' he says.\r\n\r\n'I don't know,' I says.\r\n\r\n'Get back to your work,' he says.\r\n\r\nSo I got back.\r\n\r\nIt was that same night that the queer thing happened.\r\n\r\nWe didn't do much in the supper line at MacFarland's as a rule in them\r\ndays, but we kept open, of course, in case Soho should take it into its\r\nhead to treat itself to a welsh rabbit before going to bed; so all\r\nhands was on deck, ready for the call if it should come, at half past\r\neleven that night; but we weren't what you might term sanguine.\r\n\r\nWell, just on the half-hour, up drives a taxicab, and in comes a party\r\nof four. There was a nut, another nut, a girl, and another girl. And\r\nthe second girl was Katie.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, Uncle Bill!' she says.\r\n\r\n'Good evening, madam,' I says dignified, being on duty.\r\n\r\n'Oh, stop it, Uncle Bill,' she says. 'Say \"Hallo!\" to a pal, and smile\r\nprettily, or I'll tell them about the time you went to the White City.'\r\n\r\nWell, there's some bygones that are best left bygones, and the night at\r\nthe White City what she was alluding to was one of them. I still\r\nmaintain, as I always shall maintain, that the constable had no right\r\nto--but, there, it's a story that wouldn't interest you. And, anyway,\r\nI was glad to see Katie again, so I give her a smile.\r\n\r\n'Not so much of it,' I says. 'Not so much of it. I'm glad to see you,\r\nKatie.'\r\n\r\n'Three cheers! Jimmy, I want to introduce you to my friend, Uncle Bill.\r\nTed, this is Uncle Bill. Violet, this is Uncle Bill.'\r\n\r\nIt wasn't my place to fetch her one on the side of the head, but I'd of\r\nliked to have; for she was acting like she'd never used to act when I\r\nknew her--all tough and bold. Then it come to me that she was nervous.\r\nAnd natural, too, seeing young Andy might pop out any moment.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough out he popped from the back room at that very instant.\r\nKatie looked at him, and he looked at Katie, and I seen his face get\r\nkind of hard; but he didn't say a word. And presently he went out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI heard Katie breathe sort of deep.\r\n\r\n'He's looking well, Uncle Bill, ain't he?' she says to me, very soft.\r\n\r\n'Pretty fair,' I says. 'Well, kid, I been reading the pieces in the\r\npapers. You've knocked 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, don't Bill,' she says, as if I'd hurt her. And me meaning only to\r\nsay the civil thing. Girls are rum.\r\n\r\nWhen the party had paid their bill and give me a tip which made me\r\nthink I was back at the Guelph again--only there weren't any Dick\r\nTurpin of a head waiter standing by for his share--they hopped it. But\r\nKatie hung back and had a word with me.\r\n\r\n'He _was_ looking well, wasn't he, Uncle Bill?'\r\n\r\n'Rather!'\r\n\r\n'Does--does he ever speak of me?'\r\n\r\n'I ain't heard him.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose he's still pretty angry with me, isn't he, Uncle Bill?\r\nYou're sure you've never heard him speak of me?'\r\n\r\nSo, to cheer her up, I tells her about the piece in the paper I showed\r\nhim; but it didn't seem to cheer her up any. And she goes out.\r\n\r\nThe very next night in she come again for supper, but with different\r\nnuts and different girls. There was six of them this time, counting\r\nher. And they'd hardly sat down at their table, when in come the\r\nfellers she had called Jimmy and Ted with two girls. And they sat\r\neating of their suppers and chaffing one another across the floor, all\r\nas pleasant and sociable as you please.\r\n\r\n'I say, Katie,' I heard one of the nuts say, 'you were right. He's\r\nworth the price of admission.'\r\n\r\nI don't know who they meant, but they all laughed. And every now and\r\nagain I'd hear them praising the food, which I don't wonder at, for\r\nJules had certainly done himself proud. All artistic temperament, these\r\nFrenchmen are. The moment I told him we had company, so to speak, he\r\nblossomed like a flower does when you put it in water.\r\n\r\n'Ah, see, at last!' he says, trying to grab me and kiss me. 'Our fame\r\nhas gone abroad in the world which amuses himself, ain't it? For a good\r\nsupper connexion I have always prayed, and he has arrived.'\r\n\r\nWell, it did begin to look as if he was right. Ten high-class\r\nsupper-folk in an evening was pretty hot stuff for MacFarland's. I'm\r\nbound to say I got excited myself. I can't deny that I missed the\r\nGuelph at times.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth night, when the place was fairly packed and looked for all\r\nthe world like Oddy's or Romano's, and me and the two young fellers\r\nhelping me was working double tides, I suddenly understood, and I went\r\nup to Katie and, bending over her very respectful with a bottle, I\r\nwhispers, 'Hot stuff, kid. This is a jolly fine boom you're working for\r\nthe old place.' And by the way she smiled back at me, I seen I had\r\nguessed right.\r\n\r\nAndy was hanging round, keeping an eye on things, as he always done,\r\nand I says to him, when I was passing, 'She's doing us proud, bucking\r\nup the old place, ain't she?' And he says, 'Get on with your work.' And\r\nI got on.\r\n\r\nKatie hung back at the door, when she was on her way out, and had a\r\nword with me.\r\n\r\n'Has he said anything about me, Uncle Bill?'\r\n\r\n'Not a word,' I says.\r\n\r\nAnd she goes out.\r\n\r\nYou've probably noticed about London, mister, that a flock of sheep\r\nisn't in it with the nuts, the way they all troop on each other's heels\r\nto supper-places. One month they're all going to one place, next month\r\nto another. Someone in the push starts the cry that he's found a new\r\nplace, and off they all go to try it. The trouble with most of the\r\nplaces is that once they've got the custom they think it's going to\r\nkeep on coming and all they've got to do is to lean back and watch it\r\ncome. Popularity comes in at the door, and good food and good service\r\nflies out at the window. We wasn't going to have any of that at\r\nMacFarland's. Even if it hadn't been that Andy would have come down\r\nlike half a ton of bricks on the first sign of slackness, Jules and me\r\nboth of us had our professional reputations to keep up. I didn't give\r\nmyself no airs when I seen things coming our way. I worked all the\r\nharder, and I seen to it that the four young fellers under me--there\r\nwas four now--didn't lose no time fetching of the orders.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that the difference between us and most popular\r\nrestaurants was that we kept our popularity. We fed them well, and we\r\nserved them well; and once the thing had started rolling it didn't\r\nstop. Soho isn't so very far away from the centre of things, when you\r\ncome to look at it, and they didn't mind the extra step, seeing that\r\nthere was something good at the end of it. So we got our popularity,\r\nand we kept our popularity; and we've got it to this day. That's how\r\nMacFarland's came to be what it is, mister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the air of one who has told a well-rounded tale, Henry ceased, and\r\nobserved that it was wonderful the way Mr Woodward, of Chelsea,\r\npreserved his skill in spite of his advanced years.\r\n\r\nI stared at him.\r\n\r\n'But, heavens, man!' I cried, 'you surely don't think you've finished?\r\nWhat about Katie and Andy? What happened to them? Did they ever come\r\ntogether again?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, ah,' said Henry, 'I was forgetting!'\r\n\r\nAnd he resumed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs time went on, I begin to get pretty fed up with young Andy. He was\r\nmaking a fortune as fast as any feller could out of the sudden boom in\r\nthe supper-custom, and he knowing perfectly well that if it hadn't of\r\nbeen for Katie there wouldn't of been any supper-custom at all; and\r\nyou'd of thought that anyone claiming to be a human being would have\r\nhad the gratitood to forgive and forget and go over and say a civil\r\nword to Katie when she come in. But no, he just hung round looking\r\nblack at all of them; and one night he goes and fairly does it.\r\n\r\nThe place was full that night, and Katie was there, and the piano\r\ngoing, and everybody enjoying themselves, when the young feller at the\r\npiano struck up the tune what Katie danced to in the show. Catchy tune\r\nit was. 'Lum-tum-tum, tiddle-iddle-um.' Something like that it went.\r\nWell, the young feller struck up with it, and everybody begin clapping\r\nand hammering on the tables and hollering to Katie to get up and dance;\r\nwhich she done, in an open space in the middle, and she hadn't hardly\r\nstarted when along come young Andy.\r\n\r\nHe goes up to her, all jaw, and I seen something that wanted dusting on\r\nthe table next to 'em, so I went up and began dusting it, so by good\r\nluck I happened to hear the whole thing.\r\n\r\nHe says to her, very quiet, 'You can't do that here. What do you think\r\nthis place is?'\r\n\r\nAnd she says to him, 'Oh, Andy!'\r\n\r\n'I'm very much obliged to you,' he says, 'for all the trouble you\r\nseem to be taking, but it isn't necessary. MacFarland's got on very\r\nwell before your well-meant efforts to turn it into a bear-garden.'\r\n\r\nAnd him coining the money from the supper-custom! Sometimes I\r\nthink gratitood's a thing of the past and this world not fit for\r\na self-respecting rattlesnake to live in.\r\n\r\n'Andy!' she says.\r\n\r\n'That's all. We needn't argue about it. If you want to come here and\r\nhave supper, I can't stop you. But I'm not going to have the place\r\nturned into a night-club.'\r\n\r\nI don't know when I've heard anything like it. If it hadn't of been\r\nthat I hadn't of got the nerve, I'd have give him a look.\r\n\r\nKatie didn't say another word, but just went back to her table.\r\n\r\nBut the episode, as they say, wasn't conclooded. As soon as the party\r\nshe was with seen that she was through dancing, they begin to kick up a\r\nrow; and one young nut with about an inch and a quarter of forehead and\r\nthe same amount of chin kicked it up especial.\r\n\r\n'No, I say! I say, you know!' he hollered. 'That's too bad, you know.\r\nEncore! Don't stop. Encore!'\r\n\r\nAndy goes up to him.\r\n\r\n'I must ask you, please, not to make so much noise,' he says, quite\r\nrespectful. 'You are disturbing people.'\r\n\r\n'Disturbing be damned! Why shouldn't she--'\r\n\r\n'One moment. You can make all the noise you please out in the street,\r\nbut as long as you stay in here you'll be quiet. Do you understand?'\r\n\r\nUp jumps the nut. He'd had quite enough to drink. I know, because I'd\r\nbeen serving him.\r\n\r\n'Who the devil are you?' he says.\r\n\r\n'Sit down,' says Andy.\r\n\r\nAnd the young feller took a smack at him. And the next moment Andy had\r\nhim by the collar and was chucking him out in a way that would have\r\ndone credit to a real professional down Whitechapel way. He dumped him\r\non the pavement as neat as you please.\r\n\r\nThat broke up the party.\r\n\r\nYou can never tell with restaurants. What kills one makes another. I've\r\nno doubt that if we had chucked out a good customer from the Guelph\r\nthat would have been the end of the place. But it only seemed to do\r\nMacFarland's good. I guess it gave just that touch to the place which\r\nmade the nuts think that this was real Bohemia. Come to think of it, it\r\ndoes give a kind of charm to a place, if you feel that at any moment\r\nthe feller at the next table to you may be gathered up by the slack of\r\nhis trousers and slung into the street.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, that's the way our supper-custom seemed to look at it; and\r\nafter that you had to book a table in advance if you wanted to eat with\r\nus. They fairly flocked to the place.\r\n\r\nBut Katie didn't. She didn't flock. She stayed away. And no wonder,\r\nafter Andy behaving so bad. I'd of spoke to him about it, only he\r\nwasn't the kind of feller you do speak to about things.\r\n\r\nOne day I says to him to cheer him up, 'What price this restaurant now,\r\nMr Andy?'\r\n\r\n'Curse the restaurant,' he says.\r\n\r\nAnd him with all that supper-custom! It's a rum world!\r\n\r\nMister, have you ever had a real shock--something that came out of\r\nnowhere and just knocked you flat? I have, and I'm going to tell you\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nWhen a man gets to be my age, and has a job of work which keeps him\r\nbusy till it's time for him to go to bed, he gets into the habit of not\r\ndoing much worrying about anything that ain't shoved right under his\r\nnose. That's why, about now, Katie had kind of slipped my mind. It\r\nwasn't that I wasn't fond of the kid, but I'd got so much to think\r\nabout, what with having four young fellers under me and things being in\r\nsuch a rush at the restaurant that, if I thought of her at all, I just\r\ntook it for granted that she was getting along all right, and didn't\r\nbother. To be sure we hadn't seen nothing of her at MacFarland's since\r\nthe night when Andy bounced her pal with the small size in foreheads,\r\nbut that didn't worry me. If I'd been her, I'd have stopped away the\r\nsame as she done, seeing that young Andy still had his hump. I took it\r\nfor granted, as I'm telling you, that she was all right, and that the\r\nreason we didn't see nothing of her was that she was taking her\r\npatronage elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one evening, which happened to be my evening off, I got a\r\nletter, and for ten minutes after I read it I was knocked flat.\r\n\r\nYou get to believe in fate when you get to be my age, and fate certainly\r\nhad taken a hand in this game. If it hadn't of been my evening off,\r\ndon't you see, I wouldn't have got home till one o'clock or past that\r\nin the morning, being on duty. Whereas, seeing it was my evening off,\r\nI was back at half past eight.\r\n\r\nI was living at the same boarding-house in Bloomsbury what I'd lived at\r\nfor the past ten years, and when I got there I find her letter shoved\r\nhalf under my door.\r\n\r\nI can tell you every word of it. This is how it went:\r\n\r\n  _Darling Uncle Bill,_\r\n\r\n  _Don't be too sorry when you read this. It is nobody's fault,\r\n  but I am just tired of everything, and I want to end it all. You\r\n  have been such a dear to me always that I want you to be good to\r\n  me now. I should not like Andy to know the truth, so I want you\r\n  to make it seem as if it had happened naturally. You will do this\r\n  for me, won't you? It will be quite easy. By the time you get this,\r\n  it will be one, and it will all be over, and you can just come up\r\n  and open the window and let the gas out and then everyone will\r\n  think I just died naturally. It will be quite easy. I am leaving\r\n  the door unlocked so that you can get in. I am in the room just\r\n  above yours. I took it yesterday, so as to be near you. Good-bye,\r\n  Uncle Bill. You will do it for me, won't you? I don't want Andy to\r\n  know what it really was._\r\n\r\n                                           KATIE\r\n\r\nThat was it, mister, and I tell you it floored me. And then it come to\r\nme, kind of as a new idea, that I'd best do something pretty soon, and\r\nup the stairs I went quick.\r\n\r\nThere she was, on the bed, with her eyes closed, and the gas just\r\nbeginning to get bad.\r\n\r\nAs I come in, she jumped up, and stood staring at me. I went to the\r\ntap, and turned the flow off, and then I gives her a look.\r\n\r\n'Now then,' I says.\r\n\r\n'How did you get here?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind how I got here. What have you got to say for yourself?'\r\n\r\nShe just began to cry, same as she used to when she was a kid and\r\nsomeone had hurt her.\r\n\r\n'Here,' I says, 'let's get along out of here, and go where there's some\r\nair to breathe. Don't you take on so. You come along out and tell me\r\nall about it.'\r\n\r\nShe started to walk to where I was, and suddenly I seen she was\r\nlimping. So I gave her a hand down to my room, and set her on a chair.\r\n\r\n'Now then,' I says again.\r\n\r\n'Don't be angry with me, Uncle Bill,' she says.\r\n\r\nAnd she looks at me so pitiful that I goes up to her and puts my arm\r\nround her and pats her on the back.\r\n\r\n'Don't you worry, dearie,' I says, 'nobody ain't going to be angry with\r\nyou. But, for goodness' sake,' I says, 'tell a man why in the name of\r\ngoodness you ever took and acted so foolish.'\r\n\r\n'I wanted to end it all.'\r\n\r\n'But why?'\r\n\r\nShe burst out a-crying again, like a kid.\r\n\r\n'Didn't you read about it in the paper, Uncle Bill?'\r\n\r\n'Read about what in the paper?'\r\n\r\n'My accident. I broke my ankle at rehearsal ever so long ago, practising\r\nmy new dance. The doctors say it will never be right again. I shall\r\nnever be able to dance any more. I shall always limp. I shan't even be\r\nable to walk properly. And when I thought of that ... and Andy ... and\r\neverything ... I....'\r\n\r\nI got on to my feet.\r\n\r\n'Well, well, well,' I says. 'Well, well, well! I don't know as I blame\r\nyou. But don't you do it. It's a mug's game. Look here, if I leave you\r\nalone for half an hour, you won't go trying it on again? Promise.'\r\n\r\n'Very well, Uncle Bill. Where are you going?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, just out. I'll be back soon. You sit there and rest yourself.'\r\n\r\nIt didn't take me ten minutes to get to the restaurant in a cab. I\r\nfound Andy in the back room.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter, Henry?' he says.\r\n\r\n'Take a look at this,' I says.\r\n\r\nThere's always this risk, mister, in being the Andy type of feller what\r\nmust have his own way and goes straight ahead and has it; and that is\r\nthat when trouble does come to him, it comes with a rush. It sometimes\r\nseems to me that in this life we've all got to have trouble sooner or\r\nlater, and some of us gets it bit by bit, spread out thin, so to speak,\r\nand a few of us gets it in a lump--_biff_! And that was what\r\nhappened to Andy, and what I knew was going to happen when I showed him\r\nthat letter. I nearly says to him, 'Brace up, young feller, because\r\nthis is where you get it.'\r\n\r\nI don't often go to the theatre, but when I do I like one of those\r\nplays with some ginger in them which the papers generally cuss. The\r\npapers say that real human beings don't carry on in that way. Take it\r\nfrom me, mister, they do. I seen a feller on the stage read a letter\r\nonce which didn't just suit him; and he gasped and rolled his eyes and\r\ntried to say something and couldn't, and had to get a hold on a chair\r\nto keep him from falling. There was a piece in the paper saying that\r\nthis was all wrong, and that he wouldn't of done them things in real\r\nlife. Believe me, the paper was wrong. There wasn't a thing that feller\r\ndid that Andy didn't do when he read that letter.\r\n\r\n'God!' he says. 'Is she ... She isn't.... Were you in time?' he says.\r\n\r\nAnd he looks at me, and I seen that he had got it in the neck, right\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n'If you mean is she dead,' I says, 'no, she ain't dead.'\r\n\r\n'Thank God!'\r\n\r\n'Not yet,' I says.\r\n\r\nAnd the next moment we was out of that room and in the cab and moving\r\nquick.\r\n\r\nHe was never much of a talker, wasn't Andy, and he didn't chat in that\r\ncab. He didn't say a word till we was going up the stairs.\r\n\r\n'Where?' he says.\r\n\r\n'Here,' I says.\r\n\r\nAnd I opens the door.\r\n\r\nKatie was standing looking out of the window. She turned as the door\r\nopened, and then she saw Andy. Her lips parted, as if she was going to\r\nsay something, but she didn't say nothing. And Andy, he didn't say\r\nnothing, neither. He just looked, and she just looked.\r\n\r\nAnd then he sort of stumbles across the room, and goes down on his\r\nknees, and gets his arms around her.\r\n\r\n'Oh, my kid' he says.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd I seen I wasn't wanted, so I shut the door, and I hopped it. I went\r\nand saw the last half of a music-hall. But, I don't know, it didn't\r\nkind of have no fascination for me. You've got to give your mind to it\r\nto appreciate good music-hall turns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE TOUCH OF NATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feelings of Mr J. Wilmot Birdsey, as he stood wedged in the crowd\r\nthat moved inch by inch towards the gates of the Chelsea Football\r\nGround, rather resembled those of a starving man who has just been\r\ngiven a meal but realizes that he is not likely to get another for many\r\ndays. He was full and happy. He bubbled over with the joy of living and\r\na warm affection for his fellow-man. At the back of his mind there\r\nlurked the black shadow of future privations, but for the moment he did\r\nnot allow it to disturb him. On this maddest, merriest day of all the\r\nglad New Year he was content to revel in the present and allow the\r\nfuture to take care of itself.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey had been doing something which he had not done since he left\r\nNew York five years ago. He had been watching a game of baseball.\r\n\r\nNew York lost a great baseball fan when Hugo Percy de Wynter\r\nFramlinghame, sixth Earl of Carricksteed, married Mae Elinor, only\r\ndaughter of Mr and Mrs J. Wilmot Birdsey of East Seventy-Third Street;\r\nfor scarcely had that internationally important event taken place when\r\nMrs Birdsey, announcing that for the future the home would be in\r\nEngland as near as possible to dear Mae and dear Hugo, scooped J.\r\nWilmot out of his comfortable morris chair as if he had been a clam,\r\ncorked him up in a swift taxicab, and decanted him into a Deck B\r\nstateroom on the _Olympic_. And there he was, an exile.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey submitted to the worst bit of kidnapping since the days of\r\nthe old press gang with that delightful amiability which made him so\r\npopular among his fellows and such a cypher in his home. At an early\r\ndate in his married life his position had been clearly defined beyond\r\npossibility of mistake. It was his business to make money, and, when\r\ncalled upon, to jump through hoops and sham dead at the bidding of his\r\nwife and daughter Mae. These duties he had been performing\r\nconscientiously for a matter of twenty years.\r\n\r\nIt was only occasionally that his humble role jarred upon him, for he\r\nloved his wife and idolized his daughter. The international alliance\r\nhad been one of these occasions. He had no objection to Hugo Percy,\r\nsixth Earl of Carricksteed. The crushing blow had been the sentence of\r\nexile. He loved baseball with a love passing the love of women, and the\r\nprospect of never seeing a game again in his life appalled him.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one morning, like a voice from another world, had come the\r\nnews that the White Sox and the Giants were to give an exhibition in\r\nLondon at the Chelsea Football Ground. He had counted the days like a\r\nchild before Christmas.\r\n\r\nThere had been obstacles to overcome before he could attend the game,\r\nbut he had overcome them, and had been seated in the front row when the\r\ntwo teams lined up before King George.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was moving slowly from the ground with the rest of the\r\nspectators. Fate had been very good to him. It had given him a great\r\ngame, even unto two home-runs. But its crowning benevolence had been to\r\nallot the seats on either side of him to two men of his own mettle, two\r\ngod-like beings who knew every move on the board, and howled like\r\nwolves when they did not see eye to eye with the umpire. Long before\r\nthe ninth innings he was feeling towards them the affection of a\r\nshipwrecked mariner who meets a couple of boyhood's chums on a desert\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAs he shouldered his way towards the gate he was aware of these two\r\nmen, one on either side of him. He looked at them fondly, trying to\r\nmake up his mind which of them he liked best. It was sad to think that\r\nthey must soon go out of his life again for ever.\r\n\r\nHe came to a sudden resolution. He would postpone the parting. He would\r\nask them to dinner. Over the best that the Savoy Hotel could provide\r\nthey would fight the afternoon's battle over again. He did not know who\r\nthey were or anything about them, but what did that matter? They were\r\nbrother-fans. That was enough for him.\r\n\r\nThe man on his right was young, clean-shaven, and of a somewhat\r\nvulturine cast of countenance. His face was cold and impassive now,\r\nalmost forbiddingly so; but only half an hour before it had been a\r\nbattle-field of conflicting emotions, and his hat still showed the dent\r\nwhere he had banged it against the edge of his seat on the occasion of\r\nMr Daly's home-run. A worthy guest!\r\n\r\nThe man on Mr Birdsey's left belonged to another species of fan. Though\r\nthere had been times during the game when he had howled, for the most\r\npart he had watched in silence so hungrily tense that a less\r\nexperienced observer than Mr Birdsey might have attributed his\r\nimmobility to boredom. But one glance at his set jaw and gleaming eyes\r\ntold him that here also was a man and a brother.\r\n\r\nThis man's eyes were still gleaming, and under their curiously deep tan\r\nhis bearded cheeks were pale. He was staring straight in front of him\r\nwith an unseeing gaze.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey tapped the young man on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Some game!' he said.\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at him and smiled.\r\n\r\n'You bet,' he said.\r\n\r\n'I haven't seen a ball-game in five years.'\r\n\r\n'The last one I saw was two years ago next June.'\r\n\r\n'Come and have some dinner at my hotel and talk it over,' said Mr\r\nBirdsey impulsively.\r\n\r\n'Sure!' said the young man.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey turned and tapped the shoulder of the man on his left.\r\n\r\nThe result was a little unexpected. The man gave a start that was\r\nalmost a leap, and the pallor of his face became a sickly white. His\r\neyes, as he swung round, met Mr Birdsey's for an instant before they\r\ndropped, and there was panic fear in them. His breath whistled softly\r\nthrough clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey was taken aback. The cordiality of the clean-shaven young\r\nman had not prepared him for the possibility of such a reception. He\r\nfelt chilled. He was on the point of apologizing with some murmur about\r\na mistake, when the man reassured him by smiling. It was rather a\r\npainful smile, but it was enough for Mr Birdsey. This man might be of a\r\nnervous temperament, but his heart was in the right place.\r\n\r\nHe, too, smiled. He was a small, stout, red-faced little man, and he\r\npossessed a smile that rarely failed to set strangers at their ease.\r\nMany strenuous years on the New York Stock Exchange had not destroyed a\r\ncertain childlike amiability in Mr Birdsey, and it shone out when he\r\nsmiled at you.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid I startled you,' he said soothingly. 'I wanted to ask you\r\nif you would let a perfect stranger, who also happens to be an exile,\r\noffer you dinner tonight.'\r\n\r\nThe man winced. 'Exile?'\r\n\r\n'An exiled fan. Don't you feel that the Polo Grounds are a good long\r\nway away? This gentleman is joining me. I have a suite at the Savoy\r\nHotel, and I thought we might all have a quiet little dinner there and\r\ntalk about the game. I haven't seen a ball-game in five years.'\r\n\r\n'Nor have I.'\r\n\r\n'Then you must come. You really must. We fans ought to stick to one\r\nanother in a strange land. Do come.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said the bearded man; 'I will.'\r\n\r\nWhen three men, all strangers, sit down to dinner together,\r\nconversation, even if they happen to have a mutual passion for\r\nbaseball, is apt to be for a while a little difficult. The first fine\r\nfrenzy in which Mr Birdsey had issued his invitations had begun to ebb\r\nby the time the soup was served, and he was conscious of a feeling of\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nThere was some subtle hitch in the orderly progress of affairs. He\r\nsensed it in the air. Both of his guests were disposed to silence, and\r\nthe clean-shaven young man had developed a trick of staring at the man\r\nwith the beard, which was obviously distressing that sensitive person.\r\n\r\n'Wine,' murmured Mr Birdsey to the waiter. 'Wine, wine!'\r\n\r\nHe spoke with the earnestness of a general calling up his reserves for\r\nthe grand attack. The success of this little dinner mattered enormously\r\nto him. There were circumstances which were going to make it an oasis\r\nin his life. He wanted it to be an occasion to which, in grey days to\r\ncome, he could look back and be consoled. He could not let it be a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nHe was about to speak when the young man anticipated him. Leaning\r\nforward, he addressed the bearded man, who was crumbling bread with an\r\nabsent look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n'Surely we have met before?' he said. 'I'm sure I remember your face.'\r\n\r\nThe effect of these words on the other was as curious as the effect of\r\nMr Birdsey's tap on the shoulder had been. He looked up like a hunted\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head without speaking.\r\n\r\n'Curious,' said the young man. 'I could have sworn to it, and I am\r\npositive that it was somewhere in New York. Do you come from New York?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'It seems to me,' said Mr Birdsey, 'that we ought to introduce\r\nourselves. Funny it didn't strike any of us before. My name is Birdsey,\r\nJ. Wilmot Birdsey. I come from New York.'\r\n\r\n'My name is Waterall,' said the young man. 'I come from New York.'\r\n\r\nThe bearded man hesitated.\r\n\r\n'My name is Johnson. I--used to live in New York.'\r\n\r\n'Where do you live now, Mr Johnson?' asked Waterall.\r\n\r\nThe bearded man hesitated again. 'Algiers,' he said.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey was inspired to help matters along with small-talk.\r\n\r\n'Algiers,' he said. 'I have never been there, but I understand that it\r\nis quite a place. Are you in business there, Mr Johnson?'\r\n\r\n'I live there for my health.'\r\n\r\n'Have you been there some time?' inquired Waterall.\r\n\r\n'Five years.'\r\n\r\n'Then it must have been in New York that I saw you, for I have never\r\nbeen to Algiers, and I'm certain I have seen you somewhere. I'm afraid\r\nyou will think me a bore for sticking to the point like this, but the\r\nfact is, the one thing I pride myself on is my memory for faces. It's a\r\nhobby of mine. If I think I remember a face, and can't place it, I\r\nworry myself into insomnia. It's partly sheer vanity, and partly\r\nbecause in my job a good memory for faces is a mighty fine asset. It\r\nhas helped me a hundred times.'\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey was an intelligent man, and he could see that Waterall's\r\ntable-talk was for some reason getting upon Johnson's nerves. Like a\r\ngood host, he endeavoured to cut in and make things smooth.\r\n\r\n'I've heard great accounts of Algiers,' he said helpfully. 'A friend of\r\nmine was there in his yacht last year. It must be a delightful spot.'\r\n\r\n'It's a hell on earth,' snapped Johnson, and slew the conversation on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nThrough a grim silence an angel in human form fluttered in--a waiter\r\nbearing a bottle. The pop of the cork was more than music to Mr\r\nBirdsey's ears. It was the booming of the guns of the relieving army.\r\n\r\nThe first glass, as first glasses will, thawed the bearded man, to the\r\nextent of inducing him to try and pick up the fragments of the\r\nconversation which he had shattered.\r\n\r\n'I am afraid you will have thought me abrupt, Mr Birdsey,' he said\r\nawkwardly; 'but then you haven't lived in Algiers for five years, and I\r\nhave.'\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey chirruped sympathetically.\r\n\r\n'I liked it at first. It looked mighty good to me. But five years of it,\r\nand nothing else to look forward to till you die....'\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and emptied his glass. Mr Birdsey was still perturbed.\r\nTrue, conversation was proceeding in a sort of way, but it had taken a\r\ndistinctly gloomy turn. Slightly flushed with the excellent champagne\r\nwhich he had selected for this important dinner, he endeavoured to\r\nlighten it.\r\n\r\n'I wonder,' he said, 'which of us three fans had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in getting to the bleachers today. I guess none of us found\r\nit too easy.'\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Don't count on me to contribute a romantic story to this Arabian\r\nNight's Entertainment. My difficulty would have been to stop away. My\r\nname's Waterall, and I'm the London correspondent of the _New York\r\nChronicle_. I had to be there this afternoon in the way of\r\nbusiness.'\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey giggled self-consciously, but not without a certain impish\r\npride.\r\n\r\n'The laugh will be on me when you hear my confession. My daughter\r\nmarried an English earl, and my wife brought me over here to mix with\r\nhis crowd. There was a big dinner-party tonight, at which the whole\r\ngang were to be present, and it was as much as my life was worth to\r\nside-step it. But when you get the Giants and the White Sox playing\r\nball within fifty miles of you--Well, I packed a grip and sneaked out\r\nthe back way, and got to the station and caught the fast train to\r\nLondon. And what is going on back there at this moment I don't like to\r\nthink. About now,' said Mr Birdsey, looking at his watch, 'I guess\r\nthey'll be pronging the _hors d'oeuvres_ and gazing at the empty\r\nchair. It was a shame to do it, but, for the love of Mike, what else\r\ncould I have done?'\r\n\r\nHe looked at the bearded man.\r\n\r\n'Did you have any adventures, Mr Johnson?'\r\n\r\n'No. I--I just came.'\r\n\r\nThe young man Waterall leaned forward. His manner was quiet, but his\r\neyes were glittering.\r\n\r\n'Wasn't that enough of an adventure for you?' he said.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met across the table. Seated between them, Mr Birdsey looked\r\nfrom one to the other, vaguely disturbed. Something was happening, a\r\ndrama was going on, and he had not the key to it.\r\n\r\nJohnson's face was pale, and the tablecloth crumpled into a crooked\r\nridge under his fingers, but his voice was steady as he replied:\r\n\r\n'I don't understand.'\r\n\r\n'Will you understand if I give you your right name, Mr Benyon?'\r\n\r\n'What's all this?' said Mr Birdsey feebly.\r\n\r\nWaterall turned to him, the vulturine cast of his face more noticeable\r\nthan ever. Mr Birdsey was conscious of a sudden distaste for this young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n'It's quite simple, Mr Birdsey. If you have not been entertaining\r\nangels unawares, you have at least been giving a dinner to a celebrity.\r\nI told you I was sure I had seen this gentleman before. I have just\r\nremembered where, and when. This is Mr John Benyon, and I last saw him\r\nfive years ago when I was a reporter in New York, and covered his\r\ntrial.'\r\n\r\n'His trial?'\r\n\r\n'He robbed the New Asiatic Bank of a hundred thousand dollars, jumped\r\nhis bail, and was never heard of again.'\r\n\r\n'For the love of Mike!'\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey stared at his guest with eyes that grew momently wider. He\r\nwas amazed to find that deep down in him there was an unmistakable\r\nfeeling of elation. He had made up his mind, when he left home that\r\nmorning, that this was to be a day of days. Well, nobody could call\r\nthis an anti-climax.\r\n\r\n'So that's why you have been living in Algiers?'\r\n\r\nBenyon did not reply. Outside, the Strand traffic sent a faint murmur\r\ninto the warm, comfortable room.\r\n\r\nWaterall spoke. 'What on earth induced you, Benyon, to run the risk of\r\ncoming to London, where every second man you meet is a New Yorker, I\r\ncan't understand. The chances were two to one that you would be\r\nrecognized. You made a pretty big splash with that little affair of\r\nyours five years ago.'\r\n\r\nBenyon raised his head. His hands were trembling.\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you,' he said with a kind of savage force, which hurt kindly\r\nlittle Mr Birdsey like a blow. 'It was because I was a dead man, and\r\nsaw a chance of coming to life for a day; because I was sick of the\r\ndamned tomb I've been living in for five centuries; because I've been\r\naching for New York ever since I've left it--and here was a chance of\r\nbeing back there for a few hours. I knew there was a risk. I took a\r\nchance on it. Well?'\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey's heart was almost too full for words. He had found him at\r\nlast, the Super-Fan, the man who would go through fire and water for a\r\nsight of a game of baseball. Till that moment he had been regarding\r\nhimself as the nearest approach to that dizzy eminence. He had braved\r\ngreat perils to see this game. Even in this moment his mind would not\r\nwholly detach itself from speculation as to what his wife would say to\r\nhim when he slunk back into the fold. But what had he risked compared\r\nwith this man Benyon? Mr Birdsey glowed. He could not restrain his\r\nsympathy and admiration. True, the man was a criminal. He had robbed a\r\nbank of a hundred thousand dollars. But, after all, what was that? They\r\nwould probably have wasted the money in foolishness. And, anyway, a\r\nbank which couldn't take care of its money deserved to lose it.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey felt almost a righteous glow of indignation against the New\r\nAsiatic Bank.\r\n\r\nHe broke the silence which had followed Benyon's words with a\r\npeculiarly immoral remark:\r\n\r\n'Well, it's lucky it's only us that's recognized you,' he said.\r\n\r\nWaterall stared. 'Are you proposing that we should hush this thing up,\r\nMr Birdsey?' he said coldly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, well--'\r\n\r\nWaterall rose and went to the telephone.\r\n\r\n'What are you going to do?'\r\n\r\n'Call up Scotland Yard, of course. What did you think?'\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the young man was doing his duty as a citizen, yet it is to\r\nbe recorded that Mr Birdsey eyed him with unmixed horror.\r\n\r\n'You can't! You mustn't!' he cried.\r\n\r\n'I certainly shall.'\r\n\r\n'But--but--this fellow came all that way to see the ball-game.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible to Mr Birdsey that this aspect of the affair\r\nshould not be the one to strike everybody to the exclusion of all other\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n'You can't give him up. It's too raw.'\r\n\r\n'He's a convicted criminal.'\r\n\r\n'He's a fan. Why, say, he's _the_ fan.'\r\n\r\nWaterall shrugged his shoulders, and walked to the telephone. Benyon\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n'One moment.'\r\n\r\nWaterall turned, and found himself looking into the muzzle of a small\r\npistol. He laughed.\r\n\r\n'I expected that. Wave it about all you want.'\r\n\r\nBenyon rested his shaking hand on the edge of the table.\r\n\r\n'I'll shoot if you move.'\r\n\r\n'You won't. You haven't the nerve. There's nothing to you. You're just\r\na cheap crook, and that's all. You wouldn't find the nerve to pull that\r\ntrigger in a million years.'\r\n\r\nHe took off the receiver.\r\n\r\n'Give me Scotland Yard,' he said.\r\n\r\nHe had turned his back to Benyon. Benyon sat motionless. Then, with a\r\nthud, the pistol fell to the ground. The next moment Benyon had broken\r\ndown. His face was buried in his arms, and he was a wreck of a man,\r\nsobbing like a hurt child.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey was profoundly distressed. He sat tingling and helpless.\r\nThis was a nightmare.\r\n\r\nWaterall's level voice spoke at the telephone.\r\n\r\n'Is this Scotland Yard? I am Waterall, of the _New York\r\nChronicle_. Is Inspector Jarvis there? Ask him to come to the\r\nphone.... Is that you, Jarvis? This is Waterall. I'm speaking from the\r\nSavoy, Mr Birdsey's rooms. Birdsey. Listen, Jarvis. There's a man here\r\nthat's wanted by the American police. Send someone here and get him.\r\nBenyon. Robbed the New Asiatic Bank in New York. Yes, you've a warrant\r\nout for him, five years old.... All right.'\r\n\r\nHe hung up the receiver. Benyon sprang to his feet. He stood, shaking,\r\na pitiable sight. Mr Birdsey had risen with him. They stood looking at\r\nWaterall.\r\n\r\n'You--skunk!' said Mr Birdsey.\r\n\r\n'I'm an American citizen,' said Waterall, 'and I happen to have some\r\nidea of a citizen's duties. What is more, I'm a newspaper man, and I\r\nhave some idea of my duty to my paper. Call me what you like, you won't\r\nalter that.'\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey snorted.\r\n\r\n'You're suffering from ingrowing sentimentality, Mr Birdsey. That's\r\nwhat's the matter with you. Just because this man has escaped justice\r\nfor five years, you think he ought to be considered quit of the whole\r\nthing.'\r\n\r\n'But--but--'\r\n\r\n'I don't.'\r\n\r\nHe took out his cigarette case. He was feeling a great deal more\r\nstrung-up and nervous than he would have had the others suspect. He had\r\nhad a moment of very swift thinking before he had decided to treat that\r\nugly little pistol in a spirit of contempt. Its production had given\r\nhim a decided shock, and now he was suffering from reaction. As a\r\nconsequence, because his nerves were strained, he lit his cigarette\r\nvery languidly, very carefully, and with an offensive superiority which\r\nwas to Mr Birdsey the last straw.\r\n\r\nThese things are matters of an instant. Only an infinitesimal fraction\r\nof time elapsed between the spectacle of Mr Birdsey, indignant but\r\ninactive, and Mr Birdsey berserk, seeing red, frankly and undisguisedly\r\nrunning amok. The transformation took place in the space of time\r\nrequired for the lighting of a match.\r\n\r\nEven as the match gave out its flame, Mr Birdsey sprang.\r\n\r\nAeons before, when the young blood ran swiftly in his veins and life\r\nwas all before him, Mr Birdsey had played football. Once a footballer,\r\nalways a potential footballer, even to the grave. Time had removed the\r\nflying tackle as a factor in Mr Birdsey's life. Wrath brought it back.\r\nHe dived at young Mr Waterall's neatly trousered legs as he had dived\r\nat other legs, less neatly trousered, thirty years ago. They crashed to\r\nthe floor together; and with the crash came Mr Birdsey's shout:\r\n\r\n'Run! Run, you fool! Run!'\r\n\r\nAnd, even as he clung to his man, breathless, bruised, feeling as if\r\nall the world had dissolved in one vast explosion of dynamite, the door\r\nopened, banged to, and feet fled down the passage.\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey disentangled himself, and rose painfully. The shock had\r\nbrought him to himself. He was no longer berserk. He was a middle-aged\r\ngentleman of high respectability who had been behaving in a very\r\npeculiar way.\r\n\r\nWaterall, flushed and dishevelled, glared at him speechlessly. He\r\ngulped. 'Are you crazy?'\r\n\r\nMr Birdsey tested gingerly the mechanism of a leg which lay under\r\nsuspicion of being broken. Relieved, he put his foot to the ground\r\nagain. He shook his head at Waterall. He was slightly crumpled, but he\r\nachieved a manner of dignified reproof.\r\n\r\n'You shouldn't have done it, young man. It was raw work. Oh, yes, I\r\nknow all about that duty-of-a-citizen stuff. It doesn't go. There are\r\nexceptions to every rule, and this was one of them. When a man risks\r\nhis liberty to come and root at a ball-game, you've got to hand it to\r\nhim. He isn't a crook. He's a fan. And we exiled fans have got to stick\r\ntogether.'\r\n\r\nWaterall was quivering with fury, disappointment, and the peculiar\r\nunpleasantness of being treated by an elderly gentleman like a sack of\r\ncoals. He stammered with rage.\r\n\r\n'You damned old fool, do you realize what you've done? The police will\r\nbe here in another minute.'\r\n\r\n'Let them come.'\r\n\r\n'But what am I to say to them? What explanation can I give? What story\r\ncan I tell them? Can't you see what a hole you've put me in?'\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to click inside Mr Birdsey's soul. It was the berserk\r\nmood vanishing and reason leaping back on to her throne. He was able\r\nnow to think calmly, and what he thought about filled him with a sudden\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\n'Young man,' he said, 'don't worry yourself. You've got a cinch. You've\r\nonly got to hand a story to the police. Any old tale will do for them.\r\nI'm the man with the really difficult job--I've got to square myself\r\nwith my wife!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK FOR LUCK\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was black, but comely. Obviously in reduced circumstances, he had\r\nnevertheless contrived to retain a certain smartness, a certain\r\nair--what the French call the _tournure_. Nor had poverty killed\r\nin him the aristocrat's instinct of personal cleanliness; for even as\r\nElizabeth caught sight of him he began to wash himself.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her step he looked up. He did not move, but there was\r\nsuspicion in his attitude. The muscles of his back contracted, his eyes\r\nglowed like yellow lamps against black velvet, his tail switched a\r\nlittle, warningly.\r\n\r\nElizabeth looked at him. He looked at Elizabeth. There was a pause,\r\nwhile he summed her up. Then he stalked towards her, and, suddenly\r\nlowering his head, drove it vigorously against her dress. He permitted\r\nher to pick him up and carry him into the hall-way, where Francis, the\r\njanitor, stood.\r\n\r\n'Francis,' said Elizabeth, 'does this cat belong to anyone here?'\r\n\r\n'No, miss. That cat's a stray, that cat is. I been trying to locate\r\nthat cat's owner for days.'\r\n\r\nFrancis spent his time trying to locate things. It was the one\r\nrecreation of his eventless life. Sometimes it was a noise, sometimes a\r\nlost letter, sometimes a piece of ice which had gone astray in the\r\ndumb-waiter--whatever it was, Francis tried to locate it.\r\n\r\n'Has he been round here long, then?'\r\n\r\n'I seen him snooping about a considerable time.'\r\n\r\n'I shall keep him.'\r\n\r\n'Black cats bring luck,' said Francis sententiously.\r\n\r\n'I certainly shan't object to that,' said Elizabeth. She was feeling\r\nthat morning that a little luck would be a pleasing novelty. Things had\r\nnot been going very well with her of late. It was not so much that the\r\nusual proportion of her manuscripts had come back with editorial\r\ncompliments from the magazine to which they had been sent--she accepted\r\nthat as part of the game; what she did consider scurvy treatment at the\r\nhands of fate was the fact that her own pet magazine, the one to which\r\nshe had been accustomed to fly for refuge, almost sure of a\r\nwelcome--when coldly treated by all the others--had suddenly expired\r\nwith a low gurgle for want of public support. It was like losing a kind\r\nand open-handed relative, and it made the addition of a black cat to\r\nthe household almost a necessity.\r\n\r\nIn her flat, the door closed, she watched her new ally with some\r\nanxiety. He had behaved admirably on the journey upstairs, but she\r\nwould not have been surprised, though it would have pained her, if he\r\nhad now proceeded to try to escape through the ceiling. Cats were so\r\nemotional. However, he remained calm, and, after padding silently about\r\nthe room for awhile, raised his head and uttered a crooning cry.\r\n\r\n'That's right,' said Elizabeth, cordially. 'If you don't see what you\r\nwant, ask for it. The place is yours.'\r\n\r\nShe went to the ice-box, and produced milk and sardines. There was\r\nnothing finicky or affected about her guest. He was a good trencherman,\r\nand he did not care who knew it. He concentrated himself on the\r\nrestoration of his tissues with the purposeful air of one whose last\r\nmeal is a dim memory. Elizabeth, brooding over him like a Providence,\r\nwrinkled her forehead in thought.\r\n\r\n'Joseph,' she said at last, brightening; 'that's your name. Now settle\r\ndown, and start being a mascot.'\r\n\r\nJoseph settled down amazingly. By the end of the second day he was\r\nconveying the impression that he was the real owner of the apartment,\r\nand that it was due to his good nature that Elizabeth was allowed the\r\nrun of the place. Like most of his species, he was an autocrat. He\r\nwaited a day to ascertain which was Elizabeth's favourite chair, then\r\nappropriated it for his own. If Elizabeth closed a door while he was in\r\na room, he wanted it opened so that he might go out; if she closed it\r\nwhile he was outside, he wanted it opened so that he might come in; if\r\nshe left it open, he fussed about the draught. But the best of us have\r\nour faults, and Elizabeth adored him in spite of his.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing what a difference he made in her life. She was a\r\nfriendly soul, and until Joseph's arrival she had had to depend for\r\ncompany mainly on the footsteps of the man in the flat across the way.\r\nMoreover, the building was an old one, and it creaked at night. There\r\nwas a loose board in the passage which made burglar noises in the dark\r\nbehind you when you stepped on it on the way to bed; and there were\r\nfunny scratching sounds which made you jump and hold your breath.\r\nJoseph soon put a stop to all that. With Joseph around, a loose board\r\nbecame a loose board, nothing more, and a scratching noise just a plain\r\nscratching noise.\r\n\r\nAnd then one afternoon he disappeared.\r\n\r\nHaving searched the flat without finding him, Elizabeth went to the\r\nwindow, with the intention of making a bird's-eye survey of the street.\r\nShe was not hopeful, for she had just come from the street, and there\r\nhad been no sign of him then.\r\n\r\nOutside the window was a broad ledge, running the width of the\r\nbuilding. It terminated on the left, in a shallow balcony belonging to\r\nthe flat whose front door faced hers--the flat of the young man whose\r\nfootsteps she sometimes heard. She knew he was a young man, because\r\nFrancis had told her so. His name, James Renshaw Boyd, she had learned\r\nfrom the same source.\r\n\r\nOn this shallow balcony, licking his fur with the tip of a crimson\r\ntongue and generally behaving as if he were in his own backyard, sat\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n'Jo-seph!' cried Elizabeth--surprise, joy, and reproach combining to\r\ngive her voice an almost melodramatic quiver.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her coldly. Worse, he looked at her as if she had been an\r\nutter stranger. Bulging with her meat and drink, he cut her dead; and,\r\nhaving done so, turned and walked into the next flat.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was a girl of spirit. Joseph might look at her as if she were\r\na saucerful of tainted milk, but he was her cat, and she meant to get\r\nhim back. She went out and rang the bell of Mr James Renshaw Boyd's\r\nflat.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by a shirt-sleeved young man. He was by no means an\r\nunsightly young man. Indeed, of his type--the rough-haired,\r\nclean-shaven, square-jawed type--he was a distinctly good-looking young\r\nman. Even though she was regarding him at the moment purely in the\r\nlight of a machine for returning strayed cats, Elizabeth noticed that.\r\n\r\nShe smiled upon him. It was not the fault of this nice-looking young\r\nman that his sitting-room window was open; or that Joseph was an\r\nungrateful little beast who should have no fish that night.\r\n\r\n'Would you mind letting me have my cat, please?' she said pleasantly.\r\n'He has gone into your sitting-room through the window.'\r\n\r\nHe looked faintly surprised.\r\n\r\n'Your cat?'\r\n\r\n'My black cat, Joseph. He is in your sitting-room.'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid you have come to the wrong place. I've just left my\r\nsitting-room, and the only cat there is my black cat, Reginald.'\r\n\r\n'But I saw Joseph go in only a minute ago.'\r\n\r\n'That was Reginald.'\r\n\r\nFor the first time, as one who examining a fair shrub abruptly\r\ndiscovers that it is a stinging-nettle, Elizabeth realized the truth.\r\nThis was no innocent young man who stood before her, but the blackest\r\ncriminal known to criminologists--a stealer of other people's cats. Her\r\nmanner shot down to zero.\r\n\r\n'May I ask how long you have had your Reginald?'\r\n\r\n'Since four o'clock this afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'Did he come in through the window?'\r\n\r\n'Why, yes. Now you mention it, he did.'\r\n\r\n'I must ask you to be good enough to give me back my cat,' said\r\nElizabeth, icily.\r\n\r\nHe regarded her defensively.\r\n\r\n'Assuming,' he said, 'purely for the purposes of academic argument,\r\nthat your Joseph is my Reginald, couldn't we come to an agreement of\r\nsome sort? Let me buy you another cat. A dozen cats.'\r\n\r\n'I don't want a dozen cats. I want Joseph.'\r\n\r\n'Fine, fat, soft cats,' he went on persuasively. 'Lovely, affectionate\r\nPersians and Angoras, and--'\r\n\r\n'Of course, if you intend to steal Joseph--'\r\n\r\n'These are harsh words. Any lawyer will tell you that there are special\r\nstatutes regarding cats. To retain a stray cat is not a tort or a\r\nmisdemeanour. In the celebrated test-case of Wiggins _v_. Bluebody\r\nit was established--'\r\n\r\n'Will you please give me back my cat?'\r\n\r\nShe stood facing him, her chin in the air and her eyes shining, and the\r\nyoung man suddenly fell a victim to conscience.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said, 'I'll throw myself on your mercy. I admit the cat\r\nis your cat, and that I have no right to it, and that I am just a\r\ncommon sneak-thief. But consider. I had just come back from the first\r\nrehearsal of my first play; and as I walked in at the door that cat\r\nwalked in at the window. I'm as superstitious as a coon, and I felt\r\nthat to give him up would be equivalent to killing the play before ever\r\nit was produced. I know it will sound absurd to you. _You_ have no\r\nidiotic superstitions. You are sane and practical. But, in the\r\ncircumstances, if you _could_ see your way to waiving your\r\nrights--'\r\n\r\nBefore the wistfulness of his eye Elizabeth capitulated. She felt quite\r\novercome by the revulsion of feeling which swept through her. How she\r\nhad misjudged him! She had taken him for an ordinary soulless purloiner\r\nof cats, a snapper-up of cats at random and without reason; and all the\r\ntime he had been reluctantly compelled to the act by this deep and\r\npraiseworthy motive. All the unselfishness and love of sacrifice innate\r\nin good women stirred within her.\r\n\r\n'Why, of _course_ you mustn't let him go! It would mean awful bad\r\nluck.'\r\n\r\n'But how about you--'\r\n\r\n'Never mind about me. Think of all the people who are dependent on your\r\nplay being a success.'\r\n\r\nThe young man blinked.\r\n\r\n'This is overwhelming,' he said.\r\n\r\n'I had no notion why you wanted him. He was nothing to me--at least,\r\nnothing much--that is to say--well, I suppose I was rather fond of\r\nhim--but he was not--not--'\r\n\r\n'Vital?'\r\n\r\n'That's just the word I wanted. He was just company, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Haven't you many friends?'\r\n\r\n'I haven't any friends.'\r\n\r\n'You haven't any friends! That settles it. You must take him back.'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't think of it.'\r\n\r\n'Of course you must take him back at once.'\r\n\r\n'I really couldn't.'\r\n\r\n'You must.'\r\n\r\n'I won't.'\r\n\r\n'But, good gracious, how do you suppose I should feel, knowing that you\r\nwere all alone and that I had sneaked your--your ewe lamb, as it were?'\r\n\r\n'And how do you suppose I should feel if your play failed simply for\r\nlack of a black cat?'\r\n\r\nHe started, and ran his fingers through his rough hair in an\r\noverwrought manner.\r\n\r\n'Solomon couldn't have solved this problem,' he said. 'How would it\r\nbe--it seems the only possible way out--if you were to retain a sort of\r\nmanagerial right in him? Couldn't you sometimes step across and chat\r\nwith him--and me, incidentally--over here? I'm very nearly as lonesome\r\nas you are. Chicago is my home. I hardly know a soul in New York.'\r\n\r\nHer solitary life in the big city had forced upon Elizabeth the ability\r\nto form instantaneous judgements on the men she met. She flashed a\r\nglance at the young man and decided in his favour.\r\n\r\n'It's very kind of you,' she said. 'I should love to. I want to hear\r\nall about your play. I write myself, you know, in a very small way, so\r\na successful playwright is Someone to me.'\r\n\r\n'I wish I were a successful playwright.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you are having the first play you have ever written produced on\r\nBroadway. That's pretty wonderful.'\r\n\r\n''M--yes,' said the young man. It seemed to Elizabeth that he spoke\r\ndoubtfully, and this modesty consolidated the favourable impression she\r\nhad formed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe gods are just. For every ill which they inflict they also supply a\r\ncompensation. It seems good to them that individuals in big cities\r\nshall be lonely, but they have so arranged that, if one of these\r\nindividuals does at last contrive to seek out and form a friendship\r\nwith another, that friendship shall grow more swiftly than the tepid\r\nacquaintanceships of those on whom the icy touch of loneliness has\r\nnever fallen. Within a week Elizabeth was feeling that she had known\r\nthis James Renshaw Boyd all her life.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was a tantalizing incompleteness about his personal\r\nreminiscences. Elizabeth was one of those persons who like to begin a\r\nfriendship with a full statement of their position, their previous\r\nlife, and the causes which led up to their being in this particular\r\nspot at this particular time. At their next meeting, before he had had\r\ntime to say much on his own account, she had told him of her life in\r\nthe small Canadian town where she had passed the early part of her\r\nlife; of the rich and unexpected aunt who had sent her to college for\r\nno particular reason that anyone could ascertain except that she\r\nenjoyed being unexpected; of the legacy from this same aunt, far\r\nsmaller than might have been hoped for, but sufficient to send a\r\ngrateful Elizabeth to New York, to try her luck there; of editors,\r\nmagazines, manuscripts refused or accepted, plots for stories; of life\r\nin general, as lived down where the Arch spans Fifth Avenue and the\r\nlighted cross of the Judson shines by night on Washington Square.\r\n\r\nCeasing eventually, she waited for him to begin; and he did not\r\nbegin--not, that is to say, in the sense the word conveyed to\r\nElizabeth. He spoke briefly of college, still more briefly of\r\nChicago--which city he appeared to regard with a distaste that made\r\nLot's attitude towards the Cities of the Plain almost kindly by\r\ncomparison. Then, as if he had fulfilled the demands of the most\r\nexacting inquisitor in the matter of personal reminiscence, he began to\r\nspeak of the play.\r\n\r\nThe only facts concerning him to which Elizabeth could really have\r\nsworn with a clear conscience at the end of the second week of their\r\nacquaintance were that he was very poor, and that this play meant\r\neverything to him.\r\n\r\nThe statement that it meant everything to him insinuated itself so\r\nfrequently into his conversation that it weighed on Elizabeth's mind\r\nlike a burden, and by degrees she found herself giving the play place\r\nof honour in her thoughts over and above her own little ventures. With\r\nthis stupendous thing hanging in the balance, it seemed almost wicked\r\nof her to devote a moment to wondering whether the editor of an evening\r\npaper, who had half promised to give her the entrancing post of Adviser\r\nto the Lovelorn on his journal, would fulfil that half-promise.\r\n\r\nAt an early stage in their friendship the young man had told her the\r\nplot of the piece; and if he had not unfortunately forgotten several\r\nimportant episodes and had to leap back to them across a gulf of one or\r\ntwo acts, and if he had referred to his characters by name instead of\r\nby such descriptions as 'the fellow who's in love with the girl--not\r\nwhat's-his-name but the other chap'--she would no doubt have got that\r\nmental half-Nelson on it which is such a help towards the proper\r\nunderstanding of a four-act comedy. As it was, his precis had left her\r\na little vague; but she said it was perfectly splendid, and he said did\r\nshe really think so. And she said yes, she did, and they were both\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nRehearsals seemed to prey on his spirits a good deal. He attended them\r\nwith the pathetic regularity of the young dramatist, but they appeared\r\nto bring him little balm. Elizabeth generally found him steeped in\r\ngloom, and then she would postpone the recital, to which she had been\r\nlooking forward, of whatever little triumph she might have happened to\r\nwin, and devote herself to the task of cheering him up. If women were\r\nwonderful in no other way, they would be wonderful for their genius for\r\nlistening to shop instead of talking it.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was feeling more than a little proud of the way in which her\r\njudgement of this young man was being justified. Life in Bohemian New\r\nYork had left her decidedly wary of strange young men, not formally\r\nintroduced; her faith in human nature had had to undergo much\r\nstraining. Wolves in sheep's clothing were common objects of the\r\nwayside in her unprotected life; and perhaps her chief reason for\r\nappreciating this friendship was the feeling of safety which it gave\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTheir relations, she told herself, were so splendidly unsentimental.\r\nThere was no need for that silent defensiveness which had come to seem\r\nalmost an inevitable accompaniment to dealings with the opposite sex.\r\nJames Boyd, she felt, she could trust; and it was wonderful how\r\nsoothing the reflexion was.\r\n\r\nAnd that was why, when the thing happened, it so shocked and frightened\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt had been one of their quiet evenings. Of late they had fallen into\r\nthe habit of sitting for long periods together without speaking. But it\r\nhad differed from other quiet evenings through the fact that\r\nElizabeth's silence hid a slight but well-defined feeling of injury.\r\nUsually she sat happy with her thoughts, but tonight she was ruffled.\r\nShe had a grievance.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the editor of the evening paper, whose angelic status\r\nnot even a bald head and an absence of wings and harp could conceal,\r\nhad definitely informed her that the man who had conducted the column\r\nhitherto having resigned, the post of Heloise Milton, official adviser\r\nto readers troubled with affairs of the heart, was hers; and he looked\r\nto her to justify the daring experiment of letting a woman handle so\r\nresponsible a job. Imagine how Napoleon felt after Austerlitz, picture\r\nColonel Goethale contemplating the last spadeful of dirt from the\r\nPanama Canal, try to visualize a suburban householder who sees a flower\r\nemerging from the soil in which he has inserted a packet of guaranteed\r\nseeds, and you will have some faint conception how Elizabeth felt as\r\nthose golden words proceeded from that editor's lips. For the moment\r\nAmbition was sated. The years, rolling by, might perchance open out\r\nother vistas; but for the moment she was content.\r\n\r\nInto James Boyd's apartment she had walked, stepping on fleecy clouds\r\nof rapture, to tell him the great news.\r\n\r\nShe told him the great news.\r\n\r\nHe said, 'Ah!'\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of saying 'Ah!' You can put joy, amazement, rapture\r\ninto it; you can also make it sound as if it were a reply to a remark\r\non the weather. James Boyd made it sound just like that. His hair was\r\nrumpled, his brow contracted, and his manner absent. The impression he\r\ngave Elizabeth was that he had barely heard her. The next moment he was\r\ndeep in a recital of the misdemeanours of the actors now rehearsing for\r\nhis four-act comedy. The star had done this, the leading woman that,\r\nthe juvenile something else. For the first time Elizabeth listened\r\nunsympathetically.\r\n\r\nThe time came when speech failed James Boyd, and he sat back in his\r\nchair, brooding. Elizabeth, cross and wounded, sat in hers, nursing\r\nJoseph. And so, in a dim light, time flowed by.\r\n\r\nJust how it happened she never knew. One moment, peace; the next chaos.\r\nOne moment stillness; the next, Joseph hurtling through the air, all\r\nclaws and expletives, and herself caught in a clasp which shook the\r\nbreath from her.\r\n\r\nOne can dimly reconstruct James's train of thought. He is in despair;\r\nthings are going badly at the theatre, and life has lost its savour.\r\nHis eye, as he sits, is caught by Elizabeth's profile. It is a\r\npretty--above all, a soothing--profile. An almost painful\r\nsentimentality sweeps over James Boyd. There she sits, his only friend\r\nin this cruel city. If you argue that there is no necessity to spring\r\nat your only friend and nearly choke her, you argue soundly; the point\r\nis well taken. But James Boyd was beyond the reach of sound argument.\r\nMuch rehearsing had frayed his nerves to ribbons. One may say that he\r\nwas not responsible for his actions.\r\n\r\nThat is the case for James. Elizabeth, naturally, was not in a position\r\nto take a wide and understanding view of it. All she knew was that James\r\nhad played her false, abused her trust in him. For a moment, such was\r\nthe shock of the surprise, she was not conscious of indignation--or,\r\nindeed, of any sensation except the purely physical one of\r\nsemi-strangulation. Then, flushed, and more bitterly angry than she\r\ncould ever have imagined herself capable of being, she began to\r\nstruggle. She tore herself away from him. Coming on top of her\r\ngrievance, this thing filled her with a sudden, very vivid hatred of\r\nJames. At the back of her anger, feeding it, was the humiliating\r\nthought that it was all her own fault, that by her presence there she\r\nhad invited this.\r\n\r\nShe groped her way to the door. Something was writhing and struggling\r\ninside her, blinding her eyes, and robbing her of speech. She was only\r\nconscious of a desire to be alone, to be back and safe in her own home.\r\nShe was aware that he was speaking, but the words did not reach her.\r\nShe found the door, and pulled it open. She felt a hand on her arm, but\r\nshe shook it off. And then she was back behind her own door, alone and\r\nat liberty to contemplate at leisure the ruins of that little temple of\r\nfriendship which she had built up so carefully and in which she had\r\nbeen so happy.\r\n\r\nThe broad fact that she would never forgive him was for a while her\r\nonly coherent thought. To this succeeded the determination that she\r\nwould never forgive herself. And having thus placed beyond the pale the\r\nonly two friends she had in New York, she was free to devote herself\r\nwithout hindrance to the task of feeling thoroughly lonely and\r\nwretched.\r\n\r\nThe shadows deepened. Across the street a sort of bubbling explosion,\r\nfollowed by a jerky glare that shot athwart the room, announced the\r\nlighting of the big arc-lamp on the opposite side-walk. She resented\r\nit, being in the mood for undiluted gloom; but she had not the energy\r\nto pull down the shade and shut it out. She sat where she was, thinking\r\nthoughts that hurt.\r\n\r\nThe door of the apartment opposite opened. There was a single ring at\r\nher bell. She did not answer it. There came another. She sat where she\r\nwas, motionless. The door closed again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe days dragged by. Elizabeth lost count of time. Each day had its\r\nduties, which ended when you went to bed; that was all she knew--except\r\nthat life had become very grey and very lonely, far lonelier even than\r\nin the time when James Boyd was nothing to her but an occasional sound\r\nof footsteps.\r\n\r\nOf James she saw nothing. It is not difficult to avoid anyone in New\r\nYork, even when you live just across the way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Elizabeth's first act each morning, immediately on awaking, to\r\nopen her front door and gather in whatever lay outside it. Sometimes\r\nthere would be mail; and always, unless Francis, as he sometimes did,\r\ngot mixed and absent-minded, the morning milk and the morning paper.\r\n\r\nOne morning, some two weeks after that evening of which she tried not\r\nto think, Elizabeth, opening the door, found immediately outside it a\r\nfolded scrap of paper. She unfolded it.\r\n\r\n  _I am just off to the theatre. Won't you wish me luck? I feel sure\r\n  it is going to be a hit. Joseph is purring like a dynamo._--J.R.B.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning the brain works sluggishly. For an instant\r\nElizabeth stood looking at the words uncomprehendingly; then, with a\r\nleaping of the heart, their meaning came home to her. He must have left\r\nthis at her door on the previous night. The play had been produced! And\r\nsomewhere in the folded interior of the morning paper at her feet must\r\nbe the opinion of 'One in Authority' concerning it!\r\n\r\nDramatic criticisms have this peculiarity, that if you are looking for\r\nthem, they burrow and hide like rabbits. They dodge behind murders;\r\nthey duck behind baseball scores; they lie up snugly behind the Wall\r\nStreet news. It was a full minute before Elizabeth found what she\r\nsought, and the first words she read smote her like a blow.\r\n\r\nIn that vein of delightful facetiousness which so endears him to all\r\nfollowers and perpetrators of the drama, the 'One in Authority' rent\r\nand tore James Boyd's play. He knocked James Boyd's play down, and\r\nkicked it; he jumped on it with large feet; he poured cold water on it,\r\nand chopped it into little bits. He merrily disembowelled James Boyd's\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nElizabeth quivered from head to foot. She caught at the door-post to\r\nsteady herself. In a flash all her resentment had gone, wiped away and\r\nannihilated like a mist before the sun. She loved him, and she knew now\r\nthat she had always loved him.\r\n\r\nIt took her two seconds to realize that the 'One in Authority' was a\r\nmiserable incompetent, incapable of recognizing merit when it was\r\ndisplayed before him. It took her five minutes to dress. It took her a\r\nminute to run downstairs and out to the news-stand on the corner of the\r\nstreet. Here, with a lavishness which charmed and exhilarated the\r\nproprietor, she bought all the other papers which he could supply.\r\n\r\nMoments of tragedy are best described briefly. Each of the papers\r\nnoticed the play, and each of them damned it with uncompromising\r\nheartiness. The criticisms varied only in tone. One cursed with relish\r\nand gusto; another with a certain pity; a third with a kind of wounded\r\nsuperiority, as of one compelled against his will to speak of something\r\nunspeakable; but the meaning of all was the same. James Boyd's play was\r\na hideous failure.\r\n\r\nBack to the house sped Elizabeth, leaving the organs of a free people\r\nto be gathered up, smoothed, and replaced on the stand by the now more\r\nthan ever charmed proprietor. Up the stairs she sped, and arriving\r\nbreathlessly at James's door rang the bell.\r\n\r\nHeavy footsteps came down the passage; crushed, disheartened footsteps;\r\nfootsteps that sent a chill to Elizabeth's heart. The door opened.\r\nJames Boyd stood before her, heavy-eyed and haggard. In his eyes was\r\ndespair, and on his chin the blue growth of beard of the man from whom\r\nthe mailed fist of Fate has smitten the energy to perform his morning\r\nshave.\r\n\r\nBehind him, littering the floor, were the morning papers; and at the\r\nsight of them Elizabeth broke down.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Jimmy, darling!' she cried; and the next moment she was in his\r\narms, and for a space time stood still.\r\n\r\nHow long afterwards it was she never knew; but eventually James Boyd\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n'If you'll marry me,' he said hoarsely, 'I don't care a hang.'\r\n\r\n'Jimmy, darling!' said Elizabeth, 'of course I will.'\r\n\r\nPast them, as they stood there, a black streak shot silently, and\r\ndisappeared out of the door. Joseph was leaving the sinking ship.\r\n\r\n'Let him go, the fraud,' said Elizabeth bitterly. 'I shall never\r\nbelieve in black cats again.'\r\n\r\nBut James was not of this opinion.\r\n\r\n'Joseph has brought me all the luck I need.'\r\n\r\n'But the play meant everything to you.'\r\n\r\n'It did then.'\r\n\r\nElizabeth hesitated.\r\n\r\n'Jimmy, dear, it's all right, you know. I know you will make a fortune\r\nout of your next play, and I've heaps for us both to live on till you\r\nmake good. We can manage splendidly on my salary from the _Evening\r\nChronicle_.'\r\n\r\n'What! Have you got a job on a New York paper?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I told you about it. I am doing Heloise Milton. Why, what's the\r\nmatter?'\r\n\r\nHe groaned hollowly.\r\n\r\n'And I was thinking that you would come back to Chicago with me!'\r\n\r\n'But I will. Of course I will. What did you think I meant to do?'\r\n\r\n'What! Give up a real job in New York!' He blinked. 'This isn't really\r\nhappening. I'm dreaming.'\r\n\r\n'But, Jimmy, are you sure you can get work in Chicago? Wouldn't it be\r\nbetter to stay on here, where all the managers are, and--'\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n'I think it's time I told you about myself,' he said. 'Am I sure I can\r\nget work in Chicago? I am, worse luck. Darling, have you in your more\r\nmaterial moments ever toyed with a Boyd's Premier Breakfast-Sausage or\r\nkept body and soul together with a slice off a Boyd's Excelsior\r\nHome-Cured Ham? My father makes them, and the tragedy of my life is\r\nthat he wants me to help him at it. This was my position. I loathed the\r\nfamily business as much as dad loved it. I had a notion--a fool notion,\r\nas it has turned out--that I could make good in the literary line. I've\r\nscribbled in a sort of way ever since I was in college. When the time\r\ncame for me to join the firm, I put it to dad straight. I said, \"Give\r\nme a chance, one good, square chance, to see if the divine fire is\r\nreally there, or if somebody has just turned on the alarm as a\r\npractical joke.\" And we made a bargain. I had written this play, and we\r\nmade it a test-case. We fixed it up that dad should put up the money to\r\ngive it a Broadway production. If it succeeded, all right; I'm the\r\nyoung Gus Thomas, and may go ahead in the literary game. If it's a\r\nfizzle, off goes my coat, and I abandon pipe-dreams of literary\r\ntriumphs and start in as the guy who put the Co. in Boyd & Co. Well,\r\nevents have proved that I _am_ the guy, and now I'm going to keep\r\nmy part of the bargain just as squarely as dad kept his. I know quite\r\nwell that if I refused to play fair and chose to stick on here in New\r\nYork and try again, dad would go on staking me. That's the sort of man\r\nhe is. But I wouldn't do it for a million Broadway successes. I've had\r\nmy chance, and I've foozled; and now I'm going back to make him happy\r\nby being a real live member of the firm. And the queer thing about it\r\nis that last night I hated the idea, and this morning, now that I've\r\ngot you, I almost look forward to it.'\r\n\r\nHe gave a little shiver.\r\n\r\n'And yet--I don't know. There's something rather gruesome still to my\r\nnear-artist soul in living in luxury on murdered piggies. Have you ever\r\nseen them persuading a pig to play the stellar role in a Boyd Premier\r\nBreakfast-Sausage? It's pretty ghastly. They string them up by their\r\nhind legs, and--b-r-r-r-r!'\r\n\r\n'Never mind,' said Elizabeth soothingly. 'Perhaps they don't mind it\r\nreally.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know,' said James Boyd, doubtfully. 'I've watched them\r\nat it, and I'm bound to say they didn't seem any too well pleased.'\r\n\r\n'Try not to think of it.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said James dutifully.\r\n\r\nThere came a sudden shout from the floor above, and on the heels of it\r\na shock-haired youth in pyjamas burst into the apartment.\r\n\r\n'Now what?' said James. 'By the way, Miss Herrold, my fiancee; Mr\r\nBriggs--Paul Axworthy Briggs, sometimes known as the Boy Novelist.\r\nWhat's troubling you, Paul?'\r\n\r\nMr Briggs was stammering with excitement.\r\n\r\n'Jimmy,' cried the Boy Novelist, 'what do you think has happened! A\r\nblack cat has just come into my apartment. I heard him mewing outside\r\nthe door, and opened it, and he streaked in. And I started my new novel\r\nlast night! Say, you _do_ believe this thing of black cats\r\nbringing luck, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'Luck! My lad, grapple that cat to your soul with hoops of steel. He's\r\nthe greatest little luck-bringer in New York. He was boarding with me\r\ntill this morning.'\r\n\r\n'Then--by Jove! I nearly forgot to ask--your play was a hit? I haven't\r\nseen the papers yet'\r\n\r\n'Well, when you see them, don't read the notices. It was the worst\r\nfrost Broadway has seen since Columbus's time.'\r\n\r\n'But--I don't understand.'\r\n\r\n'Don't worry. You don't have to. Go back and fill that cat with fish,\r\nor she'll be leaving you. I suppose you left the door open?'\r\n\r\n'My God!' said the Boy Novelist, paling, and dashed for the door.\r\n\r\n'Do you think Joseph _will_ bring him luck?' said Elizabeth,\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'It depends what sort of luck you mean. Joseph seems to work in devious\r\nways. If I know Joseph's methods, Briggs's new novel will be rejected\r\nby every publisher in the city; and then, when he is sitting in his\r\napartment, wondering which of his razors to end himself with, there\r\nwill be a ring at the bell, and in will come the most beautiful girl in\r\nthe world, and then--well, then, take it from me, he will be all\r\nright.'\r\n\r\n'He won't mind about the novel?'\r\n\r\n'Not in the least.'\r\n\r\n'Not even if it means that he will have to go away and kill pigs and\r\nthings.'\r\n\r\n'About the pig business, dear. I've noticed a slight tendency in you to\r\nlet yourself get rather morbid about it. I know they string them up by\r\nthe hind-legs, and all that sort of thing; but you must remember that a\r\npig looks at these things from a different standpoint. My belief is\r\nthat the pigs like it. Try not to think of it.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Elizabeth, dutifully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF AN UGLY POLICEMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nCrossing the Thames by Chelsea Bridge, the wanderer through London\r\nfinds himself in pleasant Battersea. Rounding the Park, where the\r\nfemale of the species wanders with its young by the ornamental water\r\nwhere the wild-fowl are, he comes upon a vast road. One side of this is\r\ngiven up to Nature, the other to Intellect. On the right, green trees\r\nstretch into the middle distance; on the left, endless blocks of\r\nresidential flats. It is Battersea Park Road, the home of the\r\ncliff-dwellers.\r\n\r\nPolice-constable Plimmer's beat embraced the first quarter of a mile of\r\nthe cliffs. It was his duty to pace in the measured fashion of the\r\nLondon policeman along the front of them, turn to the right, turn to\r\nthe left, and come back along the road which ran behind them. In this\r\nway he was enabled to keep the king's peace over no fewer than four\r\nblocks of mansions.\r\n\r\nIt did not require a deal of keeping. Battersea may have its tough\r\ncitizens, but they do not live in Battersea Park Road. Battersea Park\r\nRoad's speciality is Brain, not Crime. Authors, musicians, newspaper\r\nmen, actors, and artists are the inhabitants of these mansions. A child\r\ncould control them. They assault and batter nothing but pianos; they\r\nsteal nothing but ideas; they murder nobody except Chopin and\r\nBeethoven. Not through these shall an ambitious young constable achieve\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nAt this conclusion Edward Plimmer arrived within forty-eight hours of\r\nhis installation. He recognized the flats for what they were--just so\r\nmany layers of big-brained blamelessness. And there was not even the\r\nchance of a burglary. No burglar wastes his time burgling authors.\r\nConstable Plimmer reconciled his mind to the fact that his term in\r\nBattersea must be looked on as something in the nature of a vacation.\r\n\r\nHe was not altogether sorry. At first, indeed, he found the new\r\natmosphere soothing. His last beat had been in the heart of tempestuous\r\nWhitechapel, where his arms had ached from the incessant hauling of\r\nwiry inebriates to the station, and his shins had revolted at the kicks\r\nshowered upon them by haughty spirits impatient of restraint. Also, one\r\nSaturday night, three friends of a gentleman whom he was trying to\r\ninduce not to murder his wife had so wrought upon him that, when he\r\ncame out of hospital, his already homely appearance was further marred\r\nby a nose which resembled the gnarled root of a tree. All these things\r\nhad taken from the charm of Whitechapel, and the cloistral peace of\r\nBattersea Park Road was grateful and comforting.\r\n\r\nAnd just when the unbroken calm had begun to lose its attraction and\r\ndreams of action were once more troubling him, a new interest entered\r\nhis life; and with its coming he ceased to wish to be removed from\r\nBattersea. He fell in love.\r\n\r\nIt happened at the back of York Mansions. Anything that ever happened,\r\nhappened there; for it is at the back of these blocks of flats that the\r\nreal life is. At the front you never see anything, except an occasional\r\ntousle-headed young man smoking a pipe; but at the back, where the\r\ncooks come out to parley with the tradesmen, there is at certain hours\r\nof the day quite a respectable activity. Pointed dialogues about\r\nyesterday's eggs and the toughness of Saturday's meat are conducted\r\n_fortissimo_ between cheerful youths in the road and satirical\r\nyoung women in print dresses, who come out of their kitchen doors on to\r\nlittle balconies. The whole thing has a pleasing Romeo and Juliet\r\ntouch. Romeo rattles up in his cart. 'Sixty-four!' he cries.\r\n'Sixty-fower, sixty-fower, sixty-fow--' The kitchen door opens, and\r\nJuliet emerges. She eyes Romeo without any great show of affection.\r\n'Are you Perkins and Blissett?' she inquires coldly. Romeo admits it.\r\n'Two of them yesterday's eggs was bad.' Romeo protests. He defends his\r\neggs. They were fresh from the hen; he stood over her while she laid\r\nthem. Juliet listens frigidly. 'I _don't_ think,' she says. 'Well,\r\nhalf of sugar, one marmalade, and two of breakfast bacon,' she adds,\r\nand ends the argument. There is a rattling as of a steamer weighing\r\nanchor; the goods go up in the tradesman's lift; Juliet collects them,\r\nand exits, banging the door. The little drama is over.\r\n\r\nSuch is life at the back of York Mansions--a busy, throbbing thing.\r\n\r\nThe peace of afternoon had fallen upon the world one day towards the\r\nend of Constable Plimmer's second week of the simple life, when his\r\nattention was attracted by a whistle. It was followed by a musical\r\n'Hi!'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer looked up. On the kitchen balcony of a second-floor\r\nflat a girl was standing. As he took her in with a slow and exhaustive\r\ngaze, he was aware of strange thrills. There was something about this\r\ngirl which excited Constable Plimmer. I do not say that she was a\r\nbeauty; I do not claim that you or I would have raved about her; I\r\nmerely say that Constable Plimmer thought she was All Right.\r\n\r\n'Miss?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Got the time about you?' said the girl. 'All the clocks have stopped.'\r\n\r\n'The time,' said Constable Plimmer, consulting his watch, 'wants\r\nexactly ten minutes to four.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks.'\r\n\r\n'Not at all, miss.'\r\n\r\nThe girl was inclined for conversation. It was that gracious hour of\r\nthe day when you have cleared lunch and haven't got to think of dinner\r\nyet, and have a bit of time to draw a breath or two. She leaned over\r\nthe balcony and smiled pleasantly.\r\n\r\n'If you want to know the time, ask a pleeceman,' she said. 'You been on\r\nthis beat long?'\r\n\r\n'Just short of two weeks, miss.'\r\n\r\n'I been here three days.'\r\n\r\n'I hope you like it, miss.'\r\n\r\n'So-so. The milkman's a nice boy.'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer did not reply. He was busy silently hating the\r\nmilkman. He knew him--one of those good-looking blighters; one of those\r\noiled and curled perishers; one of those blooming fascinators who go\r\nabout the world making things hard for ugly, honest men with loving\r\nhearts. Oh, yes, he knew the milkman.\r\n\r\n'He's a rare one with his jokes,' said the girl.\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer went on not replying. He was perfectly aware that the\r\nmilkman was a rare one with his jokes. He had heard him. The way girls\r\nfell for anyone with the gift of the gab--that was what embittered\r\nConstable Plimmer.\r\n\r\n'He--' she giggled. 'He calls me Little Pansy-Face.'\r\n\r\n'If you'll excuse me, miss,' said Constable Plimmer coldly, 'I'll have\r\nto be getting along on my beat.'\r\n\r\nLittle Pansy-Face! And you couldn't arrest him for it! What a world!\r\nConstable Plimmer paced upon his way, a blue-clad volcano.\r\n\r\nIt is a terrible thing to be obsessed by a milkman. To Constable\r\nPlimmer's disordered imagination it seemed that, dating from this\r\ninterview, the world became one solid milkman. Wherever he went, he\r\nseemed to run into this milkman. If he was in the front road, this\r\nmilkman--Alf Brooks, it appeared, was his loathsome name--came rattling\r\npast with his jingling cans as if he were Apollo driving his chariot.\r\nIf he was round at the back, there was Alf, his damned tenor doing\r\nduets with the balconies. And all this in defiance of the known law of\r\nnatural history that milkmen do not come out after five in the morning.\r\nThis irritated Constable Plimmer. You talk of a man 'going home with\r\nthe milk' when you mean that he sneaks in in the small hours of the\r\nmorning. If all milkmen were like Alf Brooks the phrase was\r\nmeaningless.\r\n\r\nHe brooded. The unfairness of Fate was souring him. A man expects\r\ntrouble in his affairs of the heart from soldiers and sailors, and to\r\nbe cut out by even a postman is to fall before a worthy foe; but\r\nmilkmen--no! Only grocers' assistants and telegraph-boys were intended\r\nby Providence to fear milkmen.\r\n\r\nYet here was Alf Brooks, contrary to all rules, the established pet of\r\nthe mansions. Bright eyes shone from balconies when his 'Milk--oo--oo'\r\nsounded. Golden voices giggled delightedly at his bellowed chaff. And\r\nEllen Brown, whom he called Little Pansy-Face, was definitely in love\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThey were keeping company. They were walking out. This crushing truth\r\nEdward Plimmer learned from Ellen herself.\r\n\r\nShe had slipped out to mail a letter at the pillar-box on the corner,\r\nand she reached it just as the policeman arrived there in the course of\r\nhis patrol.\r\n\r\nNervousness impelled Constable Plimmer to be arch.\r\n\r\n''Ullo, 'ullo, 'ullo,' he said. 'Posting love-letters?'\r\n\r\n'What, me? This is to the Police Commissioner, telling him you're no\r\ngood.'\r\n\r\n'I'll give it to him. Him and me are taking supper tonight.'\r\n\r\nNature had never intended Constable Plimmer to be playful. He was at\r\nhis worst when he rollicked. He snatched at the letter with what was\r\nmeant to be a debonair gaiety, and only succeeded in looking like an\r\nangry gorilla. The girl uttered a startled squeak.\r\n\r\nThe letter was addressed to Mr A. Brooks.\r\n\r\nPlayfulness, after this, was at a discount. The girl was frightened and\r\nangry, and he was scowling with mingled jealousy and dismay.\r\n\r\n'Ho!' he said. 'Ho! Mr A. Brooks!'\r\n\r\nEllen Brown was a nice girl, but she had a temper, and there were\r\nmoments when her manners lacked rather noticeably the repose which\r\nstamps the caste of Vere de Vere.\r\n\r\n'Well, what about it?' she cried. 'Can't one write to the young\r\ngentleman one's keeping company with, without having to get permission\r\nfrom every--' She paused to marshal her forces from the assault.\r\n'Without having to get permission from every great, ugly, red-faced\r\ncopper with big feet and a broken nose in London?'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer's wrath faded into a dull unhappiness. Yes, she was\r\nright. That was the correct description. That was how an impartial\r\nScotland Yard would be compelled to describe him, if ever he got lost.\r\n'Missing. A great, ugly, red-faced copper with big feet and a broken\r\nnose.' They would never find him otherwise.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you object to my walking out with Alf? Perhaps you've got\r\nsomething against him? I suppose you're jealous!'\r\n\r\nShe threw in the last suggestion entirely in a sporting spirit. She\r\nloved battle, and she had a feeling that this one was going to finish\r\nfar too quickly. To prolong it, she gave him this opening. There were a\r\ndozen ways in which he might answer, each more insulting than the last;\r\nand then, when he had finished, she could begin again. These little\r\nencounters, she held, sharpened the wits, stimulated the circulation,\r\nand kept one out in the open air.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Constable Plimmer.\r\n\r\nIt was the one reply she was not expecting. For direct abuse, for\r\nsarcasm, for dignity, for almost any speech beginning, 'What! Jealous\r\nof you. Why--' she was prepared. But this was incredible. It disabled\r\nher, as the wild thrust of an unskilled fencer will disable a master of\r\nthe rapier. She searched in her mind and found that she had nothing to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nThere was a tense moment in which she found him, looking her in the\r\neyes, strangely less ugly than she had supposed, and then he was gone,\r\nrolling along on his beat with that air which all policemen must\r\nachieve, of having no feelings at all, and--as long as it behaves\r\nitself--no interest in the human race.\r\n\r\nEllen posted her letter. She dropped it into the box thoughtfully, and\r\nthoughtfully returned to the flat. She looked over her shoulder, but\r\nConstable Plimmer was out of sight.\r\n\r\nPeaceful Battersea began to vex Constable Plimmer. To a man crossed in\r\nlove, action is the one anodyne; and Battersea gave no scope for\r\naction. He dreamed now of the old Whitechapel days as a man dreams of\r\nthe joys of his childhood. He reflected bitterly that a fellow never\r\nknows when he is well off in this world. Any one of those myriad drunk\r\nand disorderlies would have been as balm to him now. He was like a man\r\nwho has run through a fortune and in poverty eats the bread of regret.\r\nAmazedly he recollected that in those happy days he had grumbled at his\r\nlot. He remembered confiding to a friend in the station-house, as he\r\nrubbed with liniment the spot on his right shin where the well-shod\r\nfoot of a joyous costermonger had got home, that this sort of\r\nthing--meaning militant costermongers--was 'a bit too thick'. A bit too\r\nthick! Why, he would pay one to kick him now. And as for the three\r\nloyal friends of the would-be wife-murderer who had broken his nose, if\r\nhe saw them coming round the corner he would welcome them as brothers.\r\n\r\nAnd Battersea Park Road dozed on--calm, intellectual, law-abiding.\r\n\r\nA friend of his told him that there had once been a murder in one of\r\nthese flats. He did not believe it. If any of these white-corpuscled\r\nclams ever swatted a fly, it was much as they could do. The thing was\r\nridiculous on the face of it. If they were capable of murder, they\r\nwould have murdered Alf Brooks.\r\n\r\nHe stood in the road, and looked up at the placid buildings\r\nresentfully.\r\n\r\n'Grr-rr-rr!' he growled, and kicked the side-walk.\r\n\r\nAnd, even as he spoke, on the balcony of a second-floor flat there\r\nappeared a woman, an elderly, sharp-faced woman, who waved her arms and\r\nscreamed, 'Policeman! Officer! Come up here! Come up here at once!'\r\n\r\nUp the stone stairs went Constable Plimmer at the run. His mind was\r\nalert and questioning. Murder? Hardly murder, perhaps. If it had been\r\nthat, the woman would have said so. She did not look the sort of woman\r\nwho would be reticent about a thing like that. Well, anyway, it was\r\nsomething; and Edward Plimmer had been long enough in Battersea to be\r\nthankful for small favours. An intoxicated husband would be better than\r\nnothing. At least he would be something that a fellow could get his\r\nhands on to and throw about a bit.\r\n\r\nThe sharp-faced woman was waiting for him at the door. He followed her\r\ninto the flat.\r\n\r\n'What is it, ma'am?'\r\n\r\n'Theft! Our cook has been stealing!'\r\n\r\nShe seemed sufficiently excited about it, but Constable Plimmer felt\r\nonly depression and disappointment. A stout admirer of the sex, he\r\nhated arresting women. Moreover, to a man in the mood to tackle\r\nanarchists with bombs, to be confronted with petty theft is galling.\r\nBut duty was duty. He produced his notebook.\r\n\r\n'She is in her room. I locked her in. I know she has taken my brooch.\r\nWe have missed money. You must search her.'\r\n\r\n'Can't do that, ma'am. Female searcher at the station.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you can search her box.'\r\n\r\nA little, bald, nervous man in spectacles appeared as if out of a trap.\r\nAs a matter of fact, he had been there all the time, standing by the\r\nbookcase; but he was one of those men you do not notice till they move\r\nand speak.\r\n\r\n'Er--Jane.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Henry?'\r\n\r\nThe little man seemed to swallow something.\r\n\r\n'I--I think that you may possibly be wronging Ellen. It is just\r\npossible, as regards the money--' He smiled in a ghastly manner and\r\nturned to the policeman. 'Er--officer, I ought to tell you that my\r\nwife--ah--holds the purse-strings of our little home; and it is just\r\npossible that in an absent-minded moment _I_ may have--'\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to tell me, Henry, that _you_ have been taking my\r\nmoney?'\r\n\r\n'My dear, it is just possible that in the abs--'\r\n\r\n'How often?'\r\n\r\nHe wavered perceptibly. Conscience was beginning to lose its grip.\r\n\r\n'Oh, not often.'\r\n\r\n'How often? More than once?'\r\n\r\nConscience had shot its bolt. The little man gave up the Struggle.\r\n\r\n'No, no, not more than once. Certainly not more than once.'\r\n\r\n'You ought not to have done it at all. We will talk about that later.\r\nIt doesn't alter the fact that Ellen is a thief. I have missed money\r\nhalf a dozen times. Besides that, there's the brooch. Step this way,\r\nofficer.'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer stepped that way--his face a mask. He knew who was\r\nwaiting for them behind the locked door at the end of the passage. But\r\nit was his duty to look as if he were stuffed, and he did so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on her bed, dressed for the street. It was her\r\nafternoon out, the sharp-faced woman had informed Constable Plimmer,\r\nattributing the fact that she had discovered the loss of the brooch in\r\ntime to stop her a direct interposition of Providence. She was pale,\r\nand there was a hunted look in her eyes.\r\n\r\n'You wicked girl, where is my brooch?'\r\n\r\nShe held it out without a word. She had been holding it in her hand.\r\n\r\n'You see, officer!'\r\n\r\n'I wasn't stealing of it. I 'adn't but borrowed it. I was going to put\r\nit back.'\r\n\r\n'Stuff and nonsense! Borrow it, indeed! What for?'\r\n\r\n'I--I wanted to look nice.'\r\n\r\nThe woman gave a short laugh. Constable Plimmer's face was a mere block\r\nof wood, expressionless.\r\n\r\n'And what about the money I've been missing? I suppose you'll say you\r\nonly borrowed that?'\r\n\r\n'I never took no money.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's gone, and money doesn't go by itself. Take her to the\r\npolice-station, officer.'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer raised heavy eyes.\r\n\r\n'You make a charge, ma'am?'\r\n\r\n'Bless the man! Of course I make a charge. What did you think I asked\r\nyou to step in for?'\r\n\r\n'Will you come along, miss?' said Constable Plimmer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut in the street the sun shone gaily down on peaceful Battersea. It\r\nwas the hour when children walk abroad with their nurses; and from the\r\ngreen depths of the Park came the sound of happy voices. A cat\r\nstretched itself in the sunshine and eyed the two as they passed with\r\nlazy content.\r\n\r\nThey walked in silence. Constable Plimmer was a man with a rigid sense\r\nof what was and what was not fitting behaviour in a policeman on duty:\r\nhe aimed always at a machine-like impersonality. There were times when\r\nit came hard, but he did his best. He strode on, his chin up and his\r\neyes averted. And beside him--\r\n\r\nWell, she was not crying. That was something.\r\n\r\nRound the corner, beautiful in light flannel, gay at both ends with a\r\nnew straw hat and the yellowest shoes in South-West London, scented,\r\ncurled, a prince among young men, stood Alf Brooks. He was feeling\r\npiqued. When he said three o'clock, he meant three o'clock. It was now\r\nthree-fifteen, and she had not appeared. Alf Brooks swore an impatient\r\noath, and the thought crossed his mind, as it had sometimes crossed it\r\nbefore, that Ellen Brown was not the only girl in the world.\r\n\r\n'Give her another five min--'\r\n\r\nEllen Brown, with escort, at that moment turned the corner.\r\n\r\nRage was the first emotion which the spectacle aroused in Alf Brooks.\r\nGirls who kept a fellow waiting about while they fooled around with\r\npolicemen were no girls for him. They could understand once and for all\r\nthat he was a man who could pick and choose.\r\n\r\nAnd then an electric shock set the world dancing mistily before his\r\neyes. This policeman was wearing his belt; he was on duty. And Ellen's\r\nface was not the face of a girl strolling with the Force for pleasure.\r\n\r\nHis heart stopped, and then began to race. His cheeks flushed a dusky\r\ncrimson. His jaw fell, and a prickly warmth glowed in the parts about\r\nhis spine.\r\n\r\n'Goo'!'\r\n\r\nHis fingers sought his collar.\r\n\r\n'Crumbs!'\r\n\r\nHe was hot all over.\r\n\r\n'Goo' Lor'! She's been pinched!'\r\n\r\nHe tugged at his collar. It was choking him.\r\n\r\nAlf Brooks did not show up well in the first real crisis which life had\r\nforced upon him. That must be admitted. Later, when it was over, and he\r\nhad leisure for self-examination, he admitted it to himself. But even\r\nthen he excused himself by asking Space in a blustering manner what\r\nelse he could ha' done. And if the question did not bring much balm to\r\nhis soul at the first time of asking, it proved wonderfully soothing on\r\nconstant repetition. He repeated it at intervals for the next two days,\r\nand by the end of that time his cure was complete. On the third morning\r\nhis 'Milk--oo--oo' had regained its customary carefree ring, and he was\r\nfeeling that he had acted in difficult circumstances in the only\r\npossible manner.\r\n\r\nConsider. He was Alf Brooks, well known and respected in the\r\nneighbourhood; a singer in the choir on Sundays; owner of a milk-walk\r\nin the most fashionable part of Battersea; to all practical purposes a\r\npublic man. Was he to recognize, in broad daylight and in open street,\r\na girl who walked with a policeman because she had to, a malefactor, a\r\ngirl who had been pinched?\r\n\r\nEllen, Constable Plimmer woodenly at her side, came towards him. She\r\nwas ten yards off--seven--five--three--Alf Brooks tilted his hat over\r\nhis eyes and walked past her, unseeing, a stranger.\r\n\r\nHe hurried on. He was conscious of a curious feeling that somebody was\r\njust going to kick him, but he dared not look round.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer eyed the middle distance with an earnest gaze. His\r\nface was redder than ever. Beneath his blue tunic strange emotions were\r\nat work. Something seemed to be filling his throat. He tried to swallow\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his stride. The girl glanced up at him in a kind of dull,\r\nquestioning way. Their eyes met for the first time that afternoon, and\r\nit seemed to Constable Plimmer that whatever it was that was\r\ninterfering with the inside of his throat had grown larger, and more\r\nunmanageable.\r\n\r\nThere was the misery of the stricken animal in her gaze. He had seen\r\nwomen look like that in Whitechapel. The woman to whom, indirectly, he\r\nowed his broken nose had looked like that. As his hand had fallen on\r\nthe collar of the man who was kicking her to death, he had seen her\r\neyes. They were Ellen's eyes, as she stood there now--tortured,\r\ncrushed, yet uncomplaining.\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer looked at Ellen, and Ellen looked at Constable\r\nPlimmer. Down the street some children were playing with a dog. In one\r\nof the flats a woman began to sing.\r\n\r\n'Hop it,' said Constable Plimmer.\r\n\r\nHe spoke gruffly. He found speech difficult.\r\n\r\nThe girl started.\r\n\r\n'What say?'\r\n\r\n'Hop it. Get along. Run away.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer scowled. His face was scarlet. His jaw protruded like\r\na granite break-water.\r\n\r\n'Go on,' he growled. 'Hop it. Tell him it was all a joke. I'll explain\r\nat the station.'\r\n\r\nUnderstanding seemed to come to her slowly.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean I'm to go?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean? You aren't going to take me to the station?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\nShe stared at him. Then, suddenly, she broke down,\r\n\r\n'He wouldn't look at me. He was ashamed of me. He pretended not to see\r\nme.'\r\n\r\nShe leaned against the wall, her back shaking.\r\n\r\n'Well, run after him, and tell him it was all--'\r\n\r\n'No, no, no.'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer looked morosely at the side-walk. He kicked it.\r\n\r\nShe turned. Her eyes were red, but she was no longer crying. Her chin\r\nhad a brave tilt.\r\n\r\n'I couldn't--not after what he did. Let's go along. I--I don't care.'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n'Were you really going to have let me go?'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer nodded. He was aware of her eyes searching his face,\r\nbut he did not meet them.\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.\r\n\r\n'What would have happened to you, if you had have done?'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer's scowl was of the stuff of which nightmares are\r\nmade. He kicked the unoffending side-walk with an increased\r\nviciousness.\r\n\r\n'Dismissed the Force,' he said curtly.\r\n\r\n'And sent to prison, too, I shouldn't wonder.'\r\n\r\n'Maybe.'\r\n\r\nHe heard her draw a deep breath, and silence fell upon them again. The\r\ndog down the road had stopped barking. The woman in the flat had\r\nstopped singing. They were curiously alone.\r\n\r\n'Would you have done all that for me?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Because I don't think you ever did it. Stole that money, I mean. Nor\r\nthe brooch, neither.'\r\n\r\n'Was that all?'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean--all?'\r\n\r\n'Was that the only reason?'\r\n\r\nHe swung round on her, almost threateningly.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said hoarsely. 'No, it wasn't, and you know it wasn't. Well,\r\nif you want it, you can have it. It was because I love you. There! Now\r\nI've said it, and now you can go on and laugh at me as much as you\r\nwant.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not laughing,' she said soberly.\r\n\r\n'You think I'm a fool!'\r\n\r\n'No, I don't.'\r\n\r\n'I'm nothing to you. _He's_ the fellow you're stuck on.'\r\n\r\nShe gave a little shudder.\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I've changed.' She paused. 'I think I shall have changed more by the\r\ntime I come out.'\r\n\r\n'Come out?'\r\n\r\n'Come out of prison.'\r\n\r\n'You're not going to prison.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I am.'\r\n\r\n'I won't take you.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you will. Think I'm going to let you get yourself in trouble like\r\nthat, to get me out of a fix? Not much.'\r\n\r\n'You hop it, like a good girl.'\r\n\r\n'Not me.'\r\n\r\nHe stood looking at her like a puzzled bear.\r\n\r\n'They can't eat me.'\r\n\r\n'They'll cut off all of your hair.'\r\n\r\n'D'you like my hair?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it'll grow again.'\r\n\r\n'Don't stand talking. Hop it.'\r\n\r\n'I won't. Where's the station?'\r\n\r\n'Next street.'\r\n\r\n'Well, come along, then.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe blue glass lamp of the police-station came into sight, and for an\r\ninstant she stopped. Then she was walking on again, her chin tilted.\r\nBut her voice shook a little as she spoke.\r\n\r\n'Nearly there. Next stop, Battersea. All change! I say, mister--I don't\r\nknow your name.'\r\n\r\n'Plimmer's my name, miss. Edward Plimmer.'\r\n\r\n'I wonder if--I mean it'll be pretty lonely where I'm going--I wonder\r\nif--What I mean is, it would be rather a lark, when I come out, if I\r\nwas to find a pal waiting for me to say \"Hallo\".'\r\n\r\nConstable Plimmer braced his ample feet against the stones, and turned\r\npurple.\r\n\r\n'Miss,' he said, 'I'll be there, if I have to sit up all night. The\r\nfirst thing you'll see when they open the doors is a great, ugly,\r\nred-faced copper with big feet and a broken nose. And if you'll say\r\n\"Hallo\" to him when he says \"Hallo\" to you, he'll be as pleased as\r\nPunch and as proud as a duke. And, miss'--he clenched his hands till\r\nthe nails hurt the leathern flesh--'and, miss, there's just one thing\r\nmore I'd like to say. You'll be having a good deal of time to yourself\r\nfor awhile; you'll be able to do a good bit of thinking without anyone\r\nto disturb you; and what I'd like you to give your mind to, if you\r\ndon't object, is just to think whether you can't forget that\r\nnarrow-chested, God-forsaken blighter who treated you so mean, and get\r\nhalf-way fond of someone who knows jolly well you're the only girl\r\nthere is.'\r\n\r\nShe looked past him at the lamp which hung, blue and forbidding, over\r\nthe station door.\r\n\r\n'How long'll I get?' she said. 'What will they give me? Thirty days?'\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n'It won't take me as long as that,' she said. 'I say, what do people\r\ncall you?--people who are fond of you, I mean?--Eddie or Ted?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SEA OF TROUBLES\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Meggs's mind was made up. He was going to commit suicide.\r\n\r\nThere had been moments, in the interval which had elapsed between the\r\nfirst inception of the idea and his present state of fixed\r\ndetermination, when he had wavered. In these moments he had debated,\r\nwith Hamlet, the question whether it was nobler in the mind to suffer,\r\nor to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them. But\r\nall that was over now. He was resolved.\r\n\r\nMr Meggs's point, the main plank, as it were, in his suicidal platform,\r\nwas that with him it was beside the question whether or not it was\r\nnobler to suffer in the mind. The mind hardly entered into it at all.\r\nWhat he had to decide was whether it was worth while putting up any\r\nlonger with the perfectly infernal pain in his stomach. For Mr Meggs\r\nwas a martyr to indigestion. As he was also devoted to the pleasures of\r\nthe table, life had become for him one long battle, in which, whatever\r\nhappened, he always got the worst of it.\r\n\r\nHe was sick of it. He looked back down the vista of the years, and\r\nfound therein no hope for the future. One after the other all the\r\npatent medicines in creation had failed him. Smith's Supreme Digestive\r\nPellets--he had given them a more than fair trial. Blenkinsop's Liquid\r\nLife-Giver--he had drunk enough of it to float a ship. Perkins's\r\nPremier Pain-Preventer, strongly recommended by the sword-swallowing\r\nlady at Barnum and Bailey's--he had wallowed in it. And so on down the\r\nlist. His interior organism had simply sneered at the lot of them.\r\n\r\n'Death, where is thy sting?' thought Mr Meggs, and forthwith began to\r\nmake his preparations.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied the matter say that the tendency to commit\r\nsuicide is greatest among those who have passed their fifty-fifth year,\r\nand that the rate is twice as great for unoccupied males as for\r\noccupied males. Unhappy Mr Meggs, accordingly, got it, so to speak,\r\nwith both barrels. He was fifty-six, and he was perhaps the most\r\nunoccupied adult to be found in the length and breadth of the United\r\nKingdom. He toiled not, neither did he spin. Twenty years before, an\r\nunexpected legacy had placed him in a position to indulge a natural\r\ntaste for idleness to the utmost. He was at that time, as regards his\r\nprofessional life, a clerk in a rather obscure shipping firm. Out of\r\noffice hours he had a mild fondness for letters, which took the form of\r\nmeaning to read right through the hundred best books one day, but\r\nactually contenting himself with the daily paper and an occasional\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nSuch was Mr Meggs at thirty-six. The necessity for working for a living\r\nand a salary too small to permit of self-indulgence among the more\r\nexpensive and deleterious dishes on the bill of fare had up to that\r\ntime kept his digestion within reasonable bounds. Sometimes he had\r\ntwinges; more often he had none.\r\n\r\nThen came the legacy, and with it Mr Meggs let himself go. He left\r\nLondon and retired to his native village, where, with a French cook and\r\na series of secretaries to whom he dictated at long intervals\r\noccasional paragraphs of a book on British Butterflies on which he\r\nimagined himself to be at work, he passed the next twenty years. He\r\ncould afford to do himself well, and he did himself extremely well.\r\nNobody urged him to take exercise, so he took no exercise. Nobody\r\nwarned him of the perils of lobster and welsh rabbits to a man of\r\nsedentary habits, for it was nobody's business to warn him. On the\r\ncontrary, people rather encouraged the lobster side of his character,\r\nfor he was a hospitable soul and liked to have his friends dine with\r\nhim. The result was that Nature, as is her wont, laid for him, and got\r\nhim. It seemed to Mr Meggs that he woke one morning to find himself a\r\nchronic dyspeptic. That was one of the hardships of his position, to\r\nhis mind. The thing seemed to hit him suddenly out of a blue sky. One\r\nmoment, all appeared to be peace and joy; the next, a lively and\r\nirritable wild-cat with red-hot claws seemed somehow to have introduced\r\nitself into his interior.\r\n\r\nSo Mr Meggs decided to end it.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis of his life the old methodical habits of his youth\r\nreturned to him. A man cannot be a clerk in even an obscure firm of\r\nshippers for a great length of time without acquiring system, and Mr\r\nMeggs made his preparations calmly and with a forethought worthy of a\r\nbetter cause.\r\n\r\nAnd so we find him, one glorious June morning, seated at his desk,\r\nready for the end.\r\n\r\nOutside, the sun beat down upon the orderly streets of the village.\r\nDogs dozed in the warm dust. Men who had to work went about their toil\r\nmoistly, their minds far away in shady public-houses.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Meggs, in his study, was cool both in mind and body.\r\n\r\nBefore him, on the desk, lay six little slips of paper. They were\r\nbank-notes, and they represented, with the exception of a few pounds,\r\nhis entire worldly wealth. Beside them were six letters, six envelopes,\r\nand six postage stamps. Mr Meggs surveyed them calmly.\r\n\r\nHe would not have admitted it, but he had had a lot of fun writing\r\nthose letters. The deliberation as to who should be his heirs had\r\noccupied him pleasantly for several days, and, indeed, had taken his\r\nmind off his internal pains at times so thoroughly that he had\r\nfrequently surprised himself in an almost cheerful mood. Yes, he would\r\nhave denied it, but it had been great sport sitting in his arm-chair,\r\nthinking whom he should pick out from England's teeming millions to\r\nmake happy with his money. All sorts of schemes had passed through his\r\nmind. He had a sense of power which the mere possession of the money\r\nhad never given him. He began to understand why millionaires make freak\r\nwills. At one time he had toyed with the idea of selecting someone at\r\nrandom from the London Directory and bestowing on him all he had to\r\nbequeath. He had only abandoned the scheme when it occurred to him that\r\nhe himself would not be in a position to witness the recipient's\r\nstunned delight. And what was the good of starting a thing like that,\r\nif you were not to be in at the finish?\r\n\r\nSentiment succeeded whimsicality. His old friends of the office--those\r\nwere the men to benefit. What good fellows they had been! Some were\r\ndead, but he still kept intermittently in touch with half a dozen of\r\nthem. And--an important point--he knew their present addresses.\r\n\r\nThis point was important, because Mr Meggs had decided not to leave a\r\nwill, but to send the money direct to the beneficiaries. He knew what\r\nwills were. Even in quite straightforward circumstances they often made\r\ntrouble. There had been some slight complication about his own legacy\r\ntwenty years ago. Somebody had contested the will, and before the thing\r\nwas satisfactorily settled the lawyers had got away with about twenty\r\nper cent of the whole. No, no wills. If he made one, and then killed\r\nhimself, it might be upset on a plea of insanity. He knew of no\r\nrelative who might consider himself entitled to the money, but there\r\nwas the chance that some remote cousin existed; and then the comrades\r\nof his youth might fail to collect after all.\r\n\r\nHe declined to run the risk. Quietly and by degrees he had sold out the\r\nstocks and shares in which his fortune was invested, and deposited the\r\nmoney in his London bank. Six piles of large notes, dividing the total\r\ninto six equal parts; six letters couched in a strain of reminiscent\r\npathos and manly resignation; six envelopes, legibly addressed; six\r\npostage-stamps; and that part of his preparations was complete. He\r\nlicked the stamps and placed them on the envelopes; took the notes and\r\ninserted them in the letters; folded the letters and thrust them into\r\nthe envelopes; sealed the envelopes; and unlocking the drawer of his\r\ndesk produced a small, black, ugly-looking bottle.\r\n\r\nHe opened the bottle and poured the contents into a medicine-glass.\r\n\r\nIt had not been without considerable thought that Mr Meggs had decided\r\nupon the method of his suicide. The knife, the pistol, the rope--they\r\nhad all presented their charms to him. He had further examined the\r\nmerits of drowning and of leaping to destruction from a height.\r\n\r\nThere were flaws in each. Either they were painful, or else they were\r\nmessy. Mr Meggs had a tidy soul, and he revolted from the thought of\r\nspoiling his figure, as he would most certainly do if he drowned\r\nhimself; or the carpet, as he would if he used the pistol; or the\r\npavement--and possibly some innocent pedestrian, as must infallibly\r\noccur should he leap off the Monument. The knife was out of the\r\nquestion. Instinct told him that it would hurt like the very dickens.\r\n\r\nNo; poison was the thing. Easy to take, quick to work, and on the whole\r\nrather agreeable than otherwise.\r\n\r\nMr Meggs hid the glass behind the inkpot and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n'Has Miss Pillenger arrived?' he inquired of the servant.\r\n\r\n'She has just come, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Tell her that I am waiting for her here.'\r\n\r\nJane Pillenger was an institution. Her official position was that of\r\nprivate secretary and typist to Mr Meggs. That is to say, on the rare\r\noccasions when Mr Meggs's conscience overcame his indolence to the\r\nextent of forcing him to resume work on his British Butterflies, it was\r\nto Miss Pillenger that he addressed the few rambling and incoherent\r\nremarks which constituted his idea of a regular hard, slogging spell of\r\nliterary composition. When he sank back in his chair, speechless and\r\nexhausted like a Marathon runner who has started his sprint a mile or\r\ntwo too soon, it was Miss Pillenger's task to unscramble her shorthand\r\nnotes, type them neatly, and place them in their special drawer in the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nMiss Pillenger was a wary spinster of austere views, uncertain age, and\r\na deep-rooted suspicion of men--a suspicion which, to do an abused sex\r\njustice, they had done nothing to foster. Men had always been almost\r\ncoldly correct in their dealings with Miss Pillenger. In her twenty\r\nyears of experience as a typist and secretary she had never had to\r\nrefuse with scorn and indignation so much as a box of chocolates from\r\nany of her employers. Nevertheless, she continued to be icily on her\r\nguard. The clenched fist of her dignity was always drawn back, ready to\r\nswing on the first male who dared to step beyond the bounds of\r\nprofessional civility.\r\n\r\nSuch was Miss Pillenger. She was the last of a long line of unprotected\r\nEnglish girlhood which had been compelled by straitened circumstances\r\nto listen for hire to the appallingly dreary nonsense which Mr Meggs\r\nhad to impart on the subject of British Butterflies. Girls had come,\r\nand girls had gone, blondes, ex-blondes, brunettes, ex-brunettes,\r\nnear-blondes, near-brunettes; they had come buoyant, full of hope and\r\nlife, tempted by the lavish salary which Mr Meggs had found himself\r\nafter a while compelled to pay; and they had dropped off, one after\r\nanother, like exhausted bivalves, unable to endure the crushing boredom\r\nof life in the village which had given Mr Meggs to the world. For Mr\r\nMeggs's home-town was no City of Pleasure. Remove the Vicar's\r\nmagic-lantern and the try-your-weight machine opposite the post office,\r\nand you practically eliminated the temptations to tread the primrose\r\npath. The only young men in the place were silent, gaping youths, at\r\nwhom lunacy commissioners looked sharply and suspiciously when they\r\nmet. The tango was unknown, and the one-step. The only form of dance\r\nextant--and that only at the rarest intervals--was a sort of polka not\r\nunlike the movements of a slightly inebriated boxing kangaroo. Mr\r\nMeggs's secretaries and typists gave the town one startled, horrified\r\nglance, and stampeded for London like frightened ponies.\r\n\r\nNot so Miss Pillenger. She remained. She was a business woman, and it\r\nwas enough for her that she received a good salary. For five pounds a\r\nweek she would have undertaken a post as secretary and typist to a\r\nPolar Expedition. For six years she had been with Mr Meggs, and\r\ndoubtless she looked forward to being with him at least six years more.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the pathos of this thought which touched Mr Meggs, as\r\nshe sailed, notebook in hand, through the doorway of the study. Here,\r\nhe told himself, was a confiding girl, all unconscious of impending\r\ndoom, relying on him as a daughter relies on her father. He was glad\r\nthat he had not forgotten Miss Pillenger when he was making his\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nHe had certainly not forgotten Miss Pillenger. On his desk beside the\r\nletters lay a little pile of notes, amounting in all to five hundred\r\npounds--her legacy.\r\n\r\nMiss Pillenger was always business-like. She sat down in her chair,\r\nopened her notebook, moistened her pencil, and waited expectantly for\r\nMr Meggs to clear his throat and begin work on the butterflies. She was\r\nsurprised when, instead of frowning, as was his invariable practice\r\nwhen bracing himself for composition, he bestowed upon her a sweet,\r\nslow smile.\r\n\r\nAll that was maidenly and defensive in Miss Pillenger leaped to arms\r\nunder that smile. It ran in and out among her nerve-centres. It had\r\nbeen long in arriving, this moment of crisis, but here it undoubtedly\r\nwas at last. After twenty years an employer was going to court disaster\r\nby trying to flirt with her.\r\n\r\nMr Meggs went on smiling. You cannot classify smiles. Nothing lends\r\nitself so much to a variety of interpretations as a smile. Mr Meggs\r\nthought he was smiling the sad, tender smile of a man who, knowing\r\nhimself to be on the brink of the tomb, bids farewell to a faithful\r\nemployee. Miss Pillenger's view was that he was smiling like an\r\nabandoned old rip who ought to have been ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n'No, Miss Pillenger,' said Mr Meggs, 'I shall not work this morning. I\r\nshall want you, if you will be so good, to post these six letters for\r\nme.'\r\n\r\nMiss Pillenger took the letters. Mr Meggs surveyed her tenderly.\r\n\r\n'Miss Pillenger, you have been with me a long time now. Six years, is\r\nit not? Six years. Well, well. I don't think I have ever made you a\r\nlittle present, have I?'\r\n\r\n'You give me a good salary.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but I want to give you something more. Six years is a long time.\r\nI have come to regard you with a different feeling from that which the\r\nordinary employer feels for his secretary. You and I have worked\r\ntogether for six long years. Surely I may be permitted to give you some\r\ntoken of my appreciation of your fidelity.' He took the pile of notes.\r\n'These are for you, Miss Pillenger.'\r\n\r\nHe rose and handed them to her. He eyed her for a moment with all the\r\nsentimentality of a man whose digestion has been out of order for over\r\ntwo decades. The pathos of the situation swept him away. He bent over\r\nMiss Pillenger, and kissed her on the forehead.\r\n\r\nSmiles excepted, there is nothing so hard to classify as a kiss. Mr\r\nMeggs's notion was that he kissed Miss Pillenger much as some great\r\ngeneral, wounded unto death, might have kissed his mother, his sister,\r\nor some particularly sympathetic aunt; Miss Pillenger's view, differing\r\nsubstantially from this, may be outlined in her own words.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' she cried, as, dealing Mr Meggs's conveniently placed jaw a blow\r\nwhich, had it landed an inch lower down, might have knocked him out,\r\nshe sprang to her feet. 'How dare you! I've been waiting for this Mr\r\nMeggs. I have seen it in your eye. I have expected it. Let me tell you\r\nthat I am not at all the sort of girl with whom it is safe to behave\r\nlike that. I can protect myself. I am only a working-girl--'\r\n\r\nMr Meggs, who had fallen back against the desk as a stricken pugilist\r\nfalls on the ropes, pulled himself together to protest.\r\n\r\n'Miss Pillenger,' he cried, aghast, 'you misunderstand me. I had no\r\nintention--'\r\n\r\n'Misunderstand you? Bah! I am only a working-girl--'\r\n\r\n'Nothing was farther from my mind--'\r\n\r\n'Indeed! Nothing was farther from your mind! You give me money, you\r\nshower your vile kisses on me, but nothing was farther from your mind\r\nthan the obvious interpretation of such behaviour!' Before coming to Mr\r\nMeggs, Miss Pillenger had been secretary to an Indiana novelist. She\r\nhad learned style from the master. 'Now that you have gone too far, you\r\nare frightened at what you have done. You well may be, Mr Meggs. I am\r\nonly a working-girl--'\r\n\r\n'Miss Pillenger, I implore you--'\r\n\r\n'Silence! I am only a working-girl--'\r\n\r\nA wave of mad fury swept over Mr Meggs. The shock of the blow and still\r\nmore of the frightful ingratitude of this horrible woman nearly made\r\nhim foam at the mouth.\r\n\r\n'Don't keep on saying you're only a working-girl,' he bellowed. 'You'll\r\ndrive me mad. Go. Go away from me. Get out. Go anywhere, but leave me\r\nalone!'\r\n\r\nMiss Pillenger was not entirely sorry to obey the request. Mr Meggs's\r\nsudden fury had startled and frightened her. So long as she could end\r\nthe scene victorious, she was anxious to withdraw.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I will go,' she said, with dignity, as she opened the door. 'Now\r\nthat you have revealed yourself in your true colours, Mr Meggs, this\r\nhouse is no fit place for a wor--'\r\n\r\nShe caught her employer's eye, and vanished hastily.\r\n\r\nMr Meggs paced the room in a ferment. He had been shaken to his core by\r\nthe scene. He boiled with indignation. That his kind thoughts should\r\nhave been so misinterpreted--it was too much. Of all ungrateful worlds,\r\nthis world was the most--\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly in his stride, partly because his shin had struck a\r\nchair, partly because an idea had struck his mind.\r\n\r\nHopping madly, he added one more parallel between himself and Hamlet by\r\nsoliloquizing aloud.\r\n\r\n'I'll be hanged if I commit suicide,' he yelled.\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke the words a curious peace fell on him, as on a man who\r\nhas awakened from a nightmare. He sat down at the desk. What an idiot\r\nhe had been ever to contemplate self-destruction. What could have\r\ninduced him to do it? By his own hand to remove himself, merely in\r\norder that a pack of ungrateful brutes might wallow in his money--it\r\nwas the scheme of a perfect fool.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn't commit suicide. Not if he knew it. He would stick on and\r\nlaugh at them. And if he did have an occasional pain inside, what of\r\nthat? Napoleon had them, and look at him. He would be blowed if he\r\ncommitted suicide.\r\n\r\nWith the fire of a new resolve lighting up his eyes, he turned to seize\r\nthe six letters and rifle them of their contents.\r\n\r\nThey were gone.\r\n\r\nIt took Mr Meggs perhaps thirty seconds to recollect where they had\r\ngone to, and then it all came back to him. He had given them to the\r\ndemon Pillenger, and, if he did not overtake her and get them back, she\r\nwould mail them.\r\n\r\nOf all the mixed thoughts which seethed in Mr Meggs's mind at that\r\nmoment, easily the most prominent was the reflection that from his\r\nfront door to the post office was a walk of less than five minutes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Pillenger walked down the sleepy street in the June sunshine,\r\nboiling, as Mr Meggs had done, with indignation. She, too, had been\r\nshaken to the core. It was her intention to fulfil her duty by posting\r\nthe letters which had been entrusted to her, and then to quit for ever\r\nthe service of one who, for six years a model employer, had at last\r\nforgotten himself and showed his true nature.\r\n\r\nHer meditations were interrupted by a hoarse shout in her rear; and,\r\nturning, she perceived the model employer running rapidly towards her.\r\nHis face was scarlet, his eyes wild, and he wore no hat.\r\n\r\nMiss Pillenger's mind worked swiftly. She took in the situation in a\r\nflash. Unrequited, guilty love had sapped Mr Meggs's reason, and she\r\nwas to be the victim of his fury. She had read of scores of similar\r\ncases in the newspapers. How little she had ever imagined that she\r\nwould be the heroine of one of these dramas of passion.\r\n\r\nShe looked for one brief instant up and down the street. Nobody was in\r\nsight. With a loud cry she began to run.\r\n\r\n'Stop!'\r\n\r\nIt was the fierce voice of her pursuer. Miss Pillenger increased to\r\nthird speed. As she did so, she had a vision of headlines.\r\n\r\n'Stop!' roared Mr Meggs.\r\n\r\n'UNREQUITED PASSION MADE THIS MAN MURDERER,' thought Miss Pillenger.\r\n\r\n'Stop!'\r\n\r\n'CRAZED WITH LOVE HE SLAYS BEAUTIFUL BLONDE,' flashed out in letters of\r\ncrimson on the back of Miss Pillenger's mind.\r\n\r\n'Stop!'\r\n\r\n'SPURNED, HE STABS HER THRICE.'\r\n\r\nTo touch the ground at intervals of twenty yards or so--that was the\r\nideal she strove after. She addressed herself to it with all the\r\nstrength of her powerful mind.\r\n\r\nIn London, New York, Paris, and other cities where life is brisk, the\r\nspectacle of a hatless gentleman with a purple face pursuing his\r\nsecretary through the streets at a rapid gallop would, of course, have\r\nexcited little, if any, remark. But in Mr Meggs's home-town events were\r\nof rarer occurrence. The last milestone in the history of his native\r\nplace had been the visit, two years before, of Bingley's Stupendous\r\nCircus, which had paraded along the main street on its way to the next\r\ntown, while zealous members of its staff visited the back premises of\r\nthe houses and removed all the washing from the lines. Since then deep\r\npeace had reigned.\r\n\r\nGradually, therefore, as the chase warmed up, citizens of all shapes\r\nand sizes began to assemble. Miss Pillenger's screams and the general\r\nappearance of Mr Meggs gave food for thought. Having brooded over the\r\nsituation, they decided at length to take a hand, with the result that\r\nas Mr Meggs's grasp fell upon Miss Pillenger the grasp of several of\r\nhis fellow-townsmen fell upon him.\r\n\r\n'Save me!' said Miss Pillenger.\r\n\r\nMr Meggs pointed speechlessly to the letters, which she still grasped\r\nin her right hand. He had taken practically no exercise for twenty\r\nyears, and the pace had told upon him.\r\n\r\nConstable Gooch, guardian of the town's welfare, tightened his hold on\r\nMr Meggs's arm, and desired explanations.\r\n\r\n'He--he was going to murder me,' said Miss Pillenger.\r\n\r\n'Kill him,' advised an austere bystander.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean you were going to murder the lady?' inquired\r\nConstable Gooch.\r\n\r\nMr Meggs found speech.\r\n\r\n'I--I--I--I only wanted those letters.'\r\n\r\n'What for?'\r\n\r\n'They're mine.'\r\n\r\n'You charge her with stealing 'em?'\r\n\r\n'He gave them me to post with his own hands,' cried Miss Pillenger.\r\n\r\n'I know I did, but I want them back.'\r\n\r\nBy this time the constable, though age had to some extent dimmed his\r\nsight, had recognized beneath the perspiration, features which, though\r\nthey were distorted, were nevertheless those of one whom he respected\r\nas a leading citizen.\r\n\r\n'Why, Mr Meggs!' he said.\r\n\r\nThis identification by one in authority calmed, if it a little\r\ndisappointed, the crowd. What it was they did not know, but, it was\r\napparently not a murder, and they began to drift off.\r\n\r\n'Why don't you give Mr Meggs his letters when he asks you, ma'am?' said\r\nthe constable.\r\n\r\nMiss Pillenger drew herself up haughtily.\r\n\r\n'Here are your letters, Mr Meggs, I hope we shall never meet again.'\r\n\r\nMr Meggs nodded. That was his view, too.\r\n\r\nAll things work together for good. The following morning Mr Meggs awoke\r\nfrom a dreamless sleep with a feeling that some curious change had\r\ntaken place in him. He was abominably stiff, and to move his limbs was\r\npain, but down in the centre of his being there was a novel sensation\r\nof lightness. He could have declared that he was happy.\r\n\r\nWincing, he dragged himself out of bed and limped to the window. He\r\nthrew it open. It was a perfect morning. A cool breeze smote his face,\r\nbringing with it pleasant scents and the soothing sound of God's\r\ncreatures beginning a new day.\r\n\r\nAn astounding thought struck him.\r\n\r\n'Why, I feel well!'\r\n\r\nThen another.\r\n\r\n'It must be the exercise I took yesterday. By George, I'll do it\r\nregularly.'\r\n\r\nHe drank in the air luxuriously. Inside him, the wild-cat gave him a\r\nsudden claw, but it was a half-hearted effort, the effort of one who\r\nknows that he is beaten. Mr Meggs was so absorbed in his thoughts that\r\nhe did not even notice it.\r\n\r\n'London,' he was saying to himself. 'One of these physical culture\r\nplaces.... Comparatively young man.... Put myself in their hands....\r\nMild, regular exercise....'\r\n\r\nHe limped to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WITH TWO LEFT FEET\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents of the folk-lore of the United States of America are no doubt\r\nfamiliar with the quaint old story of Clarence MacFadden. Clarence\r\nMacFadden, it seems, was 'wishful to dance, but his feet wasn't gaited\r\nthat way. So he sought a professor and asked him his price, and said he\r\nwas willing to pay. The professor' (the legend goes on) 'looked down\r\nwith alarm at his feet and marked their enormous expanse; and he tacked\r\non a five to his regular price for teaching MacFadden to dance.'\r\n\r\nI have often been struck by the close similarity between the case of\r\nClarence and that of Henry Wallace Mills. One difference alone presents\r\nitself. It would seem to have been mere vanity and ambition that\r\nstimulated the former; whereas the motive force which drove Henry Mills\r\nto defy Nature and attempt dancing was the purer one of love. He did it\r\nto please his wife. Had he never gone to Ye Bonnie Briar-Bush Farm,\r\nthat popular holiday resort, and there met Minnie Hill, he would\r\ndoubtless have continued to spend in peaceful reading the hours not\r\ngiven over to work at the New York bank at which he was employed as\r\npaying-cashier. For Henry was a voracious reader. His idea of a\r\npleasant evening was to get back to his little flat, take off his coat,\r\nput on his slippers, light a pipe, and go on from the point where he\r\nhad left off the night before in his perusal of the BIS-CAL volume of\r\nthe _Encyclopaedia Britannica_--making notes as he read in a stout\r\nnotebook. He read the BIS-CAL volume because, after many days, he had\r\nfinished the A-AND, AND-AUS, and the AUS-BIS. There was something\r\nadmirable--and yet a little horrible--about Henry's method of study. He\r\nwent after Learning with the cold and dispassionate relentlessness of a\r\nstoat pursuing a rabbit. The ordinary man who is paying instalments on\r\nthe _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ is apt to get over-excited and to\r\nskip impatiently to Volume XXVIII (VET-ZYM) to see how it all comes out\r\nin the end. Not so Henry. His was not a frivolous mind. He intended to\r\nread the _Encyclopaedia_ through, and he was not going to spoil\r\nhis pleasure by peeping ahead.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be an inexorable law of Nature that no man shall shine\r\nat both ends. If he has a high forehead and a thirst for wisdom, his\r\nfox-trotting (if any) shall be as the staggerings of the drunken;\r\nwhile, if he is a good dancer, he is nearly always petrified from the\r\nears upward. No better examples of this law could have been found than\r\nHenry Mills and his fellow-cashier, Sidney Mercer. In New York banks\r\npaying-cashiers, like bears, tigers, lions, and other fauna, are always\r\nshut up in a cage in pairs, and are consequently dependent on each\r\nother for entertainment and social intercourse when business is slack.\r\nHenry Mills and Sidney simply could not find a subject in common.\r\nSidney knew absolutely nothing of even such elementary things as Abana,\r\nAberration, Abraham, or Acrogenae; while Henry, on his side, was\r\nscarcely aware that there had been any developments in the dance since\r\nthe polka. It was a relief to Henry when Sidney threw up his job to\r\njoin the chorus of a musical comedy, and was succeeded by a man who,\r\nthough full of limitations, could at least converse intelligently on\r\nBowls.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was Henry Wallace Mills. He was in the middle thirties,\r\ntemperate, studious, a moderate smoker, and--one would have said--a\r\nbachelor of the bachelors, armour-plated against Cupid's well-meant but\r\nobsolete artillery. Sometimes Sidney Mercer's successor in the teller's\r\ncage, a sentimental young man, would broach the topic of Woman and\r\nMarriage. He would ask Henry if he ever intended to get married. On\r\nsuch occasions Henry would look at him in a manner which was a blend of\r\nscorn, amusement, and indignation; and would reply with a single word:\r\n\r\n'Me!'\r\n\r\nIt was the way he said it that impressed you.\r\n\r\nBut Henry had yet to experience the unmanning atmosphere of a lonely\r\nsummer resort. He had only just reached the position in the bank where\r\nhe was permitted to take his annual vacation in the summer. Hitherto he\r\nhad always been released from his cage during the winter months, and\r\nhad spent his ten days of freedom at his flat, with a book in his hand\r\nand his feet on the radiator. But the summer after Sidney Mercer's\r\ndeparture they unleashed him in August.\r\n\r\nIt was meltingly warm in the city. Something in Henry cried out for the\r\ncountry. For a month before the beginning of his vacation he devoted\r\nmuch of the time that should have been given to the _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_ in reading summer-resort literature. He decided at\r\nlength upon Ye Bonnie Briar-Bush Farm because the advertisements spoke\r\nso well of it.\r\n\r\nYe Bonnie Briar-Bush Farm was a rather battered frame building many\r\nmiles from anywhere. Its attractions included a Lovers' Leap, a Grotto,\r\ngolf-links--a five-hole course where the enthusiast found unusual\r\nhazards in the shape of a number of goats tethered at intervals between\r\nthe holes--and a silvery lake, only portions of which were used as a\r\ndumping-ground for tin cans and wooden boxes. It was all new and\r\nstrange to Henry and caused him an odd exhilaration. Something of\r\ngaiety and reckless abandon began to creep into his veins. He had a\r\ncurious feeling that in these romantic surroundings some adventure\r\nought to happen to him.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Minnie Hill arrived. She was a small, slim girl,\r\nthinner and paler than she should have been, with large eyes that\r\nseemed to Henry pathetic and stirred his chivalry. He began to think a\r\ngood deal about Minnie Hill.\r\n\r\nAnd then one evening he met her on the shores of the silvery lake. He\r\nwas standing there, slapping at things that looked like mosquitoes, but\r\ncould not have been, for the advertisements expressly stated that none\r\nwere ever found in the neighbourhood of Ye Bonnie Briar-Bush Farm, when\r\nalong she came. She walked slowly, as if she were tired. A strange\r\nthrill, half of pity, half of something else, ran through Henry. He\r\nlooked at her. She looked at him.\r\n\r\n'Good evening,' he said.\r\n\r\nThey were the first words he had spoken to her. She never contributed\r\nto the dialogue of the dining-room, and he had been too shy to seek her\r\nout in the open.\r\n\r\nShe said 'Good evening,' too, tying the score. And there was silence\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\nCommiseration overcame Henry's shyness.\r\n\r\n'You're looking tired,' he said.\r\n\r\n'I feel tired.' She paused. 'I overdid it in the city.'\r\n\r\n'It?'\r\n\r\n'Dancing.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, dancing. Did you dance much?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; a great deal.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!'\r\n\r\nA promising, even a dashing start. But how to continue? For the first\r\ntime Henry regretted the steady determination of his methods with the\r\n_Encyclopaedia_. How pleasant if he could have been in a position\r\nto talk easily of Dancing. Then memory reminded him that, though he had\r\nnot yet got up to Dancing, it was only a few weeks before that he had\r\nbeen reading of the Ballet.\r\n\r\n'I don't dance myself,' he said, 'but I am fond of reading about it.\r\nDid you know that the word \"ballet\" incorporated three distinct modern\r\nwords, \"ballet\", \"ball\", and \"ballad\", and that ballet-dancing was\r\noriginally accompanied by singing?'\r\n\r\nIt hit her. It had her weak. She looked at him with awe in her eyes.\r\nOne might almost say that she gaped at Henry.\r\n\r\n'I hardly know anything,' she said.\r\n\r\n'The first descriptive ballet seen in London, England,' said Henry,\r\nquietly, 'was \"The Tavern Bilkers\", which was played at Drury Lane\r\nin--in seventeen--something.'\r\n\r\n'Was it?'\r\n\r\n'And the earliest modern ballet on record was that given by--by someone\r\nto celebrate the marriage of the Duke of Milan in 1489.'\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt or hesitation about the date this time. It was\r\ngrappled to his memory by hoops of steel owing to the singular\r\ncoincidence of it being also his telephone number. He gave it out with\r\na roll, and the girl's eyes widened.\r\n\r\n'What an awful lot you know!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no,' said Henry, modestly. 'I read a great deal.'\r\n\r\n'It must be splendid to know a lot,' she said, wistfully. 'I've never\r\nhad time for reading. I've always wanted to. I think you're wonderful!'\r\n\r\nHenry's soul was expanding like a flower and purring like a\r\nwell-tickled cat. Never in his life had he been admired by a woman. The\r\nsensation was intoxicating.\r\n\r\nSilence fell upon them. They started to walk back to the farm, warned\r\nby the distant ringing of a bell that supper was about to materialize.\r\nIt was not a musical bell, but distance and the magic of this unusual\r\nmoment lent it charm. The sun was setting. It threw a crimson carpet\r\nacross the silvery lake. The air was very still. The creatures,\r\nunclassified by science, who might have been mistaken for mosquitoes\r\nhad their presence been possible at Ye Bonnie Briar-Bush Farm, were\r\nbiting harder than ever. But Henry heeded them not. He did not even\r\nslap at them. They drank their fill of his blood and went away to put\r\ntheir friends on to this good thing; but for Henry they did not exist.\r\nStrange things were happening to him. And, lying awake that night in\r\nbed, he recognized the truth. He was in love.\r\n\r\nAfter that, for the remainder of his stay, they were always together.\r\nThey walked in the woods, they sat by the silvery lake. He poured out\r\nthe treasures of his learning for her, and she looked at him with\r\nreverent eyes, uttering from time to time a soft 'Yes' or a musical\r\n'Gee!'\r\n\r\nIn due season Henry went back to New York.\r\n\r\n'You're dead wrong about love, Mills,' said his sentimental\r\nfellow-cashier, shortly after his return. 'You ought to get married.'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to,' replied Henry, briskly. 'Week tomorrow.'\r\n\r\nWhich stunned the other so thoroughly that he gave a customer who\r\nentered at that moment fifteen dollars for a ten-dollar cheque, and had\r\nto do some excited telephoning after the bank had closed.\r\n\r\nHenry's first year as a married man was the happiest of his life. He\r\nhad always heard this period described as the most perilous of\r\nmatrimony. He had braced himself for clashings of tastes, painful\r\nadjustments of character, sudden and unavoidable quarrels. Nothing of\r\nthe kind happened. From the very beginning they settled down in perfect\r\nharmony. She merged with his life as smoothly as one river joins\r\nanother. He did not even have to alter his habits. Every morning he had\r\nhis breakfast at eight, smoked a cigarette, and walked to the\r\nUnderground. At five he left the bank, and at six he arrived home, for\r\nit was his practice to walk the first two miles of the way, breathing\r\ndeeply and regularly. Then dinner. Then the quiet evening. Sometimes\r\nthe moving-pictures, but generally the quiet evening, he reading the\r\n_Encyclopaedia_--aloud now--Minnie darning his socks, but never\r\nceasing to listen.\r\n\r\nEach day brought the same sense of grateful amazement that he should be\r\nso wonderfully happy, so extraordinarily peaceful. Everything was as\r\nperfect as it could be. Minnie was looking a different girl. She had\r\nlost her drawn look. She was filling out.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would suspend his reading for a moment, and look across at\r\nher. At first he would see only her soft hair, as she bent over her\r\nsewing. Then, wondering at the silence, she would look up, and he would\r\nmeet her big eyes. And then Henry would gurgle with happiness, and\r\ndemand of himself, silently:\r\n\r\n'Can you beat it!'\r\n\r\nIt was the anniversary of their wedding. They celebrated it in fitting\r\nstyle. They dined at a crowded and exhilarating Italian restaurant on a\r\nstreet off Seventh Avenue, where red wine was included in the bill, and\r\nexcitable people, probably extremely clever, sat round at small tables\r\nand talked all together at the top of their voices. After dinner they\r\nsaw a musical comedy. And then--the great event of the night--they\r\nwent on to supper at a glittering restaurant near Times Square.\r\n\r\nThere was something about supper at an expensive restaurant which had\r\nalways appealed to Henry's imagination. Earnest devourer as he was of\r\nthe solids of literature, he had tasted from time to time its lighter\r\nface--those novels which begin with the hero supping in the midst of\r\nthe glittering throng and having his attention attracted to a\r\ndistinguished-looking elderly man with a grey imperial who is entering\r\nwith a girl so strikingly beautiful that the revellers turn, as she\r\npasses, to look after her. And then, as he sits and smokes, a waiter\r\ncomes up to the hero and, with a soft '_Pardon, m'sieu!_' hands\r\nhim a note.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Geisenheimer's suggested all that sort of thing to\r\nHenry. They had finished supper, and he was smoking a cigar--his second\r\nthat day. He leaned back in his chair and surveyed the scene. He felt\r\nbraced up, adventurous. He had that feeling, which comes to all quiet\r\nmen who like to sit at home and read, that this was the sort of\r\natmosphere in which he really belonged. The brightness of it all--the\r\ndazzling lights, the music, the hubbub, in which the deep-throated\r\ngurgle of the wine-agent surprised while drinking soup blended with the\r\nshriller note of the chorus-girl calling to her mate--these things got\r\nHenry. He was thirty-six next birthday, but he felt a youngish\r\ntwenty-one.\r\n\r\nA voice spoke at his side. Henry looked up, to perceive Sidney Mercer.\r\n\r\nThe passage of a year, which had turned Henry into a married man, had\r\nturned Sidney Mercer into something so magnificent that the spectacle\r\nfor a moment deprived Henry of speech. Faultless evening dress clung\r\nwith loving closeness to Sidney's lissom form. Gleaming shoes of\r\nperfect patent leather covered his feet. His light hair was brushed\r\nback into a smooth sleekness on which the electric lights shone like\r\nstars on some beautiful pool. His practically chinless face beamed\r\namiably over a spotless collar.\r\n\r\nHenry wore blue serge.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing here, Henry, old top?' said the vision. 'I didn't\r\nknow you ever came among the bright lights.'\r\n\r\nHis eyes wandered off to Minnie. There was admiration in them, for\r\nMinnie was looking her prettiest.\r\n\r\n'Wife,' said Henry, recovering speech. And to Minnie: 'Mr Mercer. Old\r\nfriend.'\r\n\r\n'So you're married? Wish you luck. How's the bank?'\r\n\r\nHenry said the bank was doing as well as could be expected.\r\n\r\n'You still on the stage?'\r\n\r\nMr Mercer shook his head importantly.\r\n\r\n'Got better job. Professional dancer at this show. Rolling in money.\r\nWhy aren't you dancing?'\r\n\r\nThe words struck a jarring note. The lights and the music until that\r\nmoment had had a subtle psychological effect on Henry, enabling him to\r\nhypnotize himself into a feeling that it was not inability to dance\r\nthat kept him in his seat, but that he had had so much of that sort of\r\nthing that he really preferred to sit quietly and look on for a change.\r\nSidney's question changed all that. It made him face the truth.\r\n\r\n'I don't dance.'\r\n\r\n'For the love of Mike! I bet Mrs Mills does. Would you care for a turn,\r\nMrs Mills?'\r\n\r\n'No, thank you, really.'\r\n\r\nBut remorse was now at work on Henry. He perceived that he had been\r\nstanding in the way of Minnie's pleasure. Of course she wanted to\r\ndance. All women did. She was only refusing for his sake.\r\n\r\n'Nonsense, Min. Go to it.'\r\n\r\nMinnie looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n'Of course you must dance, Min. I shall be all right. I'll sit here and\r\nsmoke.'\r\n\r\nThe next moment Minnie and Sidney were treading the complicated\r\nmeasure; and simultaneously Henry ceased to be a youngish twenty-one\r\nand was even conscious of a fleeting doubt as to whether he was really\r\nonly thirty-five.\r\n\r\nBoil the whole question of old age down, and what it amounts to is that\r\na man is young as long as he can dance without getting lumbago, and, if\r\nhe cannot dance, he is never young at all. This was the truth that\r\nforced itself upon Henry Wallace Mills, as he sat watching his wife\r\nmoving over the floor in the arms of Sidney Mercer. Even he could see\r\nthat Minnie danced well. He thrilled at the sight of her gracefulness;\r\nand for the first time since his marriage he became introspective. It\r\nhad never struck him before how much younger Minnie was than himself.\r\nWhen she had signed the paper at the City Hall on the occasion of the\r\npurchase of the marriage licence, she had given her age, he remembered\r\nnow, as twenty-six. It had made no impression on him at the time. Now,\r\nhowever, he perceived clearly that between twenty-six and thirty-five\r\nthere was a gap of nine years; and a chill sensation came upon him of\r\nbeing old and stodgy. How dull it must be for poor little Minnie to be\r\ncooped up night after night with such an old fogy? Other men took their\r\nwives out and gave them a good time, dancing half the night with them.\r\nAll he could do was to sit at home and read Minnie dull stuff from the\r\n_Encyclopaedia_. What a life for the poor child! Suddenly, he felt\r\nacutely jealous of the rubber-jointed Sidney Mercer, a man whom\r\nhitherto he had always heartily despised.\r\n\r\nThe music stopped. They came back to the table, Minnie with a pink glow\r\non her face that made her younger than ever; Sidney, the insufferable\r\nass, grinning and smirking and pretending to be eighteen. They looked\r\nlike a couple of children--Henry, catching sight of himself in a\r\nmirror, was surprised to find that his hair was not white.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, in the cab going home, Minnie, half asleep, was\r\naroused by a sudden stiffening of the arm that encircled her waist and\r\na sudden snort close to her ear.\r\n\r\nIt was Henry Wallace Mills resolving that he would learn to dance.\r\n\r\nBeing of a literary turn of mind and also economical, Henry's first\r\nstep towards his new ambition was to buy a fifty-cent book entitled\r\n_The ABC of Modern Dancing_, by 'Tango'. It would, he felt--not\r\nwithout reason--be simpler and less expensive if he should learn the\r\nsteps by the aid of this treatise than by the more customary method of\r\ntaking lessons. But quite early in the proceedings he was faced by\r\ncomplications. In the first place, it was his intention to keep what he\r\nwas doing a secret from Minnie, in order to be able to give her a\r\npleasant surprise on her birthday, which would be coming round in a few\r\nweeks. In the second place, _The ABC of Modern Dancing_ proved on\r\ninvestigation far more complex than its title suggested.\r\n\r\nThese two facts were the ruin of the literary method, for, while it was\r\npossible to study the text and the plates at the bank, the home was the\r\nonly place in which he could attempt to put the instructions into\r\npractice. You cannot move the right foot along dotted line A B and\r\nbring the left foot round curve C D in a paying-cashier's cage in a\r\nbank, nor, if you are at all sensitive to public opinion, on the\r\npavement going home. And while he was trying to do it in the parlour of\r\nthe flat one night when he imagined that Minnie was in the kitchen\r\ncooking supper, she came in unexpectedly to ask how he wanted the steak\r\ncooked. He explained that he had had a sudden touch of cramp, but the\r\nincident shook his nerve.\r\n\r\nAfter this he decided that he must have lessons.\r\n\r\nComplications did not cease with this resolve. Indeed, they became more\r\nacute. It was not that there was any difficulty about finding an\r\ninstructor. The papers were full of their advertisements. He selected a\r\nMme Gavarni because she lived in a convenient spot. Her house was in a\r\nside street, with a station within easy reach. The real problem was\r\nwhen to find time for the lessons. His life was run on such a regular\r\nschedule that he could hardly alter so important a moment in it as the\r\nhour of his arrival home without exciting comment. Only deceit could\r\nprovide a solution.\r\n\r\n'Min, dear,' he said at breakfast.\r\n\r\n'Yes, Henry?'\r\n\r\nHenry turned mauve. He had never lied to her before.\r\n\r\n'I'm not getting enough exercise.'\r\n\r\n'Why you look so well.'\r\n\r\n'I get a kind of heavy feeling sometimes. I think I'll put on another\r\nmile or so to my walk on my way home. So--so I'll be back a little\r\nlater in future.'\r\n\r\n'Very well, dear.'\r\n\r\nIt made him feel like a particularly low type of criminal, but, by\r\nabandoning his walk, he was now in a position to devote an hour a day\r\nto the lessons; and Mme Gavarni had said that that would be ample.\r\n\r\n'Sure, Bill,' she had said. She was a breezy old lady with a military\r\nmoustache and an unconventional manner with her clientele. 'You come to\r\nme an hour a day, and, if you haven't two left feet, we'll make you the\r\npet of society in a month.'\r\n\r\n'Is that so?'\r\n\r\n'It sure is. I never had a failure yet with a pupe, except one. And\r\nthat wasn't my fault.'\r\n\r\n'Had he two left feet?'\r\n\r\n'Hadn't any feet at all. Fell off of a roof after the second lesson,\r\nand had to have 'em cut off him. At that, I could have learned him to\r\ntango with wooden legs, only he got kind of discouraged. Well, see you\r\nMonday, Bill. Be good.'\r\n\r\nAnd the kindly old soul, retrieving her chewing gum from the panel of\r\nthe door where she had placed it to facilitate conversation, dismissed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd now began what, in later years, Henry unhesitatingly considered the\r\nmost miserable period of his existence. There may be times when a man\r\nwho is past his first youth feels more unhappy and ridiculous than when\r\nhe is taking a course of lessons in the modern dance, but it is not\r\neasy to think of them. Physically, his new experience caused Henry\r\nacute pain. Muscles whose existence he had never suspected came into\r\nbeing for--apparently--the sole purpose of aching. Mentally he suffered\r\neven more.\r\n\r\nThis was partly due to the peculiar method of instruction in vogue at\r\nMme Gavarni's, and partly to the fact that, when it came to the actual\r\nlessons, a sudden niece was produced from a back room to give them. She\r\nwas a blonde young lady with laughing blue eyes, and Henry never\r\nclasped her trim waist without feeling a black-hearted traitor to his\r\nabsent Minnie. Conscience racked him. Add to this the sensation of\r\nbeing a strange, jointless creature with abnormally large hands and\r\nfeet, and the fact that it was Mme Gavarni's custom to stand in a\r\ncorner of the room during the hour of tuition, chewing gum and making\r\ncomments, and it is not surprising that Henry became wan and thin.\r\n\r\nMme Gavarni had the trying habit of endeavouring to stimulate Henry by\r\nfrequently comparing his performance and progress with that of a\r\ncripple whom she claimed to have taught at some previous time.\r\n\r\nShe and the niece would have spirited arguments in his presence as to\r\nwhether or not the cripple had one-stepped better after his third\r\nlesson than Henry after his fifth. The niece said no. As well, perhaps,\r\nbut not better. Mme Gavarni said that the niece was forgetting the way\r\nthe cripple had slid his feet. The niece said yes, that was so, maybe\r\nshe was. Henry said nothing. He merely perspired.\r\n\r\nHe made progress slowly. This could not be blamed upon his\r\ninstructress, however. She did all that one woman could to speed him\r\nup. Sometimes she would even pursue him into the street in order to\r\nshow him on the side-walk a means of doing away with some of his\r\nnumerous errors of _technique_, the elimination of which would\r\nhelp to make him definitely the cripple's superior. The misery of\r\nembracing her indoors was as nothing to the misery of embracing her on\r\nthe sidewalk.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, having paid for his course of lessons in advance, and\r\nbeing a determined man, he did make progress. One day, to his surprise,\r\nhe found his feet going through the motions without any definite\r\nexercise of will-power on his part--almost as if they were endowed with\r\nan intelligence of their own. It was the turning-point. It filled him\r\nwith a singular pride such as he had not felt since his first rise of\r\nsalary at the bank.\r\n\r\nMme Gavarni was moved to dignified praise.\r\n\r\n'Some speed, kid!' she observed. 'Some speed!'\r\n\r\nHenry blushed modestly. It was the accolade.\r\n\r\nEvery day, as his skill at the dance became more manifest, Henry found\r\noccasion to bless the moment when he had decided to take lessons. He\r\nshuddered sometimes at the narrowness of his escape from disaster.\r\nEvery day now it became more apparent to him, as he watched Minnie,\r\nthat she was chafing at the monotony of her life. That fatal supper had\r\nwrecked the peace of their little home. Or perhaps it had merely\r\nprecipitated the wreck. Sooner or later, he told himself, she was bound\r\nto have wearied of the dullness of her lot. At any rate, dating from\r\nshortly after that disturbing night, a lack of ease and spontaneity\r\nseemed to creep into their relations. A blight settled on the home.\r\n\r\nLittle by little Minnie and he were growing almost formal towards each\r\nother. She had lost her taste for being read to in the evenings and had\r\ndeveloped a habit of pleading a headache and going early to bed.\r\nSometimes, catching her eye when she was not expecting it, he surprised\r\nan enigmatic look in it. It was a look, however, which he was able to\r\nread. It meant that she was bored.\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected that this state of affairs would have\r\ndistressed Henry. It gave him, on the contrary, a pleasurable thrill.\r\nIt made him feel that it had been worth it, going through the torments\r\nof learning to dance. The more bored she was now the greater her\r\ndelight when he revealed himself dramatically. If she had been\r\ncontented with the life which he could offer her as a non-dancer, what\r\nwas the sense of losing weight and money in order to learn the steps?\r\nHe enjoyed the silent, uneasy evenings which had supplanted those\r\ncheery ones of the first year of their marriage. The more uncomfortable\r\nthey were now, the more they would appreciate their happiness later on.\r\nHenry belonged to the large circle of human beings who consider that\r\nthere is acuter pleasure in being suddenly cured of toothache than in\r\nnever having toothache at all.\r\n\r\nHe merely chuckled inwardly, therefore, when, on the morning of her\r\nbirthday, having presented her with a purse which he knew she had long\r\ncoveted, he found himself thanked in a perfunctory and mechanical way.\r\n\r\n'I'm glad you like it,' he said.\r\n\r\nMinnie looked at the purse without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n'It's just what I wanted,' she said, listlessly.\r\n\r\n'Well, I must be going. I'll get the tickets for the theatre while I'm\r\nin town.'\r\n\r\nMinnie hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n'I don't believe I want to go to the theatre much tonight, Henry.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense. We must have a party on your birthday. We'll go to the\r\ntheatre and then we'll have supper at Geisenheimer's again. I may be\r\nworking after hours at the bank today, so I guess I won't come home.\r\nI'll meet you at that Italian place at six.'\r\n\r\n'Very well. You'll miss your walk, then?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. It doesn't matter for once.'\r\n\r\n'No. You're still going on with your walks, then?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, yes.'\r\n\r\n'Three miles every day?'\r\n\r\n'Never miss it. It keeps me well.'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, darling.'\r\n\r\n'Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nYes, there was a distinct chill in the atmosphere. Thank goodness,\r\nthought Henry, as he walked to the station, it would be different\r\ntomorrow morning. He had rather the feeling of a young knight who has\r\ndone perilous deeds in secret for his lady, and is about at last to\r\nreceive credit for them.\r\n\r\nGeisenheimer's was as brilliant and noisy as it had been before when\r\nHenry reached it that night, escorting a reluctant Minnie. After a\r\nsilent dinner and a theatrical performance during which neither had\r\nexchanged more than a word between the acts, she had wished to abandon\r\nthe idea of supper and go home. But a squad of police could not have\r\nkept Henry from Geisenheimer's. His hour had come. He had thought of\r\nthis moment for weeks, and he visualized every detail of his big scene.\r\nAt first they would sit at their table in silent discomfort. Then\r\nSidney Mercer would come up, as before, to ask Minnie to dance. And\r\nthen--then--Henry would rise and, abandoning all concealment, exclaim\r\ngrandly: 'No! I am going to dance with my wife!' Stunned amazement of\r\nMinnie, followed by wild joy. Utter rout and discomfiture of that\r\npin-head, Mercer. And then, when they returned to their table, he\r\nbreathing easily and regularly as a trained dancer in perfect condition\r\nshould, she tottering a little with the sudden rapture of it all, they\r\nwould sit with their heads close together and start a new life. That\r\nwas the scenario which Henry had drafted.\r\n\r\nIt worked out--up to a certain point--as smoothly as ever it had done\r\nin his dreams. The only hitch which he had feared--to wit, the\r\nnon-appearance of Sidney Mercer, did not occur. It would spoil the\r\nscene a little, he had felt, if Sidney Mercer did not present himself\r\nto play the role of foil; but he need have had no fears on this point.\r\nSidney had the gift, not uncommon in the chinless, smooth-baked type of\r\nman, of being able to see a pretty girl come into the restaurant even\r\nwhen his back was towards the door. They had hardly seated themselves\r\nwhen he was beside their table bleating greetings.\r\n\r\n'Why, Henry! Always here!'\r\n\r\n'Wife's birthday.'\r\n\r\n'Many happy returns of the day, Mrs Mills. We've just time for one turn\r\nbefore the waiter comes with your order. Come along.'\r\n\r\nThe band was staggering into a fresh tune, a tune that Henry knew well.\r\nMany a time had Mme Gavarni hammered it out of an aged and unwilling\r\npiano in order that he might dance with her blue-eyed niece. He rose.\r\n\r\n'No!' he exclaimed grandly. 'I am going to dance with my wife!'\r\n\r\nHe had not under-estimated the sensation which he had looked forward to\r\ncausing. Minnie looked at him with round eyes. Sidney Mercer was\r\nobviously startled.\r\n\r\n'I thought you couldn't dance.'\r\n\r\n'You never can tell,' said Henry, lightly. 'It looks easy enough.\r\nAnyway, I'll try.'\r\n\r\n'Henry!' cried Minnie, as he clasped her.\r\n\r\nHe had supposed that she would say something like that, but hardly in\r\nthat kind of voice. There is a way of saying 'Henry!' which conveys\r\nsurprised admiration and remorseful devotion; but she had not said it\r\nin that way. There had been a note of horror in her voice. Henry's was\r\na simple mind, and the obvious solution, that Minnie thought that he\r\nhad drunk too much red wine at the Italian restaurant, did not occur to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, at the moment too busy to analyse vocal inflections.\r\nThey were on the floor now, and it was beginning to creep upon him like\r\na chill wind that the scenario which he had mapped out was subject to\r\nunforeseen alterations.\r\n\r\nAt first all had been well. They had been almost alone on the floor,\r\nand he had begun moving his feet along dotted line A B with the smooth\r\nvim which had characterized the last few of his course of lessons. And\r\nthen, as if by magic, he was in the midst of a crowd--a mad, jigging\r\ncrowd that seemed to have no sense of direction, no ability whatever to\r\nkeep out of his way. For a moment the tuition of weeks stood by him.\r\nThen, a shock, a stifled cry from Minnie, and the first collision had\r\noccurred. And with that all the knowledge which he had so painfully\r\nacquired passed from Henry's mind, leaving it an agitated blank. This\r\nwas a situation for which his slidings round an empty room had not\r\nprepared him. Stage-fright at its worst came upon him. Somebody charged\r\nhim in the back and asked querulously where he thought he was going. As\r\nhe turned with a half-formed notion of apologizing, somebody else\r\nrammed him from the other side. He had a momentary feeling as if he\r\nwere going down the Niagara Rapids in a barrel, and then he was lying\r\non the floor with Minnie on top of him. Somebody tripped over his head.\r\n\r\nHe sat up. Somebody helped him to his feet. He was aware of Sidney\r\nMercer at his side.\r\n\r\n'Do it again,' said Sidney, all grin and sleek immaculateness. 'It went\r\ndown big, but lots of them didn't see it.'\r\n\r\nThe place was full of demon laughter.\r\n\r\n       *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n'Min!' said Henry.\r\n\r\nThey were in the parlour of their little flat. Her back was towards\r\nhim, and he could not see her face. She did not answer. She preserved\r\nthe silence which she had maintained since they had left the\r\nrestaurant. Not once during the journey home had she spoken.\r\n\r\nThe clock on the mantelpiece ticked on. Outside an Elevated train\r\nrumbled by. Voices came from the street.\r\n\r\n'Min, I'm sorry.'\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n'I thought I could do it. Oh, Lord!' Misery was in every note of\r\nHenry's voice. 'I've been taking lessons every day since that night we\r\nwent to that place first. It's no good--I guess it's like the old woman\r\nsaid. I've got two left feet, and it's no use my ever trying to do it.\r\nI kept it secret from you, what I was doing. I wanted it to be a\r\nwonderful surprise for you on your birthday. I knew how sick and tired\r\nyou were getting of being married to a man who never took you out,\r\nbecause he couldn't dance. I thought it was up to me to learn, and give\r\nyou a good time, like other men's wives. I--'\r\n\r\n'Henry!'\r\n\r\nShe had turned, and with a dull amazement he saw that her whole face\r\nhad altered. Her eyes were shining with a radiant happiness.\r\n\r\n'Henry! Was _that_ why you went to that house--to take dancing\r\nlessons?'\r\n\r\nHe stared at her without speaking. She came to him, laughing.\r\n\r\n'So that was why you pretended you were still doing your walks?'\r\n\r\n'You knew!'\r\n\r\n'I saw you come out of that house. I was just going to the station at\r\nthe end of the street, and I saw you. There was a girl with you, a girl\r\nwith yellow hair. You hugged her!'\r\n\r\nHenry licked his dry lips.\r\n\r\n'Min,' he said huskily. 'You won't believe it, but she was trying to\r\nteach me the Jelly Roll.'\r\n\r\nShe held him by the lapels of his coat.\r\n\r\n'Of course I believe it. I understand it all now. I thought at the time\r\nthat you were just saying good-bye to her! Oh, Henry, why ever didn't\r\nyou tell me what you were doing? Oh, yes, I know you wanted it to be a\r\nsurprise for me on my birthday, but you must have seen there was\r\nsomething wrong. You must have seen that I thought something. Surely\r\nyou noticed how I've been these last weeks?'\r\n\r\n'I thought it was just that you were finding it dull.'\r\n\r\n'Dull! Here, with you!'\r\n\r\n'It was after you danced that night with Sidney Mercer. I thought the\r\nwhole thing out. You're so much younger than I, Min. It didn't seem\r\nright for you to have to spend your life being read to by a fellow like\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'But I loved it!'\r\n\r\n'You had to dance. Every girl has to. Women can't do without it.'\r\n\r\n'This one can. Henry, listen! You remember how ill and worn out I was\r\nwhen you met me first at that farm? Do you know why it was? It was\r\nbecause I had been slaving away for years at one of those places where\r\nyou go in and pay five cents to dance with the lady instructresses. I\r\nwas a lady instructress. Henry! Just think what I went through! Every\r\nday having to drag a million heavy men with large feet round a big\r\nroom. I tell you, you are a professional compared with some of them!\r\nThey trod on my feet and leaned their two hundred pounds on me and\r\nnearly killed me. Now perhaps you can understand why I'm not crazy\r\nabout dancing! Believe me, Henry, the kindest thing you can do to me is\r\nto tell me I must never dance again.'\r\n\r\n'You--you--' he gulped. 'Do you really mean that you can--can stand the\r\nsort of life we're living here? You really don't find it dull?'\r\n\r\n'Dull!'\r\n\r\nShe ran to the bookshelf, and came back with a large volume.\r\n\r\n'Read to me, Henry, dear. Read me something now. It seems ages and ages\r\nsince you used to. Read me something out of the _Encyclopaedia_!'\r\n\r\nHenry was looking at the book in his hand. In the midst of a joy that\r\nalmost overwhelmed him, his orderly mind was conscious of something\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n'But this is the MED-MUM volume, darling.'\r\n\r\n'Is it? Well, that'll be all right. Read me all about \"Mum\".'\r\n\r\n'But we're only in the CAL-CHA--' He wavered. 'Oh, well--I' he went on,\r\nrecklessly. 'I don't care. Do you?'\r\n\r\n'No. Sit down here, dear, and I'll sit on the floor.'\r\n\r\nHenry cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n'\"Milicz, or Militsch (d. 1374), Bohemian divine, was the most\r\ninfluential among those preachers and writers in Moravia and Bohemia\r\nwho, during the fourteenth century, in a certain sense paved the way\r\nfor the reforming activity of Huss.\"'\r\n\r\nHe looked down. Minnie's soft hair was resting against his knee. He put\r\nout a hand and stroked it. She turned and looked up, and he met her big\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n'Can you beat it?' said Henry, silently, to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Man with Two Left Feet, by P.
