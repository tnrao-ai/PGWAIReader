    "SENSATIONAL OCCURRENCE AT A POETRY READING\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nBreakfast was over, and the guests of Blandings had scattered to their\r\nmorning occupations. Some were writing letters, some were in the\r\nbilliard-room: some had gone to the stables, some to the links: Lady\r\nConstance was interviewing the housekeeper, Lord Emsworth harrying\r\nhead-gardener McAllister among the flower-beds: and in the Yew Alley,\r\nthe dappled sunlight falling upon her graceful head, Miss Peavey walked\r\npensively up and down.\r\n\r\nShe was alone. It is a sad but indisputable fact that in this imperfect\r\nworld Genius is too often condemned to walk alone--if the earthier\r\nmembers of the community see it coming and have time to duck. Not one\r\nof the horde of visitors who had arrived overnight for the County Ball\r\nhad shown any disposition whatever to court Miss Peavey’s society.\r\n\r\nOne regrets this. Except for that slight bias towards dishonesty\r\nwhich led her to steal everything she could lay her hands on that was\r\nnot nailed down, Aileen Peavey’s was an admirable character; and,\r\noddly enough, it was the noble side of her nature to which these\r\ncoarse-fibred critics objected. Of Miss Peavey, the purloiner of\r\nother people’s goods, they knew nothing; the woman they were dodging\r\nwas Miss Peavey, the poetess. And it may be mentioned that, however\r\nmuch she might unbend in the presence of a congenial friend like Mr.\r\nEdward Cootes, she was a perfectly genuine poetess. Those six volumes\r\nunder her name in the British Museum catalogue were her own genuine\r\nand unaided work: and, though she had been compelled to pay for the\r\nproduction of the first of the series, the other five had been brought\r\nout at her publisher’s own risk, and had even made a little money.\r\n\r\nMiss Peavey, however, was not sorry to be alone: for she had that on\r\nher mind which called for solitary thinking. The matter engaging her\r\nattention was the problem of what on earth had happened to Mr. Edward\r\nCootes. Two days had passed since he had left her to go and force\r\nPsmith at the pistol’s point to introduce him into the castle: and\r\nsince that moment he had vanished completely. Miss Peavey could not\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\nHis non-appearance was all the more galling in that her superb brain\r\nhad just completed in every detail a scheme for the seizure of Lady\r\nConstance Keeble’s diamond necklace; and to the success of this plot\r\nhis aid was an indispensable adjunct. She was in the position of a\r\ngeneral who comes from his tent with a plan of battle all mapped out,\r\nand finds that his army has strolled off somewhere and left him. Little\r\nwonder that, as she paced the Yew Alley, there was a frown on Miss\r\nPeavey’s fair forehead.\r\n\r\nThe Yew Alley, as Lord Emsworth had indicated in his extremely\r\ninteresting lecture to Mr. Ralston McTodd at the Senior Conservative\r\nClub, contained among other noteworthy features certain yews which rose\r\nin solid blocks with rounded roof and stemless mushroom finials, the\r\nmajority possessing arched recesses, forming arbors. As Miss Peavey was\r\npassing one of these, a voice suddenly addressed her.\r\n\r\n“Hey!”\r\n\r\nMiss Peavey started violently.\r\n\r\n“Anyone about?”\r\n\r\nA damp face with twigs sticking to it was protruding from a near-by\r\nyew. It rolled its eyes in an ineffectual effort to see round the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nMiss Peavey drew nearer, breathing heavily. The question as to the\r\nwhereabouts of her wandering boy was solved; but the abruptness of his\r\nreturn had caused her to bite her tongue; and joy, as she confronted\r\nhim, was blended with other emotions.\r\n\r\n“You dish-faced gazooni!” she exclaimed heatedly, her voice trembling\r\nwith a sense of ill-usage, “where do you get that stuff, hiding in\r\ntrees, and barking a girl’s head off?”\r\n\r\n“Sorry, Liz. I . . .”\r\n\r\n“And where,” proceeded Miss Peavey, ventilating another grievance,\r\n“have you been all this darned time? Gosh-dingit, you leave me a coupla\r\ndays back saying you’re going to stick up this bozo that calls himself\r\nMcTodd with a gat and make him get you into the house, and that’s the\r\nlast I see of you. What’s the big idea?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, Liz. He did get me into the house. I’m his valet.\r\nThat’s why I couldn’t get at you before. The way the help has to keep\r\nitself to itself in this joint, we might as well have been in different\r\ncounties. If I hadn’t happened to see you snooping off by yourself this\r\nmorning . . .”\r\n\r\nMiss Peavey’s keen mind grasped the position of affairs.\r\n\r\n“All right, all right,” she interrupted, ever impatient of long\r\nspeeches from others. “I understand. Well, this is good, Ed. It\r\ncouldn’t have worked out better. I’ve got a scheme all doped out, and\r\nnow you’re here we can get busy.”\r\n\r\n“A scheme?”\r\n\r\n“A pippin,” assented Miss Peavey.\r\n\r\n“It’ll need to be,” said Mr. Cootes, on whom the events of the last few\r\ndays had caused pessimism to set its seal. “I tell you that McTodd gook\r\nis smooth. He somehow,” said Mr. Cootes prudently, for he feared harsh\r\ncriticisms from his lady-love should he reveal the whole truth, “he\r\nsomehow got wise to the notion that, as I was his valet, I could go and\r\nsnoop round in his room, where he’d be wanting to hide the stuff if he\r\never got it, and now he’s gone and got them to let him have a kind of\r\nshack in the woods.”\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said Miss Peavey. “Well,” she resumed after a thoughtful pause,\r\n“I’m not worrying about him. Let him go and roost in the woods all he\r\nwants to. I’ve got a scheme all ready, and it’s gilt-edged. And, unless\r\nyou ball up your end of it, Ed, it can’t fail to drag home the gravy.”\r\n\r\n“Am I in it?”\r\n\r\n“You bet you’re in it. I can’t work it without you. That’s what’s been\r\nmaking me so darned mad when you didn’t show up all this time.”\r\n\r\n“Spill it, Liz,” said Mr. Cootes humbly. As always in the presence of\r\nthis dynamic woman, he was suffering from an inferiority complex. From\r\nthe very start of their combined activities she had been the brains of\r\nthe firm, he merely the instrument to carry into effect the plans she\r\ndictated.\r\n\r\nMiss Peavey glanced swiftly up and down the Yew Alley. It was still the\r\nsame peaceful, lonely spot. She turned to Mr. Cootes again, and spoke\r\nwith brisk decision.\r\n\r\n“Now, listen, Ed, and get this straight, because maybe I shan’t have\r\nanother chance of talking to you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m listening,” said Mr. Cootes obsequiously.\r\n\r\n“Well, to begin with, now that the house is full, Her Nibs is wearing\r\nthat necklace every night. And you can take it from me, Ed, that you\r\nwant to put on your smoked glasses before you look at it. It’s a\r\nlalapaloosa.”\r\n\r\n“As good as that?”\r\n\r\n“Ask me! You don’t know the half of it.”\r\n\r\n“Where does she keep it, Liz? Have you found that out?” asked Mr.\r\nCootes, a gleam of optimism playing across his sad face for an instant.\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t. And I don’t want to. I’ve not got time to waste\r\nmonkeying about with safes and maybe having the whole bunch pile on the\r\nback of my neck. I believe in getting things easy. Well, to-night this\r\nbimbo that calls himself McTodd is going to give a reading of his poems\r\nin the big drawing-room. You know where that is?”\r\n\r\n“I can find out.”\r\n\r\n“And you better had find out,” said Miss Peavey vehemently. “And before\r\nto-night at that. Well, there you are. Do you begin to get wise?”\r\n\r\nMr. Cootes, his head protruding unhappily from the yew tree, would have\r\ngiven much to have been able to make the demanded claim to wisdom,\r\nfor he knew of old the store his alert partner set upon quickness\r\nof intellect. He was compelled, however, to disturb the branches by\r\nshaking his head.\r\n\r\n“You always were pretty dumb,” said Miss Peavey with scorn. “I’ll say\r\nthat you’ve got good solid qualities, Ed--from the neck up. Why, I’m\r\ngoing to sit behind Lady Constance while that goof is shooting his fool\r\nhead off, and I’m going to reach out and grab that necklace off of her.\r\nSee?”\r\n\r\n“But, Liz”--Mr. Cootes diffidently summoned up courage to point out\r\nwhat appeared to him to be a flaw in the scheme--“if you start any\r\nstrong-arm work in front of everybody like the way you say, won’t\r\nthey . . . ?”\r\n\r\n“No, they won’t. And I’ll tell you why they won’t. They aren’t going to\r\nsee me do it, because when I do it it’s going to be good and dark in\r\nthat room. And it’s going to be dark because you’ll be somewheres out\r\nat the back of the house, wherever they keep the main electric-light\r\nworks, turning the switch as hard as you can go. See? That’s your end\r\nof it, and pretty soft for you at that. All you have to do is to find\r\nout where the thing is and what you have to do to it to put out all the\r\nlights in the joint. I guess I can trust you not to bungle that?”\r\n\r\n“Liz,” said Mr. Cootes, and there was reverence in his voice, “you can\r\ndo just that little thing. But what . . . ?”\r\n\r\n“All right, I know what you’re going to say. What happens after that,\r\nand how do I get away with the stuff? Well, the window’ll be open, and\r\nI’ll just get to it and fling the necklace out. See? There’ll be a big\r\nfuss going on in the room on account of the darkness and all that, and\r\nwhile everybody’s cutting up and what-the-helling, you’ll pick up your\r\ndogs and run round as quick as you can make it and pouch the thing. I\r\nguess it won’t be hard for you to locate it. The window’s just over the\r\nterrace, all smooth turf, and it isn’t real dark nights now, and you\r\nought to have plenty of time to hunt around before they can get the\r\nlights going again. . . . Well, what do you think of it?” There was a\r\nbrief silence.\r\n\r\n“Liz,” said Mr. Cootes at length.\r\n\r\n“Is it or is it not,” demanded Miss Peavey, “a ball of fire?”\r\n\r\n“Liz,” said Mr. Cootes, and his voice was husky with such awe as some\r\nyoung officer of Napoleon’s staff might have felt on hearing the\r\ndetails of the latest plan of campaign, “Liz, I’ve said it before, and\r\nI’ll say it again. When it comes to the smooth stuff, old girl, you’re\r\nthe oyster’s eye-tooth!”\r\n\r\nAnd, reaching out an arm from the recesses of the yew, he took Miss\r\nPeavey’s hand in his and gave it a tender squeeze. A dreamy look came\r\ninto the poetess’s fine eyes, and she giggled a little. Dumb-bell\r\nthough he was, she loved this man.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\n“Mr. Baxter!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Miss Halliday?”\r\n\r\nThe Brains of Blandings looked abstractedly up from his desk. It was\r\nonly some half-hour since luncheon had finished, but already he was in\r\nthe library surrounded by large books like a sea-beast among rocks.\r\nMost of his time was spent in the library when the castle was full of\r\nguests, for his lofty mind was ill-attuned to the frivolous babblings\r\nof Society butterflies.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you could spare me this afternoon?” said Eve.\r\n\r\nBaxter directed the glare of his spectacles upon her inquisitorially.\r\n\r\n“The whole afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind. You see, I had a letter by the second post from a\r\ngreat friend of mine, saying that she will be in Market Blandings this\r\nafternoon and asking me to meet her there. I must see her, Mr. Baxter,\r\n_please_. You’ve no notion how important it is.”\r\n\r\nEve’s manner was excited, and her eyes as they met Baxter’s sparkled in\r\na fashion that might have disturbed a man made of less stern stuff. If\r\nit had been the Hon. Freddie Threepwood, for instance, who had been\r\ngazing into their blue depths, that impulsive youth would have tied\r\nhimself into knots and yapped like a dog. Baxter, the superman, felt\r\nno urge towards any such display. He reviewed her request calmly and\r\njudicially, and decided that it was a reasonable one.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Miss Halliday.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you ever so much. I’ll make up for it by working twice as hard\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nEve flitted to the door, pausing there to bestow a grateful smile upon\r\nhim before going out; and Baxter returned to his reading. For a moment\r\nhe was conscious of a feeling of regret that this quite attractive and\r\nuniformly respectful girl should be the partner in crime of a man of\r\nwhom he disapproved even more than he disapproved of most malefactors.\r\nThen he crushed down the weak emotion and was himself again.\r\n\r\nEve trotted downstairs, humming happily to herself. She had expected\r\na longer and more strenuous struggle before she obtained her order of\r\nrelease, and told herself that, despite a manner which seldom deviated\r\nfrom the forbidding, Baxter was really quite nice. In short, it seemed\r\nto her that nothing could possibly occur to mar the joyfulness of this\r\nadmirable afternoon; and it was only when a voice hailed her as she was\r\ngoing through the hall a few minutes later that she realised that she\r\nwas mistaken. The voice, which trembled throatily, was that of the Hon.\r\nFreddie; and her first look at him told Eve, an expert diagnostician,\r\nthat he was going to propose to her again.\r\n\r\n“Well, Freddie?” said Eve resignedly.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Frederick Threepwood was a young man who was used to hearing\r\npeople say “Well, Freddie?” resignedly when he appeared. His father\r\nsaid it; his Aunt Constance said it; all his other aunts and uncles\r\nsaid it. Widely differing personalities in every other respect, they\r\nall said “Well, Freddie?” resignedly directly they caught sight of him.\r\nEve’s words, therefore, and the tone in which they were spoken, did not\r\ndamp him as they might have damped another. His only feeling was one of\r\nsolemn gladness at the thought that at last he had managed to get her\r\nalone for half a minute.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this was the first time he had been able to get her\r\nalone since her arrival at the castle had caused Freddie a good deal\r\nof sorrow. Bad luck was what he attributed it to, thereby giving the\r\nobject of his affections less credit than was her due for a masterly\r\npolicy of evasion. He sidled up, looking like a well-dressed sheep.\r\n\r\n“Going anywhere?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’m going to Market Blandings. Isn’t it a lovely afternoon?\r\nI suppose you are busy all the time now that the house is full?\r\nGood-bye,” said Eve.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said Freddie, blinking.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye. I must be hurrying.”\r\n\r\n“Where did you say you were going?”\r\n\r\n“Market Blandings.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll come with you.”\r\n\r\n“No, I want to be alone. I’ve got to meet someone there.”\r\n\r\n“Come with you as far as the gates,” said Freddie, the human limpet.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sun seemed to Eve to be shining a little less brightly as\r\nthey started down the drive. She was a kind-hearted girl, and it irked\r\nher to have to be continually acting as a black frost in Freddie’s\r\ngarden of dreams. There appeared, however, to be but two ways out of\r\nthe thing: either she must accept him or he must stop proposing. The\r\nfirst of these alternatives she resolutely declined to consider, and,\r\nas far as was ascertainable from his actions, Freddie declined just\r\nas resolutely to consider the second. The result was that solitary\r\ninterviews between them were seldom wholly free from embarrassing\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nThey walked for a while in silence. Then:\r\n\r\n“You’re dashed hard on a fellow,” said Freddie.\r\n\r\n“How’s your putting coming on?” asked Eve.\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“Your putting. You told me you had so much trouble with it.”\r\n\r\nShe was not looking at him, for she had developed a habit of not\r\nlooking at him on these occasions; but she assumed that the odd sound\r\nwhich greeted her remark was a hollow, mirthless laugh.\r\n\r\n“My putting!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you told me yourself it’s the most important part of golf.”\r\n\r\n“Golf! Do you think I have time to worry about golf these days?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how splendid, Freddie! Are you really doing some work of some\r\nkind? It’s quite time, you know. Think how pleased your father will be.”\r\n\r\n“I say,” said Freddie, “I do think you might marry a chap.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I shall some day,” said Eve, “if I meet the right one.”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” said Freddie despairingly. She was not usually so dense as\r\nthis. He had always looked on her as a dashed clever girl. “I mean\r\n_me_.”\r\n\r\nEve sighed. She had hoped to avert the inevitable.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Freddie!” she exclaimed, exasperated. She was still sorry for\r\nhim, but she could not help being irritated. It was such a splendid\r\nafternoon and she had been feeling so happy. And now he had spoiled\r\neverything. It always took her at least half an hour to get over the\r\nnervous strain of refusing his proposals.\r\n\r\n“I love you, dash it!” said Freddie.\r\n\r\n“Well, do stop loving me,” said Eve. “I’m an awful girl, really. I’d\r\nmake you miserable.”\r\n\r\n“Happiest man in the world,” corrected Freddie devoutly.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a frightful temper.”\r\n\r\n“You’re an angel.”\r\n\r\nEve’s exasperation increased. She always had a curious fear that one of\r\nthese days, if he went on proposing, she might say “Yes” by mistake.\r\nShe wished that there was some way known to science of stopping him\r\nonce and for all. And in her desperation she thought of a line of\r\nargument which she had not yet employed.\r\n\r\n“It’s so absurd, Freddie,” she said. “Really, it is. Apart from the\r\nfact that I don’t want to marry you, how can you marry anyone--anyone,\r\nI mean, who hasn’t plenty of money?”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t dream of marrying for money.”\r\n\r\n“No, of course not, but . . .”\r\n\r\n“Cupid,” said Freddie woodenly, “pines and sickens in a gilded cage.”\r\n\r\nEve had not expected to be surprised by anything her companion might\r\nsay, it being her experience that he possessed a vocabulary of about\r\nforty-three words and a sum-total of ideas that hardly ran into two\r\nfigures; but this poetic remark took her back.\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\nFreddie repeated the observation. When it had been flashed on the\r\nscreen as a spoken sub-title in the six-reel wonder film, “Love or\r\nMammon” (Beatrice Comely and Brian Fraser), he had approved and made a\r\nnote of it.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Eve, and was silent. As Miss Peavey would have put it, it\r\nheld her for a while. “What I meant,” she went on after a moment, “was\r\nthat you can’t possibly marry a girl without money unless you’ve some\r\nmoney of your own.”\r\n\r\n“I say, dash it!” A strange note of jubilation had come into the\r\nwooer’s voice. “I say, is that really all that stands between us?\r\nBecause . . .”\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t!”\r\n\r\n“Because, look here, I’m going to have quite a good deal of money at\r\nany moment. It’s more or less of a secret, you know--in fact a pretty\r\ndeadish secret--so keep it dark, but Uncle Joe is going to give me a\r\ncouple of thousand quid. He promised me. Two thousand of the crispest.\r\nAbsolutely!”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Joe?”\r\n\r\n“_You_ know. Old Keeble. He’s going to give me a couple of thousand\r\nquid, and then I’m going to buy a partnership in a bookie’s business\r\nand simply coin money. Stands to reason, I mean. You can’t help making\r\nyour bally fortune. Look at all the mugs who are losing money all the\r\ntime at the races. It’s the bookies that get the stuff. A pal of mine\r\nwho was up at Oxford with me is in a bookie’s office, and they’re going\r\nto let me in if I . . .”\r\n\r\nThe momentous nature of his information had caused Eve to deviate now\r\nfrom her policy of keeping her eyes off Freddie when in emotional vein.\r\nAnd, if she had desired to check his lecture on finance, she could\r\nhave chosen no better method than to look at him; for, meeting her\r\ngaze, Freddie immediately lost the thread of his discourse and stood\r\nyammering. A direct hit from Eve’s eyes always affected him in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Keeble is going to give you two thousand pounds!”\r\n\r\nA wave of mortification swept over Eve. If there was one thing on which\r\nshe prided herself, it was the belief that she was a loyal friend,\r\na staunch pal; and now for the first time she found herself facing\r\nthe unpleasant truth that she had been neglecting Phyllis Jackson’s\r\ninterests in the most abominable way ever since she had come to\r\nBlandings. She had definitely promised Phyllis that she would tackle\r\nthis stepfather of hers and shame him with burning words into yielding\r\nup the three thousand pounds which Phyllis needed so desperately for\r\nher Lincolnshire farm. And what had she done? Nothing.\r\n\r\nEve was honest to the core, even in her dealings with herself. A less\r\nconscientious girl might have argued that she had had no opportunity\r\nof a private interview with Mr. Keeble. She scorned to soothe herself\r\nwith this specious plea. If she had given her mind to it she could have\r\nbrought about a dozen private interviews, and she knew it. No. She\r\nhad allowed the pleasant persistence of Psmith to take up her time,\r\nand Phyllis and her troubles had been thrust into the background. She\r\nconfessed, despising herself, that she had hardly given Phyllis a\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while this Mr. Keeble had been in a position to scatter\r\nlargess, thousands of pounds of it, to undeserving people like Freddie.\r\nWhy, a word from her about Phyllis would have . . .\r\n\r\n“Two thousand pounds?” she repeated dizzily. “Mr. Keeble!”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely!” cried Freddie radiantly. The first shock of looking into\r\nher eyes had passed, and he was now revelling in that occupation.\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\nFreddie’s rapt gaze flickered. Love, he perceived, had nearly caused\r\nhim to be indiscreet.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know,” he mumbled. “He’s just giving it me, you know,\r\ndon’t you know.”\r\n\r\n“Did you simply go to him and ask him for it?”\r\n\r\n“Well--er--well, yes. That was about the strength of it.”\r\n\r\n“And he didn’t object?”\r\n\r\n“No. He seemed rather pleased.”\r\n\r\n“Pleased!” Eve found breathing difficult. She was feeling rather like a\r\nman who suddenly discovers that the hole in his back yard which he has\r\nbeen passing nonchalantly for months is a goldmine. If the operation of\r\nextracting money from Mr. Keeble was not only easy but also agreeable\r\nto the victim . . . She became aware of a sudden imperative need for\r\nFreddie’s absence. She wanted to think this thing over.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Freddie, “coming back to it, will you?”\r\n\r\n“What?” said Eve, distrait.\r\n\r\n“Marry me, you know. What I mean to say is, I worship the very\r\nground you walk on, and all that sort of rot . . . I mean, and all\r\nthat. And now that you realise that I’m going to get this couple of\r\nthousand . . . and the bookie’s business . . . and what not, I mean to\r\nsay . . .”\r\n\r\n“Freddie,” said Eve tensely, expressing her harassed nerves in a voice\r\nthat came hotly through clenched teeth, “go away!”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to marry you, and I’m sick of having to keep on telling\r\nyou so. Will you please go away and leave me alone?” She stopped. Her\r\nsense of fairness told her that she was working off on her hapless\r\nsuitor venom which should have been expended on herself. “I’m sorry,\r\nFreddie,” she said, softening; “I didn’t mean to be such a beast as\r\nthat. I know you’re awfully fond of me, but really, really I can’t\r\nmarry you. You don’t want to marry a girl who doesn’t love you, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” said Freddie stoutly. “If it’s you, I mean. Love is a\r\ntiny seed that coldness can wither, but if tended and nurtured in the\r\nfostering warmth of an honest heart . . .”\r\n\r\n“But, Freddie.”\r\n\r\n“Blossoms into a flower,” concluded Freddie rapidly. “What I mean to\r\nsay is, love would come after marriage.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s the way it happened in ‘A Society Mating.’”\r\n\r\n“Freddie,” said Eve, “I really don’t want to talk any more. Will you be\r\na dear and just go away? I’ve got a lot of thinking to do.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thinking?” said Freddie, impressed. “Right ho!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you so much.”\r\n\r\n“Oh--er--not at all. Well, pip-pip.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“See you later, what?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Fine! Well, toodle-oo!”\r\n\r\nAnd the Hon. Freddie, not ill-pleased--for it seemed to him that at\r\nlong last he detected signs of melting in the party of the second\r\npart--swivelled round on his long legs and started for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThe little town of Market Blandings was a peaceful sight as it slept\r\nin the sun. For the first time since Freddie had left her, Eve became\r\nconscious of a certain tranquillity as she entered the old grey High\r\nStreet, which was the centre of the place’s life and thought. Market\r\nBlandings had a comforting air of having been exactly the same for\r\ncenturies. Troubles might vex the generations it housed, but they did\r\nnot worry that lichened church with its sturdy four-square tower, nor\r\nthose red-roofed shops, nor the age-old inns whose second stories\r\nbulged so comfortably out over the pavements. As Eve walked in slow\r\nmeditation towards the “Emsworth Arms,” the intensely respectable\r\nhostelry which was her objective, archways met her gaze, opening with a\r\npicturesque unexpectedness to show heartening glimpses of ancient nooks\r\nall cool and green. There was about the High Street of Market Blandings\r\na suggestion of a slumbering cathedral close. Nothing was modern in\r\nit except the moving-picture house--and even that called itself an\r\nElectric Theatre, and was ivy-covered and surmounted by stone gables.\r\n\r\nOn second thoughts, that statement is too sweeping. There was one other\r\nmodern building in the High Street--Jno. Banks, Hairdresser, to wit,\r\nand Eve was just coming abreast of Mr. Banks’s emporium now.\r\n\r\nIn any ordinary surroundings these premises would have been a tolerably\r\nattractive sight, but in Market Blandings they were almost an eyesore;\r\nand Eve, finding herself at the door, was jarred out of her reverie as\r\nif she had heard a false note in a solemn anthem. She was on the point\r\nof hurrying past, when the door opened and a short, solid figure came\r\nout. And at the sight of this short, solid figure Eve stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\nIt was with the object of getting his grizzled locks clipped in\r\npreparation for the County Ball that Joseph Keeble had come to Mr.\r\nBanks’s shop as soon as he had finished lunch. As he emerged now into\r\nthe High Street he was wondering why he had permitted Mr. Banks to\r\nfinish off the job with a heliotrope-scented hair-wash. It seemed to\r\nMr. Keeble that the air was heavy with heliotrope, and it came to him\r\nsuddenly that heliotrope was a scent which he always found particularly\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily Joseph Keeble was accustomed to show an iron front to\r\nhairdressers who tried to inflict lotions upon him; and the reason his\r\nvigilance had relaxed under the ministrations of Jno. Banks was that\r\nthe second post, which arrived at the castle at the luncheon hour,\r\nhad brought him a plaintive letter from his stepdaughter Phyllis--the\r\nsecond he had had from her since the one which had caused him to\r\ntackle his masterful wife in the smoking-room. Immediately after\r\nthe conclusion of his business deal with the Hon. Freddie, he had\r\nwritten to Phyllis in a vein of optimism rendered glowing by Freddie’s\r\npromises, assuring her that at any moment he would be in a position to\r\nsend her the three thousand pounds which she required to clinch the\r\npurchase of that dream-farm in Lincolnshire. To this she had replied\r\nwith thanks. And after that there had been a lapse of days and still\r\nhe had not made good. Phyllis was becoming worried, and said so in six\r\nclosely-written pages.\r\n\r\nMr. Keeble, as he sat in the barber’s chair going over this letter in\r\nhis mind, had groaned in spirit, while Jno. Banks with gleaming eyes\r\ndid practically what he liked with the heliotrope bottle. Not for the\r\nfirst time since the formation of their partnership, Joseph Keeble was\r\ntormented with doubts as to his wisdom in entrusting a commission so\r\ndelicate as the purloining of his wife’s diamond necklace to one of his\r\nnephew Freddie’s known feebleness of intellect. Here, he told himself\r\nunhappily, was a job of work which would have tested the combined\r\nabilities of a syndicate consisting of Charles Peace and the James\r\nBrothers, and he had put it in the hands of a young man who in all\r\nhis life had only once shown genuine inspiration and initiative--on\r\nthe occasion when he had parted his hair in the middle at a time when\r\nall the other members of the Bachelors’ Club were brushing it straight\r\nback. The more Mr. Keeble thought of Freddie’s chances, the slimmer\r\nthey appeared. By the time Jno. Banks had released him from the spotted\r\napron he was thoroughly pessimistic, and as he passed out of the door,\r\n“so perfumed that the winds were love-sick with him,” his estimate of\r\nhis colleague’s abilities was reduced to a point where he began to\r\ndoubt whether the stealing of a mere milk-can was not beyond his scope.\r\nSo deeply immersed was he in these gloomy thoughts that Eve had to call\r\nhis name twice before he came out of them.\r\n\r\n“Miss Halliday?” he said apologetically. “I beg your pardon. I was\r\nthinking.”\r\n\r\nEve, though they had hardly exchanged a word since her arrival at the\r\ncastle, had taken a liking to Mr. Keeble; and she felt in consequence\r\nnone of the embarrassment which might have handicapped her in the\r\ndiscussion of an extremely delicate matter with another man. By nature\r\ndirect and straightforward, she came to the point at once.\r\n\r\n“Can you spare me a moment or two, Mr. Keeble?” she said. She glanced\r\nat the clock on the church tower and saw that she had ample time before\r\nher own appointment. “I want to talk to you about Phyllis.” Mr. Keeble\r\njerked his head back in astonishment, and the world became noisome with\r\nheliotrope. It was as if the Voice of Conscience had suddenly addressed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Phyllis!” he gasped, and the letter crackled in his breast-pocket.\r\n\r\n“Your stepdaughter Phyllis.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know her?”\r\n\r\n“She was my best friend at school. I had tea with her just before I\r\ncame to the castle.”\r\n\r\n“Extraordinary!” said Mr. Keeble.\r\n\r\nA customer in quest of a shave thrust himself between them and went\r\ninto the shop. They moved away a few paces.\r\n\r\n“Of course if you say it is none of my business . . .”\r\n\r\n“My dear young lady . . .”\r\n\r\n“Well, it _is_ my business, because she’s my friend,” said Eve firmly.\r\n“Mr. Keeble, Phyllis told me she had written to you about buying that\r\nfarm. Why don’t you help her?”\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was warm, but not warm enough to account for the\r\nmoistness of Mr. Keeble’s brow. He drew out a large handkerchief and\r\nmopped his forehead. A hunted look was in his eyes. The hand which was\r\nnot occupied with the handkerchief had sought his pocket and was busy\r\nrattling keys.\r\n\r\n“I want to help her. I would do anything in the world to help her.”\r\n\r\n“Then why don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I--I am curiously situated.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Phyllis told me something about that. I can see that it is a\r\ndifficult position for you. But, Mr. Keeble, surely, surely if you\r\ncan manage to give Freddie Threepwood two thousand pounds to start a\r\nbookmaker’s business . . .”\r\n\r\nHer words were cut short by a strangled cry from her companion. Sheer\r\npanic was in his eyes now, and in his heart an overwhelming regret that\r\nhe had ever been fool enough to dabble in crime in the company of a\r\nmere animated talking-machine like his nephew Freddie. This girl knew!\r\nAnd if she knew, how many others knew? The young imbecile had probably\r\nbabbled his hideous secret into the ears of every human being in the\r\nplace who would listen to him.\r\n\r\n“He told you!” he stammered. “He t-told you!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Just now.”\r\n\r\n“Goosh!” muttered Mr. Keeble brokenly.\r\n\r\nEve stared at him in surprise. She could not understand this emotion.\r\nThe handkerchief, after a busy session, was lowered now, and he was\r\nlooking at her imploringly.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t told anyone?” he croaked hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Of course not. I said I had only heard of it just now.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t tell anyone?”\r\n\r\n“Why should I?”\r\n\r\nMr. Keeble’s breath, which had seemed to him for a moment gone for\r\never, began to return timidly. Relief for a space held him dumb. What\r\nnonsense, he reflected, these newspapers and people talked about the\r\nmodern girl. It was this very broad-mindedness of hers, to which they\r\nobjected so absurdly, that made her a creature of such charm. She\r\nmight behave in certain ways in a fashion that would have shocked her\r\ngrandmother, but how comforting it was to find her calm and unmoved in\r\nthe contemplation of another’s crime. His heart warmed to Eve.\r\n\r\n“You’re wonderful!” he said.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” argued Mr. Keeble, “it isn’t really stealing.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“I shall buy my wife another necklace.”\r\n\r\n“You will--what?”\r\n\r\n“So everything will be all right. Constance will be perfectly happy,\r\nand Phyllis will have her money, and . . .”\r\n\r\nSomething in Eve’s astonished gaze seemed to smite Mr. Keeble.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you _know_?” he broke off.\r\n\r\n“Know? Know what?”\r\n\r\nMr. Keeble perceived that he had wronged Freddie. The young ass had\r\nbeen a fool even to mention the money to this girl, but he had at\r\nleast, it seemed, stopped short of disclosing the entire plot. An\r\noyster-like reserve came upon him.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing,” he said hastily. “Forget what I was going to say.\r\nWell, I must be going, I must be going.”\r\n\r\nEve clutched wildly at his retreating sleeve. Unintelligible though\r\nhis words had been, one sentence had come home to her, the one about\r\nPhyllis having her money. It was no time for half-measures. She grabbed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Keeble,” she cried urgently. “I don’t know what you mean, but you\r\nwere just going to say something which sounded . . . Mr. Keeble, do\r\ntrust me. I’m Phyllis’s best friend, and if you’ve thought out any way\r\nof helping her I wish you would tell me . . . You must tell me. I might\r\nbe able to help . . .”\r\n\r\nMr. Keeble, as she began her broken speech, had been endeavouring with\r\ndeprecatory tugs to disengage his coat from her grasp. But now he\r\nceased to struggle. Those doubts of Freddie’s efficiency, which had\r\ntroubled him in Jno. Banks’s chair, still lingered. His opinion that\r\nFreddie was but a broken reed had not changed. Indeed, it had grown.\r\nHe looked at Eve. He looked at her searchingly. Into her pleading\r\neyes he directed a stare that sought to probe her soul, and saw there\r\nhonesty, sympathy, and--better still--intelligence. He might have stood\r\nand gazed into Freddie’s fishy eyes for weeks without discovering a\r\ntithe of such intelligence. His mind was made up. This girl was an\r\nally. A girl of dash and vigour. A girl worth a thousand Freddies--not,\r\nhowever, reflected Mr. Keeble, that that was saying much. He hesitated\r\nno longer.\r\n\r\n“It’s like this,” said Mr. Keeble.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nThe information, authoritatively conveyed to him during breakfast\r\nby Lady Constance, that he was scheduled that night to read select\r\npassages from Ralston McTodd’s _Songs of Squalor_ to the entire\r\nhouse-party assembled in the big drawing-room, had come as a complete\r\nsurprise to Psmith, and to his fellow-guests--such of them as were\r\nyoung and of the soulless sex--as a shock from which they found it\r\nhard to rally. True, they had before now gathered in a vague sort\r\nof way that he was one of those literary fellows, but so normal and\r\nengaging had they found his whole manner and appearance that it had\r\nnever occurred to them that he concealed anything up his sleeve as\r\nlethal as _Songs of Squalor_. Among these members of the younger set\r\nthe consensus of opinion was that it was a bit thick, and that at such\r\na price even the lavish hospitality of Blandings was scarcely worth\r\nhaving. Only those who had visited the castle before during the era\r\nof her ladyship’s flirtation with Art could have been described as\r\nresigned. These stout hearts argued that while this latest blister was\r\nprobably going to be pretty bad, he could hardly be worse than the\r\nchappie who had lectured on Theosophy last November, and must almost of\r\nnecessity be better than the bird who during the Shifley race-week had\r\nattempted in a two-hour discourse to convert them to vegetarianism.\r\n\r\nPsmith himself regarded the coming ordeal with equanimity. He was not\r\none of those whom the prospect of speaking in public afflicts with\r\nnervous horror. He liked the sound of his own voice, and night, when it\r\ncame, found him calmly cheerful. He listened contentedly to the murmur\r\nof the drawing-room filling up as he strolled on the star-lit terrace,\r\nsmoking a last cigarette before duty called him elsewhere. And when,\r\nsome few yards away, seated on the terrace wall gazing out into the\r\nvelvet darkness, he perceived Eve Halliday, his sense of well-being\r\nbecame acute.\r\n\r\nAll day he had been conscious of a growing desire for another of those\r\ncosy chats with Eve which had done so much to make life agreeable for\r\nhim during his stay at Blandings. Her prejudice--which he deplored--in\r\nfavour of doing a certain amount of work to justify her salary, had\r\nkept him during the morning away from the little room off the library\r\nwhere she was wont to sit cataloguing books; and when he had gone there\r\nafter lunch he had found it empty. As he approached her now, he was\r\nthinking pleasantly of all those delightful walks, those excellent\r\ndriftings on the lake, and those cheery conversations which had gone\r\nto cement his conviction that of all possible girls she was the only\r\npossible one. It seemed to him that in addition to being beautiful she\r\nbrought out all that was best in him of intellect and soul. That is\r\nto say, she let him talk oftener and longer than any girl he had ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nIt struck him as a little curious that she made no move to greet him.\r\nShe remained apparently unaware of his approach. And yet the summer\r\nnight was not of such density as to hide him from view--and, even\r\nif she could not see him, she must undoubtedly have heard him; for\r\nonly a moment before he had tripped with some violence over a large\r\nflower-pot, one of a row of sixteen which Angus McAllister, doubtless\r\nfor some good purpose, had placed in the fairway that afternoon.\r\n\r\n“A pleasant night,” he said, seating himself gracefully beside her on\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head for a brief instant, and, having turned it, looked\r\naway again.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said.\r\n\r\nHer manner was not effusive, but Psmith persevered.\r\n\r\n“The stars,” he proceeded, indicating them with a kindly yet not\r\npatronising wave of the hand. “Bright, twinkling, and--if I may say\r\nso--rather neatly arranged. When I was a mere lad, someone whose name\r\nI cannot recollect taught me which was Orion. Also Mars, Venus, and\r\nJupiter. This thoroughly useless chunk of knowledge has, I am happy to\r\nsay, long since passed from my mind. However, I am in a position to\r\nstate that that wiggly thing up there a little to the right is King\r\nCharles’s Wain.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, I assure you.” It struck Psmith that Astronomy was not\r\ngripping his audience, so he tried Travel. “I hear,” he said, “you went\r\nto Market Blandings this afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“An attractive settlement.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Psmith removed his monocle and polished it\r\nthoughtfully. The summer night seemed to him to have taken on a touch\r\nof chill.\r\n\r\n“What I like about the English rural districts,” he went on, “is\r\nthat when the authorities have finished building a place they stop.\r\nSomewhere about the reign of Henry the Eighth, I imagine that the\r\nmaster-mason gave the final house a pat with his trowel and said,\r\n‘Well, boys, that’s Market Blandings.’ To which his assistants no doubt\r\nassented with many a hearty ‘Grammercy!’ and ‘I’fackins!’ these being\r\nexpletives to which they were much addicted. And they went away and\r\nleft it, and nobody has touched it since. And I, for one, thoroughly\r\napprove. I think it makes the place soothing. Don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nAs far as the darkness would permit, Psmith subjected Eve to an\r\ninquiring glance through his monocle. This was a strange new\r\nmood in which he had found her. Hitherto, though she had always\r\nendeared herself to him by permitting him the major portion of\r\nthe dialogue, they had usually split conversations on at least a\r\nseventy-five--twenty-five basis. And though it gratified Psmith to be\r\nallowed to deliver a monologue when talking with most people, he found\r\nEve more companionable when in a slightly chattier vein.\r\n\r\n“Are you coming in to hear me read?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nIt was a change from “Yes,” but that was the best that could be said of\r\nit. A good deal of discouragement was always required to damp Psmith,\r\nbut he could not help feeling a slight diminution of buoyancy. However,\r\nhe kept on trying.\r\n\r\n“You show your usual sterling good sense,” he said approvingly. “A\r\nscalier method of passing the scented summer night could hardly be\r\nhit upon.” He abandoned the topic of the reading. It did not grip.\r\nThat was manifest. It lacked appeal. “I went to Market Blandings this\r\nafternoon, too,” he said. “Comrade Baxter informed me that you had gone\r\nthither, so I went after you. Not being able to find you, I turned in\r\nfor half an hour at the local moving-picture palace. They were showing\r\nEpisode Eleven of a serial. It concluded with the heroine, kidnapped by\r\nIndians, stretched on the sacrificial altar with the high-priest making\r\npasses at her with a knife. The hero meanwhile had started to climb a\r\nrather nasty precipice on his way to the rescue. The final picture was\r\na close-up of his fingers slipping slowly off a rock. Episode Twelve\r\nnext week.”\r\n\r\nEve looked out into the night without speaking.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid it won’t end happily,” said Psmith with a sigh. “I think\r\nhe’ll save her.”\r\n\r\nEve turned on him with a menacing abruptness.\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell you why I went to Market Blandings this afternoon?” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Do,” said Psmith cordially. “It is not for me to criticise, but as\r\na matter of fact I was rather wondering when you were going to begin\r\ntelling me all about your adventures. I have been monopolising the\r\nconversation.”\r\n\r\n“I went to meet Cynthia.”\r\n\r\nPsmith’s monocle fell out of his eye and swung jerkily on its cord. He\r\nwas not easily disconcerted, but this unexpected piece of information,\r\ncoming on top of her peculiar manner, undoubtedly jarred him. He\r\nforesaw difficulties, and once again found himself thinking hard\r\nthoughts of this confounded female who kept bobbing up when least\r\nexpected. How simple life would have been, he mused wistfully, had\r\nRalston McTodd only had the good sense to remain a bachelor.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Cynthia?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cynthia,” said Eve. The inconvenient Mrs. McTodd possessed a\r\nChristian name admirably adapted for being hissed between clenched\r\nteeth, and Eve hissed it in this fashion now. It became evident to\r\nPsmith that the dear girl was in a condition of hardly suppressed fury\r\nand that trouble was coming his way. He braced himself to meet it.\r\n\r\n“Directly after we had that talk on the lake, the day I arrived,”\r\ncontinued Eve tersely, “I wrote to Cynthia, telling her to come here at\r\nonce and meet me at the ‘Emsworth Arms’ . . .”\r\n\r\n“In the High Street,” said Psmith. “I know it. Good beer.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“I said they sell good beer . . .”\r\n\r\n“Never mind about the beer,” cried Eve.\r\n\r\n“No, no. I merely mentioned it in passing.”\r\n\r\n“At lunch to-day I got a letter from her saying that she would be there\r\nthis afternoon. So I hurried off. I wanted----” Eve laughed a hollow,\r\nmirthless laugh of a calibre which even the Hon. Freddie Threepwood\r\nwould have found beyond his powers, and he was a specialist--“I wanted\r\nto try to bring you two together. I thought that if I could see her and\r\nhave a talk with her that you might become reconciled.”\r\n\r\nPsmith, though obsessed with a disquieting feeling that he was fighting\r\nin the last ditch, pulled himself together sufficiently to pat her hand\r\nas it lay beside him on the wall like some white and fragile flower.\r\n\r\n“That was like you,” he murmured. “That was an act worthy of your great\r\nheart. But I fear that the rift between Cynthia and myself has reached\r\nsuch dimensions . . .”\r\n\r\nEve drew her hand away. She swung round, and the battery of her\r\nindignant gaze raked him furiously.\r\n\r\n“I saw Cynthia,” she said, “and she told me that her husband was in\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“Now, how in the world,” said Psmith, struggling bravely but with a\r\ngrowing sense that they were coming over the plate a bit too fast for\r\nhim, “how in the world did she get an idea like that?”\r\n\r\n“Do you really want to know?”\r\n\r\n“I do, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll tell you. She got the idea because she had had a letter from\r\nhim, begging her to join him there. She had just finished telling me\r\nthis, when I caught sight of you from the inn window, walking along\r\nthe High Street. I pointed you out to Cynthia, and she said she had\r\nnever seen you before in her life.”\r\n\r\n“Women soon forget,” sighed Psmith.\r\n\r\n“The only excuse I can find for you,” stormed Eve in a vibrant\r\nundertone necessitated by the fact that somebody had just emerged from\r\nthe castle door and they no longer had the terrace to themselves, “is\r\nthat you’re mad. When I think of all you said to me about poor Cynthia\r\non the lake that afternoon, when I think of all the sympathy I wasted\r\non you . . .”\r\n\r\n“Not wasted,” corrected Psmith firmly. “It was by no means wasted. It\r\nmade me love you--if possible--even more.”\r\n\r\nEve had supposed that she had embarked on a tirade which would last\r\nuntil she had worked off her indignation and felt composed again, but\r\nthis extraordinary remark scattered the thread of her harangue so\r\nhopelessly that all she could do was to stare at him in amazed silence.\r\n\r\n“Womanly intuition,” proceeded Psmith gravely, “will have told you long\r\nere this that I love you with a fervour which with my poor vocabulary\r\nI cannot hope to express. True, as you are about to say, we have known\r\neach other but a short time, as time is measured. But what of that?”\r\n\r\nEve raised her eyebrows. Her voice was cold and hostile.\r\n\r\n“After what has happened,” she said, “I suppose I ought not to be\r\nsurprised at finding you capable of anything, but--are you really\r\nchoosing this moment to--to propose to me?”\r\n\r\n“To employ a favourite word of your own--yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you expect me to take you seriously?”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly not. I look upon the present disclosure purely as a sighting\r\nshot. You may regard it, if you will, as a kind of formal proclamation.\r\nI wish simply to go on record as an aspirant to your hand. I want you,\r\nif you will be so good, to make a note of my words and give them a\r\nthought from time to time. As Comrade Cootes--a young friend of mine\r\nwhom you have not yet met--would say, ‘Chew on them.’”\r\n\r\n“I . . .”\r\n\r\n“It is possible,” continued Psmith, “that black moments will come to\r\nyou--for they come to all of us, even the sunniest--when you will find\r\nyourself saying, ‘Nobody loves me!’ On such occasions I should like\r\nyou to add, ‘No, I am wrong. There _is_ somebody who loves me.’ At\r\nfirst, it may be, that reflection will bring but scant balm. Gradually,\r\nhowever, as the days go by and we are constantly together and my nature\r\nunfolds itself before you like the petals of some timid flower beneath\r\nthe rays of the sun . . .”\r\n\r\nEve’s eyes opened wider. She had supposed herself incapable of further\r\nastonishment, but she saw that she had been mistaken.\r\n\r\n“You surely aren’t dreaming of staying on here _now_?” she gasped.\r\n\r\n“Most decidedly. Why not?”\r\n\r\n“But--but what is to prevent me telling everybody that you are not Mr.\r\nMcTodd?”\r\n\r\n“Your sweet, generous nature,” said Psmith. “Your big heart. Your\r\nangelic forbearance.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“Considering that I only came here as McTodd--and if you had seen\r\nhim you would realise that he is not a person for whom the man\r\nof sensibility and refinement would lightly allow himself to be\r\nmistaken--I say considering that I only took on the job of understudy\r\nso as to get to the castle and be near you, I hardly think that you\r\nwill be able to bring yourself to get me slung out. You must try to\r\nunderstand what happened. When Lord Emsworth started chatting with\r\nme under the impression that I was Comrade McTodd, I encouraged the\r\nmistake purely with the kindly intention of putting him at his ease.\r\nEven when he informed me that he was expecting me to come down to\r\nBlandings with him on the five o’clock train, it never occurred to\r\nme to do so. It was only when I saw you talking to him in the street\r\nand he revealed the fact that you were about to enjoy his hospitality\r\nthat I decided that there was no other course open to the man of\r\nspirit. Consider! Twice that day you had passed out of my life--may I\r\nsay taking the sunshine with you?--and I began to fear you might pass\r\nout of it for ever. So, loath though I was to commit the solecism of\r\nplanting myself in this happy home under false pretences, I could see\r\nno other way. And here I am!”\r\n\r\n“You _must_ be mad!”\r\n\r\n“Well, as I was saying, the days will go by, you will have ample\r\nopportunity of studying my personality, and it is quite possible that\r\nin due season the love of an honest heart may impress you as worth\r\nhaving. I may add that I have loved you since the moment when I saw\r\nyou sheltering from the rain under that awning in Dover Street, and I\r\nrecall saying as much to Comrade Walderwick when he was chatting with\r\nme some short time later on the subject of his umbrella. I do not press\r\nyou for an answer now . . .”\r\n\r\n“I should hope not!”\r\n\r\n“I merely say ‘Think it over.’ It is nothing to cause you mental\r\ndistress. Other men love you. Freddie Threepwood loves you. Just add me\r\nto the list. That is all I ask. Muse on me from time to time. Reflect\r\nthat I may be an acquired taste. You probably did not like olives the\r\nfirst time you tasted them. Now you probably do. Give me the same\r\nchance you would an olive. Consider, also, how little you actually have\r\nagainst me. What, indeed, does it amount to, when you come to examine\r\nit narrowly? All you have against me is the fact that I am not Ralston\r\nMcTodd. Think how comparatively few people _are_ Ralston McTodd. Let\r\nyour meditations proceed along these lines and . . .”\r\n\r\nHe broke off, for at this moment the individual who had come out of\r\nthe front door a short while back loomed beside them, and the glint of\r\nstarlight on glass revealed him as the Efficient Baxter.\r\n\r\n“Everybody is waiting, Mr. McTodd,” said the Efficient Baxter. He spoke\r\nthe name, as always, with a certain sardonic emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Psmith affably, “of course. I was forgetting. I will\r\nget to work at once. You are quite sure you do not wish to hear a\r\nscuttleful of modern poetry, Miss Halliday?”\r\n\r\n“Quite sure.”\r\n\r\n“And yet even now, so our genial friend here informs us, a bevy of\r\nyouth and beauty is crowding the drawing-room, agog for the treat.\r\nWell, well! It is these strange clashings of personal taste which\r\nconstitute what we call Life. I think I will write a poem about it\r\nsome day. Come, Comrade Baxter, let us be up and doing. I must not\r\ndisappoint my public.”\r\n\r\nFor some moments after the two had left her--Baxter silent and chilly,\r\nPsmith, all debonair chumminess, kneading the other’s arm and pointing\r\nout as they went objects of interest by the wayside--Eve remained\r\non the terrace wall, thinking. She was laughing now, but behind her\r\namusement there was another feeling, and one that perplexed her. A good\r\nmany men had proposed to her in the course of her career, but none of\r\nthem had ever left her with this odd feeling of exhilaration. Psmith\r\nwas different from any other man who had come her way, and difference\r\nwas a quality which Eve esteemed. . . .\r\n\r\nShe had just reached the conclusion that life for whatever girl might\r\neventually decide to risk it in Psmith’s company would never be dull,\r\nwhen strange doings in her immediate neighbourhood roused her from her\r\nmeditations.\r\n\r\nThe thing happened as she rose from her seat on the wall and started to\r\ncross the terrace on her way to the front door. She had stopped for an\r\ninstant beneath the huge open window of the drawing-room to listen to\r\nwhat was going on inside. Faintly, with something of the quality of a\r\nfar-off phonograph, the sound of Psmith reading came to her; and even\r\nat this distance there was a composed blandness about his voice which\r\nbrought a smile to her lips.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with a startling abruptness, the lighted window was dark. And\r\nshe was aware that all the lighted windows on that side of the castle\r\nhad suddenly become dark. The lamp that shone over the great door\r\nceased to shine. And above the hubbub of voices in the drawing-room she\r\nheard Psmith’s patient drawl.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen, I think the lights have gone out.”\r\n\r\nThe night air was rent by a single piercing scream. Something flashed\r\nlike a shooting star and fell at her feet; and, stooping, Eve found in\r\nher hands Lady Constance Keeble’s diamond necklace.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5\r\n\r\nTo be prepared is everything in this life. Ever since her talk with Mr.\r\nJoseph Keeble in the High Street of Market Blandings that afternoon\r\nEve’s mind had been flitting nimbly from one scheme to another, all\r\ndesigned to end in this very act of seizing the necklace in her hands\r\nand each rendered impracticable by some annoying flaw. And now that\r\nFate in its impulsive way had achieved for her what she had begun to\r\nfeel she could never accomplish for herself, she wasted no time in\r\nbewildered inaction. The miracle found her ready for it.\r\n\r\nFor an instant she debated with herself the chances of a dash through\r\nthe darkened hall up the stairs to her room. But the lights might go\r\non again, and she might meet someone. Memories of sensational novels\r\nread in the past told her that on occasions such as this people were\r\ndetained and searched. . . .\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as she stood there, she found the way. Close beside her,\r\nlying on its side, was the flower-pot which Psmith had overturned as he\r\ncame to join her on the terrace wall. It might have defects as a cache,\r\nbut at the moment she could perceive none. Most flower-pots are alike,\r\nbut this was a particularly easily-remembered flower-pot: for in its\r\njourneying from the potting shed to the terrace it had acquired on its\r\nside a splash of white paint. She would be able to distinguish it from\r\nits fellows when, late that night, she crept out to retrieve the spoil.\r\nAnd surely nobody would ever think of suspecting . . .\r\n\r\nShe plunged her fingers into the soft mould, and straightened herself,\r\nbreathing quickly. It was not an ideal piece of work, but it would\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nShe rubbed her fingers on the turf, put the flower-pot back in the row\r\nwith the others, and then, like a flying white phantom, darted across\r\nthe terrace and into the house. And so with beating heart, groping her\r\nway, to the bathroom to wash her hands.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-thousand-pound flower-pot looked placidly up at the winking\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps two minutes later that Mr. Cootes, sprinting lustily,\r\nrounded the corner of the house and burst on to the terrace. Late as\r\nusual."
