I could hear nothing but\r\nan occasional 'Biggest I ever saw in my life!' and 'Fully as large as\r\nthat!' but in such a place it was not difficult to imagine the rest;\r\nand when the second man, catching my eye, winked at me with a sort of\r\nhumorous misery, I smiled sympathetically back at him.\r\n\r\nThe action had the effect of establishing a bond between us; and when\r\nthe story-teller finished his tale and left, he came over to my table\r\nas if answering a formal invitation.\r\n\r\n'Dreadful liars some men are,' he said genially.\r\n\r\n'Fishermen,' I suggested, 'are traditionally careless of the truth.'\r\n\r\n'He wasn't a fisherman,' said my companion. 'That was our local doctor.\r\nHe was telling me about his latest case of dropsy. Besides'--he tapped\r\nme earnestly on the knee--'you must not fall into the popular error\r\nabout fishermen. Tradition has maligned them. I am a fisherman myself,\r\nand I have never told a lie in my life.'\r\n\r\nI could well believe it. He was a short, stout, comfortable man of\r\nmiddle age, and the thing that struck me first about him was the\r\nextraordinary childlike candour of his eyes. They were large and round\r\nand honest. I would have bought oil stock from him without a tremor.\r\n\r\nThe door leading into the white dusty road opened, and a small man with\r\nrimless pince-nez and an anxious expression shot in like a rabbit and\r\nhad consumed a gin and ginger-beer almost before we knew he was there.\r\nHaving thus refreshed himself, he stood looking at us, seemingly ill at\r\nease.\r\n\r\n'N-n-n-n-n-n--' he said.\r\n\r\nWe looked at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n'N-n-n-n-n-n-ice d-d-d-d--'\r\n\r\nHis nerve appeared to fail him, and he vanished as abruptly as he had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n'I think he was leading up to telling us that it was a nice day,'\r\nhazarded my companion.\r\n\r\n'It must be very embarrassing,' I said, 'for a man with such a painful\r\nimpediment in his speech to open conversation with strangers.'\r\n\r\n'Probably trying to cure himself. Like my nephew George. Have I ever\r\ntold you about my nephew George?'\r\n\r\nI reminded him that we had only just met, and that this was the first\r\ntime I had learned that he had a nephew George.\r\n\r\n'Young George Mulliner. My name is Mulliner. I will tell you about\r\nGeorge's case--in many ways a rather remarkable one.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy nephew George (said Mr Mulliner) was as nice a young fellow as\r\nyou would ever wish to meet, but from childhood up he had been\r\ncursed with a terrible stammer. If he had had to earn his living, he\r\nwould undoubtedly have found this affliction a great handicap, but\r\nfortunately his father had left him a comfortable income; and George\r\nspent a not unhappy life, residing in the village where he had been\r\nborn and passing his days in the usual country sports and his evenings\r\nin doing cross-word puzzles. By the time he was thirty he knew more\r\nabout Eli, the prophet, Ra, the Sun God, and the bird Emu than anybody\r\nelse in the county except Susan Blake, the vicar's daughter, who had\r\nalso taken up the solving of cross-word puzzles and was the first\r\ngirl in Worcestershire to find out the meaning of 'stearine' and\r\n'crepuscular'.\r\n\r\nIt was his association with Miss Blake that first turned George's\r\nthoughts to a serious endeavour to cure himself of his stammer.\r\nNaturally, with this hobby in common, the young people saw a great deal\r\nof one another: for George was always looking in at the vicarage to\r\nask her if she knew a word of seven letters meaning 'appertaining to\r\nthe profession of plumbing', and Susan was just as constant a caller\r\nat George's cosy little cottage, being frequently stumped, as girls\r\nwill be, by words of eight letters signifying 'largely used in the\r\nmanufacture of poppet-valves'. The consequence was that one evening,\r\njust after she had helped him out of a tight place with the word\r\n'disestablishmentarianism', the boy suddenly awoke to the truth and\r\nrealized that she was all the world to him--or, as he put it to himself\r\nfrom force of habit, precious, beloved, darling, much-loved, highly\r\nesteemed or valued.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, every time he tried to tell her so, he could get no further\r\nthan a sibilant gurgle which was no more practical use than a hiccup.\r\n\r\nSomething obviously had to be done, and George went to London to see a\r\nspecialist.\r\n\r\n'Yes?' said the specialist.\r\n\r\n'I-I-I-I-I-I-I--' said George.\r\n\r\n'You were saying--?'\r\n\r\n'Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo--'\r\n\r\n'Sing it,' said the specialist.\r\n\r\n'S-s-s-s-s-s-s-s--?' said George, puzzled.\r\n\r\nThe specialist explained. He was a kindly man with moth-eaten whiskers\r\nand an eye like a meditative cod-fish.\r\n\r\n'Many people,' he said, 'who are unable to articulate clearly in\r\nordinary speech find themselves lucid and bell-like when they burst\r\ninto song.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed a good idea to George. He thought for a moment; then threw\r\nhis head back, shut his eyes, and let it go in a musical baritone.\r\n\r\n'I love a lassie, a bonny, bonny lassie,' sang George. 'She's as pure\r\nas the lily in the dell.'\r\n\r\n'No doubt,' said the specialist, wincing a little.\r\n\r\n'She's as sweet as the heather, the bonny purple heather--Susan, my\r\nWorcestershire bluebell.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said the specialist. 'Sounds a nice girl. Is this she?' he asked,\r\nadjusting his glasses and peering at the photograph which George had\r\nextracted from the interior of the left side of his under-vest.\r\n\r\nGeorge nodded, and drew in breath.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' he carolled, 'that's my baby. No, sir, don't mean maybe.\r\nYes, sir, that's my baby now. And, by the way, by the way, when I meet\r\nthat preacher I shall say--\"Yes, sir, that's my--\"'\r\n\r\n'Quite,' said the specialist, hurriedly. He had a sensitive ear.\r\n'Quite, quite.'\r\n\r\n'If you knew Susie like I know Susie,' George was beginning, but the\r\nother stopped him.\r\n\r\n'Quite. Exactly. I shouldn't wonder. And now,' said the specialist,\r\n'what precisely is the trouble? No,' he added, hastily, as George\r\ninflated his lungs, 'don't sing it. Write the particulars on this piece\r\nof paper.'\r\n\r\nGeorge did so.\r\n\r\n'H'm!' said the specialist, examining the screed. 'You wish to woo,\r\ncourt, and become betrothed, engaged, affianced to this girl, but you\r\nfind yourself unable, incapable, incompetent, impotent, and powerless.\r\nEvery time you attempt it, your vocal cords fail, fall short, are\r\ninsufficient, wanting, deficient, and go blooey.'\r\n\r\nGeorge nodded.\r\n\r\n'A not unusual case. I have had to deal with this sort of thing before.\r\nThe effect of love on the vocal cords of even a normally eloquent\r\nsubject is frequently deleterious. As regards the habitual stammerer,\r\ntests have shown that in ninety-seven point five six nine recurring of\r\ncases the divine passion reduces him to a condition where he sounds\r\nlike a soda-water siphon trying to recite _Gunga Din_. There is\r\nonly one cure.'\r\n\r\n'W-w-w-w-w--?' asked George.\r\n\r\n'I will tell you. Stammering,' proceeded the specialist, putting\r\nthe tips of his fingers together and eyeing George benevolently,\r\n'is mainly mental and is caused by shyness, which is caused by the\r\ninferiority complex, which in its turn is caused by suppressed desires\r\nor introverted inhibitions or something. The advice I give to all young\r\nmen who come in here behaving like soda-water siphons is to go out and\r\nmake a point of speaking to at least three perfect strangers every\r\nday. Engage these strangers in conversation, persevering no matter how\r\npriceless a chump you may feel, and before many weeks are out you will\r\nfind that the little daily dose has had its effect. Shyness will wear\r\noff, and with it the stammer.'\r\n\r\nAnd, having requested the young man--in a voice of the clearest timbre,\r\nfree from all trace of impediment--to hand over a fee of five guineas,\r\nthe specialist sent George out into the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe more George thought about the advice he had been given, the less\r\nhe liked it. He shivered in the cab that took him to the station to\r\ncatch the train back to East Wobsley. Like all shy young men, he had\r\nnever hitherto looked upon himself as shy--preferring to attribute his\r\ndistaste for the society of his fellows to some subtle rareness of\r\nsoul. But now that the thing had been put squarely up to him, he was\r\ncompelled to realize that in all essentials he was a perfect rabbit.\r\nThe thought of accosting perfect strangers and forcing his conversation\r\nupon them sickened him.\r\n\r\nBut no Mulliner has ever shirked an unpleasant duty. As he reached the\r\nplatform and strode along it to the train, his teeth were set, his eyes\r\nshone with an almost fanatical light of determination, and he intended\r\nbefore his journey was over to conduct three heart-to-heart chats if he\r\nhad to sing every bar of them.\r\n\r\nThe compartment into which he had made his way was empty at the moment,\r\nbut just before the train started a very large, fierce-looking man got\r\nin. George would have preferred somebody a little less formidable for\r\nhis first subject, but he braced himself and bent forward. And, as he\r\ndid so, the man spoke.\r\n\r\n'The wur-wur-wur-wur-weather', he said, 'sus-sus-seems to be\r\nter-ter-taking a tur-tur-turn for the ber-ber-better, der-doesn't it?'\r\n\r\nGeorge sank back as if he had been hit between the eyes. The train had\r\nmoved out of the dimness of the station by now, and the sun was shining\r\nbrightly on the speaker, illuminating his knobbly shoulders, his craggy\r\njaw, and, above all, the shockingly choleric look in his eyes. The\r\nreply 'Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yes' to such a man would obviously be madness.\r\n\r\nBut to abstain from speech did not seem to be much better as a policy.\r\nGeorge's silence appeared to arouse this man's worst passions. His face\r\nhad turned purple and he glared painfully.\r\n\r\n'I uk-uk-asked you a sus-sus-civil quk-quk-quk,' he said, irascibly.\r\n'Are you d-d-d-d-deaf?'\r\n\r\nAll we Mulliners have been noted for our presence of mind. To open his\r\nmouth, point to his tonsils, and utter a strangled gurgle was with\r\nGeorge the work of a moment.\r\n\r\nThe tension relaxed. The man's annoyance abated.\r\n\r\n'D-d-d-dumb?' he said, commiseratingly. 'I beg your p-p-p-p-pup.\r\nI t-t-trust I have not caused you p-p-p-p-pup. It m-must\r\nbe tut-tut-tut-tut-tut not to be able to sus-sus-speak\r\nfuf-fuf-fuf-fuf-fluently.'\r\n\r\nHe then buried himself in his paper, and George sank back in his\r\ncorner, quivering in every limb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo get to East Wobsley, as you doubtless know, you have to change\r\nat Ippleton and take the branch-line. By the time the train reached\r\nthis junction, George's composure was somewhat restored. He deposited\r\nhis belongings in a compartment of the East Wobsley train, which was\r\nwaiting in a glued manner on the other side of the platform, and,\r\nfinding that it would not start for some ten minutes, decided to pass\r\nthe time by strolling up and down in the pleasant air.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely afternoon. The sun was gilding the platform with its\r\nrays, and a gentle breeze blew from the west. A little brook ran\r\ntinkling at the side of the road; birds were singing in the hedgerows;\r\nand through the trees could be discerned dimly the noble façade of the\r\nCounty Lunatic Asylum. Soothed by his surroundings, George began to\r\nfeel so refreshed that he regretted that in this wayside station there\r\nwas no one present whom he could engage in talk.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that the distinguished-looking stranger entered\r\nthe platform.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer was a man of imposing physique, simply dressed in\r\npyjamas, brown boots, and a mackintosh. In his hand he carried a\r\ntop-hat, and into this he was dipping his fingers, taking them out, and\r\nthen waving them in a curious manner to right and left. He nodded so\r\naffably to George that the latter, though a little surprised at the\r\nother's costume, decided to speak. After all, he reflected, clothes do\r\nnot make the man, and, judging from the other's smile, a warm heart\r\nappeared to beat beneath that orange-and-mauve striped pyjama jacket.\r\n\r\n'N-n-n-n-nice weather,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Glad you like it,' said the stranger. 'I ordered it specially.'\r\n\r\nGeorge was a little puzzled by this remark, but he persevered.\r\n\r\n'M-might I ask wur-wur-what you are dud-doing?'\r\n\r\n'Doing?'\r\n\r\n'With that her-her-her-her-hat?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, with this hat? I see what you mean. Just scattering largesse to\r\nthe multitude,' replied the stranger, dipping his fingers once more\r\nand waving them with a generous gesture. 'Devil of a bore, but it's\r\nexpected of a man in my position. The fact is,' he said, linking his\r\narm in George's and speaking in a confidential undertone, 'I'm the\r\nEmperor of Abyssinia. That's my palace over there,' he said, pointing\r\nthrough the trees. 'Don't let it go any further. It's not supposed to\r\nbe generally known.'\r\n\r\nIt was with a rather sickly smile that George now endeavoured to\r\nwithdraw his arm from that of his companion, but the other would have\r\nnone of this aloofness. He seemed to be in complete agreement with\r\nShakespeare's dictum that a friend, when found, should be grappled to\r\nyou with hooks of steel. He held George in a vise-like grip and drew\r\nhim into a recess of the platform. He looked about him, and seemed\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n'We are alone at last,' he said.\r\n\r\nThis fact had already impressed itself with sickening clearness on the\r\nyoung man. There are few spots in the civilized world more deserted\r\nthan the platform of a small country station. The sun shone on the\r\nsmooth asphalt, on the gleaming rails, and on the machine which, in\r\nexchange for a penny placed in the slot marked 'Matches', would supply\r\na package of wholesome butter-scotch--but on nothing else.\r\n\r\nWhat George could have done with at the moment was a posse of police\r\narmed with stout clubs, and there was not even a dog in sight.\r\n\r\n'I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time,' said the stranger,\r\ngenially.\r\n\r\n'Huh-huh-have you?' said George.\r\n\r\n'Yes. I want your opinion of human sacrifices.'\r\n\r\nGeorge said he didn't like them.\r\n\r\n'Why not?' asked the other, surprised.\r\n\r\nGeorge said it was hard to explain. He just didn't.\r\n\r\n'Well, I think you're wrong,' said the Emperor. 'I know there's a\r\nschool of thought growing up that holds your views, but I disapprove\r\nof it. I hate all this modern advanced thought. Human sacrifices have\r\nalways been good enough for the Emperors of Abyssinia, and they're good\r\nenough for me. Kindly step in here, if you please.'\r\n\r\nHe indicated the lamp-and-mop room, at which they had now arrived.\r\nIt was a dark and sinister apartment, smelling strongly of oil and\r\nporters, and was probably the last place on earth in which George would\r\nhave wished to be closeted with a man of such peculiar views. He shrank\r\nback.\r\n\r\n'You go in first,' he said.\r\n\r\n'No larks,' said the other, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n'L-l-l-l-larks?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. No pushing a fellow in and locking the door and squirting water\r\nat him through the window. I've had that happen to me before.'\r\n\r\n'Sus-certainly not.'\r\n\r\n'Right!' said the Emperor. 'You're a gentleman and I'm a gentleman.\r\nBoth gentlemen. Have you a knife, by the way? We shall need a knife.'\r\n\r\n'No. No knife.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, well,' said the Emperor, 'then we'll have to look about for\r\nsomething else. No doubt we shall manage somehow.'\r\n\r\nAnd with the debonair manner which so became him, he scattered another\r\nhandful of largesse and walked into the lamp-room.\r\n\r\nIt was not the fact that he had given his word as a gentleman that\r\nkept George from locking the door. There is probably no family on\r\nearth more nicely scrupulous as regards keeping its promises than the\r\nMulliners, but I am compelled to admit that, had George been able to\r\nfind the key, he would have locked that door without hesitation. Not\r\nbeing able to find the key, he had to be satisfied with banging it.\r\nThis done, he leaped back and raced away down the platform. A confused\r\nnoise within seemed to indicate that the Emperor had become involved\r\nwith some lamps.\r\n\r\nGeorge made the best of the respite. Covering the ground at a high rate\r\nof speed, he flung himself into the train and took refuge under the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThere he remained, quaking. At one time he thought that his uncongenial\r\nacquaintance had got upon his track, for the door of the compartment\r\nopened and a cool wind blew in upon him. Then, glancing along the\r\nfloor, he perceived feminine ankles. The relief was enormous, but even\r\nin his relief George, who was the soul of modesty, did not forget his\r\nmanners. He closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nA voice spoke.\r\n\r\n'Porter!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, ma'am?'\r\n\r\n'What was all that disturbance as I came into the station?'\r\n\r\n'Patient escaped from the asylum, ma'am.'\r\n\r\n'Good gracious!'\r\n\r\nThe voice would undoubtedly have spoken further, but at this moment the\r\ntrain began to move. There came the sound of a body descending upon a\r\ncushioned seat, and some little time later the rustling of a paper. The\r\ntrain gathered speed and jolted on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge had never before travelled under the seat of a railway carriage;\r\nand, though he belonged to the younger generation, which is supposed\r\nto be so avid of new experiences, he had no desire to do so now. He\r\ndecided to emerge, and, if possible, to emerge with the minimum of\r\nostentation. Little as he knew of women, he was aware that as a sex\r\nthey are apt to be startled by the sight of men crawling out from under\r\nthe seats of compartments. He began his manoeuvres by poking out his\r\nhead and surveying the terrain.\r\n\r\nAll was well. The woman, in her seat across the way, was engrossed in\r\nher paper. Moving in a series of noiseless wriggles, George extricated\r\nhimself from his hiding-place and, with a twist which would have been\r\nimpossible to a man not in the habit of doing Swedish exercises daily\r\nbefore breakfast, heaved himself into the corner seat. The woman\r\ncontinued reading her paper.\r\n\r\nThe events of the past quarter of an hour had tended rather to drive\r\nfrom George's mind the mission which he had undertaken on leaving\r\nthe specialist's office. But now, having leisure for reflection, he\r\nrealized that, if he meant to complete his first day of the cure, he\r\nwas allowing himself to run sadly behind schedule. Speak to three\r\nstrangers, the specialist had told him, and up to the present he had\r\nspoken to only one. True, this one had been a pretty considerable\r\nstranger, and a less conscientious young man than George Mulliner might\r\nhave considered himself justified in chalking him up on the scoreboard\r\nas one and a half or even two. But George had the dogged, honest\r\nMulliner streak in him, and he refused to quibble.\r\n\r\nHe nerved himself for action, and cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n'Ah-h'rm!' said George.\r\n\r\nAnd, having opened the ball, he smiled a winning smile and waited for\r\nhis companion to make the next move.\r\n\r\nThe move which his companion made was in an upwards direction, and\r\nmeasured from six to eight inches. She dropped her paper and regarded\r\nGeorge with a pale-eyed horror. One pictures her a little in the\r\nposition of Robinson Crusoe when he saw the footprint in the sand. She\r\nhad been convinced that she was completely alone, and lo! out of space\r\na voice had spoken to her. Her face worked, but she made no remark.\r\n\r\nGeorge, on his side, was also feeling a little ill at ease. Women\r\nalways increased his natural shyness. He never knew what to say to them.\r\n\r\nThen a happy thought struck him. He had just glanced at his watch and\r\nfound the hour to be nearly four-thirty. Women, he knew, loved a drop\r\nof tea at about this time, and fortunately there was in his suit-case a\r\nfull thermos-flask.\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, but I wonder if you would care for a cup of tea?' was\r\nwhat he wanted to say, but, as so often happened with him when in the\r\npresence of the opposite sex, he could get no further than a sort of\r\nsizzling sound like a cockroach calling to its young.\r\n\r\nThe woman continued to stare at him. Her eyes were now about the size\r\nof regulation standard golf-balls, and her breathing suggested the last\r\nstages of asthma. And it was at this point that George, struggling\r\nfor speech, had one of those inspirations which frequently come to\r\nMulliners. There flashed into his mind what the specialist had told him\r\nabout singing. Say it with music--that was the thing to do.\r\n\r\nHe delayed no longer.\r\n\r\n'Tea for two and two for tea and me for you and you for me--'\r\n\r\nHe was shocked to observe his companion turning Nile-green. He decided\r\nto make his meaning clearer.\r\n\r\n'I have a nice thermos. I have a full thermos. Won't you share my\r\nthermos, too? When skies are grey and you feel you are blue, tea sends\r\nthe sun smiling through. I have a nice thermos. I have a full thermos.\r\nMay I pour out some for you?'\r\n\r\nYou will agree with me, I think, that no invitation could have been\r\nmore happily put, but his companion was not responsive. With one\r\nlast agonized look at him, she closed her eyes and sank back in her\r\nseat. Her lips had now turned a curious grey-blue colour, and they\r\nwere moving feebly. She reminded George, who, like myself, was a keen\r\nfisherman, of a newly-gaffed salmon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge sat back in his corner, brooding. Rack his brain as he might, he\r\ncould think of no topic which could be guaranteed to interest, elevate,\r\nand amuse. He looked out of the window with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThe train was now approaching the dear old familiar East Wobsley\r\ncountry. He began to recognize landmarks. A wave of sentiment poured\r\nover George as he thought of Susan, and he reached for the bag of buns\r\nwhich he had bought at the refreshment room at Ippleton. Sentiment\r\nalways made him hungry.\r\n\r\nHe took his thermos out of the suit-case, and, unscrewing the top,\r\npoured himself out a cup of tea. Then, placing the thermos on the seat,\r\nhe drank.\r\n\r\nHe looked across at his companion. Her eyes were still closed, and she\r\nuttered little sighing noises. George was half-inclined to renew his\r\noffer of tea, but the only tune he could remember was _Hard-Hearted\r\nHanna, the Vamp from Savannah_, and it was difficult to fit suitable\r\nwords to it. He ate his bun and gazed out at the familiar scenery.\r\n\r\nNow, as you approach East Wobsley, the train, I must mention, has to\r\npass over some points; and so violent is the sudden jerking that strong\r\nmen have been known to spill their beer. George, forgetting this in his\r\npreoccupation, had placed the thermos only a few inches from the edge\r\nof the seat. The result was that, as the train reached the points, the\r\nflask leaped like a live thing, dived to the floor, and exploded.\r\n\r\nEven George was distinctly upset by the sudden sharpness of the report.\r\nHis bun sprang from his hand and was dashed to fragments. He blinked\r\nthrice in rapid succession. His heart tried to jump out of his mouth\r\nand loosened a front tooth.\r\n\r\nBut on the woman opposite the effect of the untoward occurrence was\r\nstill more marked. With a single piercing shriek, she rose from her\r\nseat straight into the air like a rocketing pheasant; and, having\r\nclutched the communication-cord, fell back again. Impressive as her\r\nprevious leap had been, she excelled it now by several inches. I do\r\nnot know what the existing record for the Sitting High-Jump is, but\r\nshe undoubtedly lowered it; and if George had been a member of the\r\nOlympic Games Selection Committee, he would have signed this woman up\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing that, in spite of the railway companies' sporting\r\nwillingness to let their patrons have a tug at the extremely moderate\r\nprice of five pounds a go, very few people have ever either pulled a\r\ncommunication-cord or seen one pulled. There is, thus, a widespread\r\nignorance as to what precisely happens on such occasions.\r\n\r\nThe procedure, George tells me, is as follows: First there comes a\r\ngrinding noise, as the brakes are applied. Then the train stops. And\r\nfinally, from every point of the compass, a seething mob of interested\r\nonlookers begins to appear.\r\n\r\nIt was about a mile and a half from East Wobsley that the affair had\r\ntaken place, and as far as the eye could reach the country-side was\r\ntotally devoid of humanity. A moment before nothing had been visible\r\nbut smiling cornfields and broad pasture-lands; but now from east,\r\nwest, north, and south running figures began to appear. We must\r\nremember that George at the time was in a somewhat overwrought frame of\r\nmind, and his statements should therefore be accepted with caution; but\r\nhe tells me that out of the middle of a single empty meadow, entirely\r\ndevoid of cover, no fewer than twenty-seven distinct rustics suddenly\r\nappeared, having undoubtedly shot up through the ground.\r\n\r\nThe rails, which had been completely unoccupied, were now thronged\r\nwith so dense a crowd of navvies that it seemed to George absurd to\r\npretend that there was any unemployment in England. Every member of\r\nthe labouring classes throughout the country was so palpably present.\r\nMoreover, the train, which at Ippleton had seemed sparsely occupied,\r\nwas disgorging passengers from every door. It was the sort of mob-scene\r\nwhich would have made David W. Griffith scream with delight; and it\r\nlooked, George says, like Guest Night at the Royal Automobile Club.\r\nBut, as I say, we must remember that he was overwrought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say what precisely would have been the correct\r\nbehaviour of your polished man of the world in such a situation. I\r\nthink myself that a great deal of sang-froid and address would be\r\nrequired even by the most self-possessed in order to pass off such a\r\ncontretemps. To George, I may say at once, the crisis revealed itself\r\nimmediately as one which he was totally incapable of handling. The\r\none clear thought that stood out from the welter of his emotions was\r\nthe reflection that it was advisable to remove himself, and to do so\r\nwithout delay. Drawing a deep breath, he shot swiftly off the mark.\r\n\r\nAll we Mulliners have been athletes; and George, when at the\r\nUniversity, had been noted for his speed of foot. He ran now as he had\r\nnever run before. His statement, however, that as he sprinted across\r\nthe first field he distinctly saw a rabbit shoot an envious glance at\r\nhim as he passed and shrug its shoulders hopelessly, I am inclined to\r\ndiscount. George, as I have said before, was a little over-excited.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is not to be questioned that he made good going. And\r\nhe had need to, for after the first instant of surprise, which had\r\nenabled him to secure a lead, the whole mob was pouring across country\r\nafter him; and dimly, as he ran, he could hear voices in the throng\r\ninformally discussing the advisability of lynching him. Moreover, the\r\nfield through which he was running, a moment before a bare expanse of\r\ngreen, was now black with figures, headed by a man with a beard who\r\ncarried a pitchfork. George swerved sharply to the right, casting a\r\nswift glance over his shoulder at his pursuers. He disliked them all,\r\nbut especially the man with the pitchfork.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for one who was not an eye-witness to say how\r\nlong the chase continued and how much ground was covered by the\r\ninterested parties. I know the East Wobsley country well, and I have\r\nchecked George's statements; and, if it is true that he travelled\r\neast as far as Little Wigmarsh-in-the-Dell and as far west as\r\nHiggleford-cum-Wortlebury-beneath-the-Hill, he must undoubtedly have\r\ndone a lot of running.\r\n\r\nBut a point which must not be forgotten is that, to a man\r\nnot in a condition to observe closely, the village of\r\nHiggleford-cum-Wortlebury-beneath-the-Hill might easily not have been\r\nHiggleford-cum-Wortlebury-beneath-the-Hill at all, but another hamlet\r\nwhich in many respects closely resembles it. I need scarcely say that I\r\nallude to Lesser-Snodsbury-in-the-Vale.\r\n\r\nLet us assume, therefore, that George, having touched\r\nLittle-Wigmarsh-in-the-Dell, shot off at a tangent and reached\r\nLesser-Snodsbury-in-the-Vale. This would be a considerable run. And,\r\nas he remembers flitting past Farmer Higgins's pigsty and the Dog and\r\nDuck at Pondlebury Parva and splashing through the brook Wipple at\r\nthe point where it joins the River Wopple, we can safely assume that,\r\nwherever else he went, he got plenty of exercise.\r\n\r\nBut the pleasantest of functions must end, and, just as the setting\r\nsun was gilding the spire of the ivy-covered church of St Barnabas the\r\nResilient, where George as a child had sat so often, enlivening the\r\ntedium of the sermon by making faces at the choir-boys, a damp and\r\nbedraggled figure might have been observed crawling painfully along the\r\nHigh Street of East Wobsley in the direction of the cosy little cottage\r\nknown to its builder as Chatsworth and to the village tradesmen as\r\n'Mulliner's'.\r\n\r\nIt was George, home from the hunting-field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlowly George Mulliner made his way to the familiar door, and, passing\r\nthrough it, flung himself into his favourite chair. But a moment later\r\na more imperious need than the desire to rest forced itself upon his\r\nattention. Rising stiffly, he tottered to the kitchen and mixed himself\r\na revivifying whisky-and-soda. Then, refilling his glass, he returned\r\nto the sitting-room, to find that it was no longer empty. A slim, fair\r\ngirl, tastefully attired in tailor-made tweeds, was leaning over the\r\ndesk on which he kept his _Dictionary of English Synonyms_.\r\n\r\nShe looked up as he entered, startled.\r\n\r\n'Why, Mr Mulliner!' she exclaimed. 'What has been happening? Your\r\nclothes are torn, rent, ragged, tattered, and your hair is all\r\ndishevelled, untrimmed, hanging loose or negligently, at loose ends!'\r\n\r\nGeorge smiled a wan smile.\r\n\r\n'You are right,' he said. 'And, what is more, I am suffering from\r\nextreme fatigue, weariness, lassitude, exhaustion, prostration, and\r\nlanguor.'\r\n\r\nThe girl gazed at him, a divine pity in her soft eyes.\r\n\r\n'I'm so sorry,' she murmured. 'So very sorry, grieved, distressed,\r\nafflicted, pained, mortified, dejected, and upset.'\r\n\r\nGeorge took her hand. Her sweet sympathy had effected the cure for\r\nwhich he had been seeking so long. Coming on top of the violent\r\nemotions through which he had been passing all day, it seemed to work\r\non him like some healing spell, charm, or incantation. Suddenly, in a\r\nflash, he realized that he was no longer a stammerer. Had he wished at\r\nthat moment to say, 'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,' he\r\ncould have done it without a second thought.\r\n\r\nBut he had better things to say than that.\r\n\r\n'Miss Blake--Susan--Susie.' He took her other hand in his. His voice\r\nrang out clear and unimpeded. It seemed to him incredible that he had\r\never yammered at this girl like an over-heated steam-radiator. 'It\r\ncannot have escaped your notice that I have long entertained towards\r\nyou sentiments warmer and deeper than those of ordinary friendship. It\r\nis love, Susan, that has been animating my bosom. Love, first a tiny\r\nseed, has burgeoned in my heart till, blazing into flame, it has swept\r\naway on the crest of its wave my diffidence, my doubt, my fears, and\r\nmy foreboding, and now, like the topmost topaz of some ancient tower,\r\nit cries to all the world in a voice of thunder: \"You are mine! My\r\nmate! Predestined to me since Time first began!\" As the star guides\r\nthe mariner when, battered by boiling billows, he hies him home to the\r\nhaven of hope and happiness, so do you gleam upon me along life's rough\r\nroad and seem to say, \"Have courage, George! I am here!\" Susan, I am\r\nnot an eloquent man--I cannot speak fluently as I could wish--but these\r\nsimple words which you have just heard come from the heart, from the\r\nunspotted heart of an English gentleman. Susan, I love you. Will you be\r\nmy wife, married woman, matron, spouse, help-meet, consort, partner, or\r\nbetter half?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, George!' said Susan. 'Yes, yea, ay, aye! Decidedly,\r\nunquestionably, indubitably, incontrovertibly, and past all dispute!'\r\n\r\nHe folded her in his arms. And, as he did so, there came from the\r\nstreet outside--faintly, as from a distance--the sound of feet and\r\nvoices. George leaped to the window. Rounding the corner, just by the\r\nCow and Wheelbarrow public-house, licensed to sell ales, wines, and\r\nspirits, was the man with the pitchfork, and behind him followed a vast\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n'My darling,' said George, 'for purely personal and private reasons,\r\ninto which I need not enter, I must now leave you. Will you join me\r\nlater?'\r\n\r\n'I will follow you to the ends of the earth,' replied Susan,\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\n'It will not be necessary,' said George. 'I am only going down to the\r\ncoal-cellar. I shall spend the next half-hour or so there. If anybody\r\ncalls and asks for me, perhaps you would not mind telling them that I\r\nam out.'\r\n\r\n'I will, I will,' said Susan. 'And, George, by the way. What I really\r\ncame here for was to ask you if you knew a hyphenated word of nine\r\nletters, ending in k and signifying an implement employed in the\r\npursuit of agriculture.'\r\n\r\n'Pitchfork, sweetheart,' said George. 'But you may take it from me,\r\nas one who knows, that agriculture isn't the only thing it is used in\r\npursuit of.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd since that day (concluded Mr Mulliner) George, believe me or\r\nbelieve me not, has not had the slightest trace of an impediment in his\r\nspeech. He is now the chosen orator at all political rallies for miles\r\naround; and so offensively self-confident has his manner become that\r\nonly last Friday he had his eye blacked by a hay-corn-and-feed merchant\r\nof the name of Stubbs. It just shows you, doesn't it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\n                            A SLICE OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conversation in the bar-parlour of the Anglers' Rest had drifted\r\nround to the subject of the Arts: and somebody asked if that\r\nfilm-serial, _The Vicissitudes of Vera_, which they were showing\r\ndown at the Bijou Dream, was worth seeing.\r\n\r\n'It's very good,' said Miss Postlethwaite, our courteous and efficient\r\nbarmaid, who is a prominent first-nighter. 'It's about this mad\r\nprofessor who gets this girl into his toils and tries to turn her into\r\na lobster.'\r\n\r\n'Tries to turn her into a lobster?' echoed we, surprised.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Into a lobster. It seems he collected thousands and\r\nthousands of lobsters and mashed them up and boiled down the juice from\r\ntheir glands and was just going to inject it into this Vera Dalrymple's\r\nspinal column when Jack Frobisher broke into the house and stopped him.'\r\n\r\n'Why did he do that?'\r\n\r\n'Because he didn't want the girl he loved to be turned into a lobster.'\r\n\r\n'What we mean,' said we, 'is why did the professor want to turn the\r\ngirl into a lobster?'\r\n\r\n'He had a grudge against her.'\r\n\r\nThis seemed plausible, and we thought it over for a while. Then one of\r\nthe company shook his head disapprovingly.\r\n\r\n'I don't like stories like that,' he said. 'They aren't true to life.'\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, sir,' said a voice. And we were aware of Mr Mulliner in our\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\n'Excuse me interrupting what may be a private discussion,' said Mr\r\nMulliner, 'but I chanced to overhear the recent remarks, and you, sir,\r\nhave opened up a subject on which I happen to hold strong views--to\r\nwit, the question of what is and what is not true to life. How can we,\r\nwith our limited experience, answer that question? For all we know, at\r\nthis very moment hundreds of young women all over the country may be\r\nin the process of being turned into lobsters. Forgive my warmth, but I\r\nhave suffered a good deal from this sceptical attitude of mind which is\r\nso prevalent nowadays. I have even met people who refused to believe my\r\nstory about my brother Wilfred, purely because it was a little out of\r\nthe ordinary run of the average man's experience.'\r\n\r\nConsiderably moved, Mr Mulliner ordered a hot Scotch with a slice of\r\nlemon.\r\n\r\n'What happened to your brother Wilfred? Was he turned into a lobster?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Mr Mulliner, fixing his honest blue eyes on the speaker,\r\n'he was not. It would be perfectly easy for me to pretend that he was\r\nturned into a lobster; but I have always made it a practice--and I\r\nalways shall make it a practice--to speak nothing but the bare truth.\r\nMy brother Wilfred simply had rather a curious adventure.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy brother Wilfred (said Mr Mulliner) is the clever one of the family.\r\nEven as a boy he was always messing about with chemicals, and at the\r\nUniversity he devoted his time entirely to research. The result was\r\nthat while still quite a young man he had won an established reputation\r\nas the inventor of what are known to the trade as Mulliner's Magic\r\nMarvels--a general term embracing the Raven Gipsy Face-Cream, the Snow\r\nof the Mountains Lotion, and many other preparations, some designed\r\nexclusively for the toilet, others of a curative nature, intended to\r\nalleviate the many ills to which the flesh is heir.\r\n\r\nNaturally, he was a very busy man: and it is to this absorption in his\r\nwork that I attribute the fact that, though--like all the Mulliners--a\r\nman of striking personal charm, he had reached his thirty-first year\r\nwithout ever having been involved in an affair of the heart. I remember\r\nhim telling me once that he simply had no time for girls.\r\n\r\nBut we all fall sooner or later, and these strong concentrated men\r\nharder than any. While taking a brief holiday one year at Cannes, he\r\nmet a Miss Angela Purdue, who was staying at his hotel, and she bowled\r\nhim over completely.\r\n\r\nShe was one of these jolly, outdoor girls; and Wilfred had told me\r\nthat what attracted him first about her was her wholesome sunburned\r\ncomplexion. In fact, he told Miss Purdue the same thing when, shortly\r\nafter he had proposed and been accepted, she asked him in her girlish\r\nway what it was that had first made him begin to love her.\r\n\r\n'It's such a pity,' said Miss Purdue, 'that the sunburn fades so soon.\r\nI do wish I knew some way of keeping it.'\r\n\r\nEven in his moments of holiest emotion Wilfred never forgot that he was\r\na business man.\r\n\r\n'You should try Mulliner's Raven Gipsy Face-Cream,' he said. 'It comes\r\nin two sizes--the small (or half-crown) jar and the large jar at seven\r\nshillings and sixpence. The large jar contains three and a half times\r\nas much as the small jar. It is applied nightly with a small sponge\r\nbefore retiring to rest. Testimonials have been received from numerous\r\nmembers of the aristocracy and may be examined at the office by any\r\nbonafide inquirer.'\r\n\r\n'Is it really good?'\r\n\r\n'I invented it,' said Wilfred, simply.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him adoringly.\r\n\r\n'How clever you are! Any girl ought to be proud to marry you.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well,' said Wilfred, with a modest wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n'All the same, my guardian is going to be terribly angry when I tell\r\nhim we're engaged.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'I inherited the Purdue millions when my uncle died, you see, and my\r\nguardian has always wanted me to marry his son, Percy.'\r\n\r\nWilfred kissed her fondly, and laughed a defiant laugh.\r\n\r\n'Jer mong feesh der selar,' he said lightly.\r\n\r\nBut, some days after his return to London, whither the girl had\r\npreceded him, he had occasion to recall her words. As he sat in his\r\nstudy, musing on a preparation to cure the pip in canaries, a card was\r\nbrought to him.\r\n\r\n'Sir Jasper ffinch-ffarrowmere, Bart.,' he read. The name was strange\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n'Show the gentleman in,' he said. And presently there entered a\r\nvery stout man with a broad, pink face. It was a face whose natural\r\nexpression should, Wilfred felt, have been jovial, but at the moment it\r\nwas grave.\r\n\r\n'Sir Jasper Finch-Farrowmere?' said Wilfred.\r\n\r\n'ffinch-ffarrowmere,' corrected the visitor, his sensitive ear\r\ndetecting the capital letters.\r\n\r\n'Ah yes. You spell it with two small f's.'\r\n\r\n'Four small f's.'\r\n\r\n'And to what do I owe the honour--'\r\n\r\n'I am Angela Purdue's guardian.'\r\n\r\n'How do you do? A whisky-and-soda?'\r\n\r\n'I thank you, no. I am a total abstainer. I found that alcohol had a\r\ntendency to increase my weight, so I gave it up. I have also given\r\nup butter, potatoes, soups of all kinds and--However,' he broke off,\r\nthe fanatic gleam which comes into the eyes of all fat men who are\r\ndescribing their system of diet fading away, 'this is not a social\r\ncall, and I must not take up your time with idle talk. I have a message\r\nfor you, Mr Mulliner. From Angela.'\r\n\r\n'Bless her!' said Wilfred. 'Sir Jasper, I love that girl with a fervour\r\nwhich increases daily.'\r\n\r\n'Is that so?' said the baronet. Well, what I came to say was, it's all\r\noff.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'All off. She sent me to say that she had thought it over and wanted to\r\nbreak the engagement.'\r\n\r\nWilfred's eyes narrowed. He had not forgotten what Angela had said\r\nabout this man wanting her to marry his son. He gazed piercingly at\r\nhis visitor, no longer deceived by the superficial geniality of his\r\nappearance. He had read too many detective stories where the fat,\r\njolly, red-faced man turns out a fiend in human shape to be a ready\r\nvictim to appearances.\r\n\r\n'Indeed?' he said, coldly. 'I should prefer to have this information\r\nfrom Miss Purdue's own lips.'\r\n\r\n'She won't see you. But, anticipating this attitude on your part, I\r\nbrought a letter from her. You recognize the writing?'\r\n\r\nWilfred took the letter. Certainly, the hand was Angela's, and the\r\nmeaning of the words he read unmistakable. Nevertheless, as he handed\r\nthe missive back, there was a hard smile on his face.\r\n\r\n'There is such a thing as writing a letter under compulsion,' he said.\r\n\r\nThe baronet's pink face turned mauve.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean, sir?'\r\n\r\n'What I say.'\r\n\r\n'Are you insinuating--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I am.'\r\n\r\n'Pooh, sir!'\r\n\r\n'Pooh to you!' said Wilfred. 'And, if you want to know what I think,\r\nyou poor fish, I believe your name is spelled with a capital F, like\r\nanybody else's.'\r\n\r\nStung to the quick, the baronet turned on his heel and left the room\r\nwithout another word.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had given up his life to chemical research, Wilfred\r\nMulliner was no mere dreamer. He could be the man of action when\r\nnecessity demanded. Scarcely had his visitor left when he was on his\r\nway to the Senior Test-Tubes, the famous chemists' club in St James's.\r\nThere, consulting Kelly's _County Families_, he learnt that Sir\r\nJasper's address was ffinch Hall in Yorkshire. He had found out all he\r\nwanted to know. It was at ffinch Hall, he decided, that Angela must now\r\nbe immured.\r\n\r\nFor that she was being immured somewhere he had no doubt. That letter,\r\nhe was positive, has been written by her under stress of threats.\r\nThe writing was Angela's, but he declined to believe that she was\r\nresponsible for the phraseology and sentiment. He remembered reading\r\na story where the heroine was forced into courses which she would not\r\notherwise have contemplated by the fact that somebody was standing over\r\nher with a flask of vitriol. Possibly this was what that bounder of a\r\nbaronet had done to Angela.\r\n\r\nConsidering this possibility, he did not blame her for what she had\r\nsaid about him, Wilfred, in the second paragraph of her note. Nor did\r\nhe reproach her for signing herself 'Yrs truly, A. Purdue'. Naturally,\r\nwhen baronets are threatening to pour vitriol down her neck, a refined\r\nand sensitive young girl cannot pick her words. This sort of thing must\r\nof necessity interfere with the selection of the _mot juste_.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, Wilfred was in a train on his way to Yorkshire. That\r\nevening, he was in the ffinch Arms in the village of which Sir Jasper\r\nwas the squire. That night, he was in the gardens of ffinch Hall,\r\nprowling softly round the house, listening.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, as he prowled, there came to his ears from an upper\r\nwindow a sound that made him stiffen like a statue and clench his hands\r\ntill the knuckles stood out white under the strain.\r\n\r\nIt was the sound of a woman sobbing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilfred spent a sleepless night, but by morning he had formed his plan\r\nof action. I will not weary you with a description of the slow and\r\ntedious steps by which he first made the acquaintance of Sir Jasper's\r\nvalet, who was an _habitué_ of the village inn, and then by\r\ncareful stages won the man's confidence with friendly words and beer.\r\nSuffice it to say that, about a week later, Wilfred had induced this\r\nman with bribes to leave suddenly on the plea of an aunt's illness,\r\nsupplying--so as to cause his employer no inconvenience--a cousin to\r\ntake his place.\r\n\r\nThis cousin, as you will have guessed, was Wilfred himself. But a very\r\ndifferent Wilfred from the dark-haired, clean-cut young scientist\r\nwho had revolutionized the world of chemistry a few months before by\r\nproving that H_{2}O+b3g4z7-m9z8=g6f5p3x. Before leaving London on what\r\nhe knew would be a dark and dangerous enterprise, Wilfred had taken\r\nthe precaution of calling in at a well-known costumier's and buying\r\na red wig. He had also purchased a pair of blue spectacles: but for\r\nthe role which he had now undertaken these were, of course, useless.\r\nA blue-spectacled valet could not but have aroused suspicion in the\r\nmost guileless baronet. All that Wilfred did, therefore, in the way of\r\npreparation, was to don the wig, shave off his moustache, and treat his\r\nface to a light coating of the Raven Gipsy Face-Cream. This done, he\r\nset out for ffinch Hall.\r\n\r\nExternally, ffinch Hall was one of those gloomy, sombre country-houses\r\nwhich seem to exist only for the purpose of having horrid crimes\r\ncommitted in them. Even in his brief visit to the grounds, Wilfred had\r\nnoticed fully half a dozen places which seemed incomplete without a\r\ncross indicating spot where body was found by the police. It was the\r\nsort of house where ravens croak in the front garden just before the\r\ndeath of the heir, and shrieks ring out from behind barred windows in\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nNor was its interior more cheerful. And, as for the personnel of\r\nthe domestic staff, that was less exhilarating than anything else\r\nabout the place. It consisted of an aged cook who, as she bent over\r\nher cauldrons, looked like something out of a travelling company of\r\n_Macbeth_, touring the smaller towns of the North, and Murgatroyd,\r\nthe butler, a huge, sinister man with a cast in one eye and an evil\r\nlight in the other.\r\n\r\nMany men, under these conditions, would have been daunted. But not\r\nWilfred Mulliner. Apart from the fact that, like all the Mulliners, he\r\nwas as brave as a lion, he had come expecting something of this nature.\r\nHe settled down to his duties and kept his eyes open, and before long\r\nhis vigilance was rewarded.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he lurked about the dim-lit passage-ways, he saw Sir Jasper\r\ncoming up the stairs with a laden tray in his hands. It contained a\r\ntoast-rack, a half bot. of white wine, pepper, salt, veg., and in a\r\ncovered dish something which Wilfred, sniffing cautiously, decided was\r\na cutlet.\r\n\r\nLurking in the shadows, he followed the baronet to the top of the\r\nhouse. Sir Jasper paused at a door on the second floor. He knocked. The\r\ndoor opened, a hand was stretched forth, the tray vanished, the door\r\nclosed, and the baronet moved away.\r\n\r\nSo did Wilfred. He had seen what he had wanted to see, discovered what\r\nhe had wanted to discover. He returned to the servants' hall, and under\r\nthe gloomy eyes of Murgatroyd began to shape his plans.\r\n\r\n'Where you been?' demanded the butler, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n'Oh, hither and thither,' said Wilfred, with a well-assumed airiness.\r\n\r\nMurgatroyd directed a menacing glance at him.\r\n\r\n'You'd better stay where you belong,' he said, in his thick, growling\r\nvoice. 'There's things in this house that don't want seeing.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' agreed the cook, dropping an onion in the cauldron.\r\n\r\nWilfred could not repress a shudder.\r\n\r\nBut, even as he shuddered, he was conscious of a certain relief.\r\nAt least, he reflected, they were not starving his darling. That\r\ncutlet had smelt uncommonly good: and, if the bill of fare was always\r\nmaintained at this level, she had nothing to complain of in the\r\ncatering.\r\n\r\nBut his relief was short-lived. What, after all, he asked himself, are\r\ncutlets to a girl who is imprisoned in a locked room of a sinister\r\ncountry-house and is being forced to marry a man she does not love?\r\nPractically nothing. When the heart is sick, cutlets merely alleviate,\r\nthey do not cure. Fiercely Wilfred told himself that, come what might,\r\nfew days should pass before he found the key to that locked door and\r\nbore away his love to freedom and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe only obstacle in the way of this scheme was that it was plainly\r\ngoing to be a matter of the greatest difficulty to find the key. That\r\nnight, when his employer dined, Wilfred searched his room thoroughly.\r\nHe found nothing. The key, he was forced to conclude, was kept on the\r\nbaronet's person.\r\n\r\nThen how to secure it?\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that Wilfred Mulliner was nonplussed. The\r\nbrain which had electrified the world of Science by discovering that\r\nif you mixed a stiffish oxygen and potassium and added a splash of\r\ntrinitrotoluol and a spot of old brandy you got something that could be\r\nsold in America as champagne at a hundred and fifty dollars the case\r\nhad to confess itself baffled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo attempt to analyse the young man's emotions, as the next week\r\ndragged itself by, would be merely morbid. Life cannot, of course,\r\nbe all sunshine: and in relating a story like this, which is a\r\nslice of life, one must pay as much attention to shade as to light:\r\nnevertheless, it would be tedious were I to describe to you in detail\r\nthe soul-torments which afflicted Wilfred Mulliner as day followed\r\nday and no solution to the problem presented itself. You are all\r\nintelligent men, and you can picture to yourselves how a high-spirited\r\nyoung fellow, deeply in love, must have felt; knowing that the girl he\r\nloved was languishing in what practically amounted to a dungeon, though\r\nsituated on an upper floor, and chafing at his inability to set her\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nHis eyes became sunken. His cheek-bones stood out. He lost weight.\r\nAnd so noticeable was this change in his physique that Sir Jasper\r\nffinch-ffarrowmere commented on it one evening in tones of unconcealed\r\nenvy.\r\n\r\n'How the devil, Straker,' he said--for this was the pseudonym under\r\nwhich Wilfred was passing--'do you manage to keep so thin? Judging by\r\nthe weekly books, you eat like a starving Esquimaux, and yet you don't\r\nput on weight. Now I, in addition to knocking off butter and potatoes,\r\nhave started drinking hot unsweetened lemon-juice each night before\r\nretiring: and yet, damme,' he said--for, like all baronets, he was\r\ncareless in his language--'I weighed myself this morning, and I was up\r\nanother six ounces. What's the explanation?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Sir Jasper,' said Wilfred, mechanically.\r\n\r\n'What the devil do you mean, Yes, Sir Jasper?'\r\n\r\n'No, Sir Jasper.'\r\n\r\nThe baronet wheezed plaintively.\r\n\r\n'I've been studying this matter closely,' he said, 'and it's one of\r\nthe seven wonders of the world. Have you ever seen a fat valet? Of\r\ncourse not. Nor has anybody else. There is no such thing as a fat\r\nvalet. And yet there is scarcely a moment during the day when a valet\r\nis not eating. He rises at six-thirty, and at seven is having coffee\r\nand buttered toast. At eight, he breakfasts off porridge, cream, eggs,\r\nbacon, jam, bread, butter, more eggs, more bacon, more jam, more tea,\r\nand more butter, finishing up with a slice of cold ham and a sardine.\r\nAt eleven o'clock he has his \"elevenses\", consisting of coffee, cream,\r\nmore bread, and more butter. At one, luncheon--a hearty meal, replete\r\nwith every form of starchy food and lots of beer. If he can get at\r\nthe port, he has port. At three, a snack. At four, another snack. At\r\nfive, tea and buttered toast. At seven--dinner, probably with floury\r\npotatoes, and certainly with lots more beer. At nine, another snack.\r\nAnd at ten-thirty he retires to bed, taking with him a glass of milk\r\nand a plate of biscuits to keep himself from getting hungry in the\r\nnight. And yet he remains as slender as a string-bean, while I, who\r\nhave been dieting for years, tip the beam at two hundred and seventeen\r\npounds, and am growing a third and supplementary chin. These are\r\nmysteries, Straker.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Sir Jasper.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll tell you one thing,' said the baronet, 'I'm getting down\r\none of those indoor Turkish Bath cabinet-affairs from London; and if\r\nthat doesn't do the trick, I give up the struggle.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe indoor Turkish Bath duly arrived and was unpacked; and it was some\r\nthree nights later that Wilfred, brooding in the servants' hall, was\r\naroused from his reverie by Murgatroyd.\r\n\r\n'Here,' said Murgatroyd, 'wake up. Sir Jasper's calling you.'\r\n\r\n'Calling me what?' asked Wilfred, coming to himself with a start.\r\n\r\n'Calling you very loud,' growled the butler.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed so. From the upper regions of the house there was\r\nproceeding a series of sharp yelps, evidently those of a man in mortal\r\nstress. Wilfred was reluctant to interfere in any way if, as seemed\r\nprobable, his employer was dying in agony; but he was a conscientious\r\nman, and it was his duty, while in this sinister house, to perform the\r\nwork for which he was paid. He hurried up the stairs; and, entering Sir\r\nJasper's bedroom, perceived the baronet's crimson face protruding from\r\nthe top of the indoor Turkish Bath.\r\n\r\n'So you've come at last!' cried Sir Jasper. 'Look here, when you put me\r\ninto this infernal contrivance just now, what did you do to the dashed\r\nthing?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing beyond what was indicated in the printed pamphlet accompanying\r\nthe machine, Sir Jasper. Following the instructions, I slid Rod A into\r\nGroove B, fastening with Catch C--'\r\n\r\n'Well, you must have made a mess of it, somehow. The thing's stuck. I\r\ncan't get out.'\r\n\r\n'You can't?' cried Wilfred.\r\n\r\n'No. And the bally apparatus is getting considerably hotter than the\r\nhinges of the Inferno.' I must apologize for Sir Jasper's language, but\r\nyou know what baronets are. 'I'm being cooked to a crisp.'\r\n\r\nA sudden flash of light seemed to blaze upon Wilfred Mulliner.\r\n\r\n'I will release you, Sir Jasper--'\r\n\r\n'Well, hurry up, then.'\r\n\r\n'On one condition.' Wilfred fixed him with a piercing gaze. 'First, I\r\nmust have the key.'\r\n\r\n'There isn't a key, you idiot. It doesn't lock. It just clicks when you\r\nslide Gadget D into Thingummybob E.'\r\n\r\n'The key I require is that of the room in which you are holding Angela\r\nPurdue a prisoner.'\r\n\r\n'What the devil do you mean? Ouch!'\r\n\r\n'I will tell you what I mean, Sir Jasper ffinch-ffarrowmere. I am\r\nWilfred Mulliner!'\r\n\r\n'Don't be an ass. Wilfred Mulliner has black hair. Yours is red. You\r\nmust be thinking of someone else.'\r\n\r\n'This is a wig,' said Wilfred. 'By Clarkson.' He shook a\r\nmenacing finger at the baronet. 'You little thought, Sir Jasper\r\nffinch-ffarrowmere, when you embarked on this dastardly scheme, that\r\nWilfred Mulliner was watching your every move. I guessed your plans\r\nfrom the start. And now is the moment when I checkmate them. Give me\r\nthat key, you Fiend.'\r\n\r\n'ffiend,' corrected Sir Jasper, automatically.\r\n\r\n'I am going to release my darling, to take her away from this dreadful\r\nhouse, to marry her by special licence as soon as it can legally be\r\ndone.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of his sufferings, a ghastly laugh escaped Sir Jasper's lips.\r\n\r\n'You are, are you?'\r\n\r\n'I am.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you are!'\r\n\r\n'Give me the key.'\r\n\r\n'I haven't got it, you chump. It's in the door.'\r\n\r\n'Ha, ha!'\r\n\r\n'It's no good saying \"Ha, ha!\" It is in the door. On Angela's side of\r\nthe door.'\r\n\r\n'A likely story! But I cannot stay here wasting time. If you will not\r\ngive me the key, I shall go up and break in the door.'\r\n\r\n'Do!' Once more the baronet laughed like a tortured soul. 'And see what\r\nshe'll say.'\r\n\r\nWilfred could make nothing of this last remark. He could, he thought,\r\nimagine very clearly what Angela would say. He could picture her\r\nsobbing on his chest, murmuring that she knew he would come, that she\r\nhad never doubted him for an instant. He leapt for the door.\r\n\r\n'Here! Hi! Aren't you going to let me out?'\r\n\r\n'Presently,' said Wilfred. 'Keep cool.' He raced up the stairs.\r\n\r\n'Angela,' he cried, pressing his lips against the panel. 'Angela!'\r\n\r\n'Who's that?' answered a well-remembered voice from within.\r\n\r\n'It is I--Wilfred. I am going to burst open the door. Stand clear of\r\nthe gates.'\r\n\r\nHe drew back a few paces, and hurled himself at the woodwork. There was\r\na grinding crash, as the lock gave. And Wilfred, staggering on, found\r\nhimself in a room so dark that he could see nothing.\r\n\r\n'Angela, where are you?'\r\n\r\n'I'm here. And I'd like to know why you are, after that letter I wrote\r\nyou. Some men,' continued the strangely cold voice, 'do not seem to\r\nknow how to take a hint.'\r\n\r\nWilfred staggered, and would have fallen had he not clutched at his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n'That letter?' he stammered. 'You surely didn't mean what you wrote in\r\nthat letter?'\r\n\r\n'I meant every word and I wish I had put in more.'\r\n\r\n'But--but--but--But don't you love me, Angela?'\r\n\r\nA hard, mocking laugh rang through the room.\r\n\r\n'Love you? Love the man who recommended me to try Mulliner's Raven\r\nGipsy Face-Cream!'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I will tell you what I mean. Wilfred Mulliner, look on your handiwork!'\r\n\r\nThe room became suddenly flooded with light. And there, standing with\r\nher hand on the switch, stood Angela--a queenly, lovely figure, in\r\nwhose radiant beauty the sternest critic would have noted but one\r\nflaw--the fact that she was piebald.\r\n\r\nWilfred gazed at her with adoring eyes. Her face was partly brown and\r\npartly white, and on her snowy neck were patches of sepia that looked\r\nlike the thumb-prints you find on the pages of books in the Free\r\nLibrary: but he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever\r\nseen. He longed to fold her in his arms: and but for the fact that her\r\neyes told him that she would undoubtedly land an upper-cut on him if he\r\ntried it he would have done so.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she went on, 'this is what you have made of me, Wilfred\r\nMulliner--you and that awful stuff you call the Raven Gipsy Face-Cream.\r\nThis is the skin you loved to touch! I took your advice and bought\r\none of the large jars at seven and six, and see the result! Barely\r\ntwenty-four hours after the first application, I could have walked into\r\nany circus and named my own terms as the Spotted Princess of the Fiji\r\nIslands. I fled here to my childhood home, to hide myself. And the\r\nfirst thing that happened'--her voice broke--'was that my favourite\r\nhunter shied at me and tried to bite pieces out of his manger: while\r\nPonto, my little dog, whom I have reared from a puppy, caught one sight\r\nof my face and is now in the hands of the vet. and unlikely to recover.\r\nAnd it was you, Wilfred Mulliner, who brought this curse upon me!'\r\n\r\nMany men would have wilted beneath these searing words, but Wilfred\r\nMulliner merely smiled with infinite compassion and understanding.\r\n\r\n'It is quite all right,' he said. 'I should have warned you,\r\nsweetheart, that this occasionally happens in cases where the skin is\r\nexceptionally delicate and finely-textured. It can be speedily remedied\r\nby an application of the Mulliner Snow of the Mountains Lotion, four\r\nshillings the medium-sized bottle.'\r\n\r\n'Wilfred! Is this true?'\r\n\r\n'Perfectly true, dearest. And is this all that stands between us?'\r\n\r\n'No!' shouted a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\nWilfred wheeled sharply. In the doorway stood Sir Jasper\r\nffinch-ffarrowmere. He was swathed in a bath-towel, what was visible\r\nof his person being a bright crimson. Behind him, toying with a\r\nhorse-whip, stood Murgatroyd, the butler.\r\n\r\n'You didn't expect to see me, did you?'\r\n\r\n'I certainly,' replied Wilfred, severely, 'did not expect to see you in\r\na lady's presence in a costume like that.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind my costume.' Sir Jasper turned.\r\n\r\n'Murgatroyd, do your duty!'\r\n\r\nThe butler, scowling horribly, advanced into the room.\r\n\r\n'Stop!' screamed Angela.\r\n\r\n'I haven't begun yet, miss,' said the butler, deferentially.\r\n\r\n'You shan't touch Wilfred. I love him.'\r\n\r\n'What!' cried Sir Jasper. 'After all that has happened?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. He has explained everything.'\r\n\r\nA grim frown appeared on the baronet's vermilion face.\r\n\r\n'I'll bet he hasn't explained why he left me to be cooked in that\r\ninfernal Turkish Bath. I was beginning to throw out clouds of smoke\r\nwhen Murgatroyd, faithful fellow, heard my cries and came and released\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'Though not my work,' added the butler.\r\n\r\nWilfred eyed him steadily.\r\n\r\n'If,' he said, 'you used Mulliner's Reduc-o, the recognized specific\r\nfor obesity, whether in the tabloid form at three shillings the tin,\r\nor as a liquid at five and six the flask, you would have no need\r\nto stew in Turkish Baths. Mulliner's Reduc-o, which contains no\r\ninjurious chemicals, but is compounded purely of health-giving herbs,\r\nis guaranteed to remove excess weight, steadily and without weakening\r\nafter-effects, at the rate of two pounds a week. As used by the\r\nnobility.'\r\n\r\nThe glare of hatred faded from the baronet's eyes.\r\n\r\n'Is that a fact?' he whispered.\r\n\r\n'It is.'\r\n\r\n'You guarantee it?'\r\n\r\n'All the Mulliner preparations are fully guaranteed.'\r\n\r\n'My boy!' cried the baronet. He shook Wilfred by the hand. 'Take her,'\r\nhe said, brokenly. 'And with her my b-blessing.'\r\n\r\nA discreet cough sounded in the background.\r\n\r\n'You haven't anything, by any chance, sir,' asked Murgatroyd, 'that's\r\ngood for lumbago?'\r\n\r\n'Mulliner's Ease-o will cure the most stubborn case in six days.'\r\n\r\n'Bless you, sir, bless you,' sobbed Murgatroyd. 'Where can I get it?'\r\n\r\n'At all chemists.'\r\n\r\n'It catches me in the small of the back principally, sir.'\r\n\r\n'It need catch you no longer,' said Wilfred.\r\n\r\nThere is little to add. Murgatroyd is now the most lissom butler in\r\nYorkshire. Sir Jasper's weight is down under the fifteen stone and he\r\nis thinking of taking up hunting again. Wilfred and Angela are man and\r\nwife; and never, I am informed, had the wedding-bells of the old church\r\nat ffinch village rung out a blither peal than they did on that June\r\nmorning when Angela, raising to her love a face on which the brown was\r\nas evenly distributed as on an antique walnut table, replied to the\r\nclergyman's question, 'Wilt thou, Angela, take this Wilfred?' with a\r\nshy, 'I will'. They now have two bonny bairns--the small, or Percival,\r\nat a preparatory school in Sussex, and the large, or Ferdinand, at Eton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere Mr Mulliner, having finished his hot Scotch, bade us farewell and\r\ntook his departure.\r\n\r\nA silence followed his exit. The company seemed plunged in deep\r\nthought. Then somebody rose.\r\n\r\n'Well, good night all,' he said.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to sum up the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\n                        MULLINER'S BUCK-U-UPPO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village Choral Society had been giving a performance of Gilbert and\r\nSullivan's _Sorcerer_ in aid of the Church Organ Fund; and, as we\r\nsat in the window of the Anglers' Rest, smoking our pipes, the audience\r\ncame streaming past us down the little street. Snatches of song floated\r\nto our ears, and Mr Mulliner began to croon in unison.\r\n\r\n'\"Ah me! I was a pa-ale you-oung curate then!\"' chanted Mr Mulliner in\r\nthe rather snuffling voice in which the amateur singer seems to find it\r\nnecessary to render the old songs.\r\n\r\n'Remarkable,' he said, resuming his natural tones, 'how fashions\r\nchange, even in clergymen. There are very few pale young curates\r\nnowadays.'\r\n\r\n'True,' I agreed. 'Most of them are beefy young fellows who rowed for\r\ntheir colleges. I don't believe I have ever seen a pale young curate.'\r\n\r\n'You never met my nephew Augustine, I think?'\r\n\r\n'Never.'\r\n\r\n'The description in the song would have fitted him perfectly. You will\r\nwant to hear all about my nephew Augustine.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I am speaking (said Mr Mulliner) my nephew\r\nAugustine was a curate, and very young and extremely pale. As a boy\r\nhe had completely outgrown his strength, and I rather think at his\r\nTheological College some of the wilder spirits must have bullied him;\r\nfor when he went to Lower Briskett-in-the-Midden to assist the vicar,\r\nthe Rev. Stanley Brandon, in his cure of souls, he was as meek and\r\nmild a young man as you could meet in a day's journey. He had flaxen\r\nhair, weak blue eyes, and the general demeanour of a saintly but timid\r\ncod-fish. Precisely, in short, the sort of young curate who seems to\r\nhave been so common in the eighties, or whenever it was that Gilbert\r\nwrote _The Sorcerer_.\r\n\r\nThe personality of his immediate superior did little or nothing to help\r\nhim to overcome his native diffidence. The Rev. Stanley Brandon was a\r\nhuge and sinewy man of violent temper, whose red face and glittering\r\neyes might well have intimidated the toughest curate. The Rev. Stanley\r\nhad been a heavy-weight boxer at Cambridge, and I gather from Augustine\r\nthat he seemed to be always on the point of introducing into debates\r\non parish matters the methods which had made him so successful in the\r\nroped ring. I remember Augustine telling me that once, on the occasion\r\nwhen he had ventured to oppose the other's views in the matter of\r\ndecorating the church for the Harvest Festival, he thought for a moment\r\nthat the vicar was going to drop him with a right hook to the chin.\r\nIt was some quite trivial point that had come up--a question as to\r\nwhether the pumpkin would look better in the apse or the clerestory, if\r\nI recollect rightly--but for several seconds it seemed as if blood was\r\nabout to be shed.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Rev. Stanley Brandon. And yet it was to the daughter of\r\nthis formidable man that Augustine Mulliner had permitted himself to\r\nlose his heart. Truly, Cupid makes heroes of us all.\r\n\r\nJane was a very nice girl, and just as fond of Augustine as he was\r\nof her. But, as each lacked the nerve to go to the girl's father\r\nand put him abreast of the position of affairs, they were forced to\r\nmeet surreptitiously. This jarred upon Augustine, who, like all the\r\nMulliners, loved the truth and hated any form of deception. And one\r\nevening, as they paced beside the laurels at the bottom of the vicarage\r\ngarden, he rebelled.\r\n\r\n'My dearest,' said Augustine, 'I can no longer brook this secrecy. I\r\nshall go into the house immediately and ask your father for your hand.'\r\n\r\nJane paled and clung to his arm. She knew so well that it was not her\r\nhand but her father's foot which he would receive if he carried out\r\nthis mad scheme.\r\n\r\n'No, no, Augustine! You must not!'\r\n\r\n'But, darling, it is the only straightforward course.'\r\n\r\n'But not tonight. I beg of you, not tonight.'\r\n\r\n'Why not?'\r\n\r\n'Because father is in a very bad temper. He has just had a letter from\r\nthe bishop, rebuking him for wearing too many orphreys on his chasuble,\r\nand it has upset him terribly. You see, he and the bishop were at\r\nschool together, and father can never forget it. He said at dinner that\r\nif old Boko Bickerton thought he was going to order him about he would\r\njolly well show him.'\r\n\r\n'And the bishop comes here tomorrow for the Confirmation services!'\r\ngasped Augustine.\r\n\r\n'Yes. And I'm so afraid they will quarrel. It's such a pity father\r\nhasn't some other bishop over him. He always remembers that he once hit\r\nthis one in the eye for pouring ink on his collar, and this lowers his\r\nrespect for his spiritual authority. So you won't go in and tell him\r\ntonight, will you?'\r\n\r\n'I will not,' Augustine assured her with a slight shiver.\r\n\r\n'And you will be sure to put your feet in hot mustard and water when\r\nyou get home? The dew has made the grass so wet.'\r\n\r\n'I will indeed, dearest.'\r\n\r\n'You are not strong, you know.'\r\n\r\n'No, I am not strong.'\r\n\r\n'You ought to take some really good tonic.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps I ought. Good night, Jane.'\r\n\r\n'Good night, Augustine.'\r\n\r\nThe lovers parted. Jane slipped back into the vicarage, and Augustine\r\nmade his way to his cosy rooms in the High Street. And the first thing\r\nhe noticed on entering was a parcel on the table, and beside it a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nHe opened it listlessly, his thoughts far away.\r\n\r\n'My dear Augustine.'\r\n\r\nHe turned to the last page and glanced at the signature. The letter was\r\nfrom his Aunt Angela, the wife of my brother, Wilfred Mulliner. You may\r\nremember that I once told you the story of how these two came together.\r\nIf so, you will recall that my brother Wilfred was the eminent chemical\r\nresearcher who had invented, among other specifics, such world-famous\r\npreparations as Mulliner's Raven Gipsy Face-Cream and the Mulliner Snow\r\nof the Mountains Lotion. He and Augustine had never been particularly\r\nintimate, but between Augustine and his aunt there had always existed a\r\nwarm friendship.\r\n\r\n    My dear Augustine (wrote Angela Mulliner),\r\n\r\n    I have been thinking so much about you lately, and I cannot forget\r\n    that, when I saw you last, you seemed very fragile and deficient in\r\n    vitamins. I do hope you take care of yourself.\r\n\r\n    I have been feeling for some time that you ought to take a tonic,\r\n    and by a lucky chance Wilfred has just invented one which he tells\r\n    me is the finest thing he has ever done. It is called Buck-U-Uppo,\r\n    and acts directly on the red corpuscles. It is not yet on the\r\n    market, but I have managed to smuggle a sample bottle from\r\n    Wilfred's laboratory, and I want you to try it at once. I am sure\r\n    it is just what you need.\r\n\r\n                                                Your affectionate aunt,\r\n                                                        Angela Mulliner\r\n\r\n    PS.--You take a tablespoonful before going to bed, and another just\r\n    before breakfast.\r\n\r\nAugustine was not an unduly superstitious young man, but the\r\ncoincidence of this tonic arriving so soon after Jane had told him that\r\na tonic was what he needed affected him deeply. It seemed to him that\r\nthis thing must have been meant. He shook the bottle, uncorked it, and,\r\npouring out a liberal tablespoonful, shut his eyes and swallowed it.\r\n\r\nThe medicine, he was glad to find, was not unpleasant to the taste.\r\nIt had a slightly pungent flavour, rather like old boot-soles beaten\r\nup in sherry. Having taken the dose, he read for a while in a book of\r\ntheological essays, and then went to bed.\r\n\r\nAnd as his feet slipped between the sheets, he was annoyed to find that\r\nMrs Wardle, his housekeeper, had once more forgotten his hot-water\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n'Oh, dash!' said Augustine.\r\n\r\nHe was thoroughly upset. He had told the woman over and over again that\r\nhe suffered from cold feet and could not get to sleep unless the dogs\r\nwere properly warmed up. He sprang out of bed and went to the head of\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n'Mrs Wardle!' he cried.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\n'Mrs Wardle!' bellowed Augustine in a voice that rattled the\r\nwindow-panes like a strong nor'-easter. Until tonight he had always\r\nbeen very much afraid of his housekeeper and had both walked and talked\r\nsoftly in her presence. But now he was conscious of a strange new\r\nfortitude. His head was singing a little, and he felt equal to a dozen\r\nMrs Wardles.\r\n\r\nShuffling footsteps made themselves heard.\r\n\r\n'Well, what is it now?' asked a querulous voice.\r\n\r\nAugustine snorted.\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you what it is now,' he roared. 'How many times have I told\r\nyou always to put a hot-water bottle in my bed? You've forgotten it\r\nagain, you old cloth-head!'\r\n\r\nMrs Wardle peered up, astounded and militant.\r\n\r\n'Mr Mulliner, I am not accustomed--'\r\n\r\n'Shut up!' thundered Augustine. 'What I want from you is less back-chat\r\nand more hot-water bottles. Bring it up at once, or I leave tomorrow.\r\nLet me endeavour to get it into your concrete skull that you aren't\r\nthe only person letting rooms in this village. Any more lip and I walk\r\nstraight round the corner, where I'll be appreciated. Hot-water bottle\r\nho! And look slippy about it.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Mr Mulliner. Certainly, Mr Mulliner. In one moment, Mr Mulliner.'\r\n\r\n'Action! Action!' boomed Augustine. 'Show some speed. Put a little snap\r\ninto it.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, most decidedly, Mr Mulliner,' replied the chastened voice\r\nfrom below.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, as he was dropping off to sleep, a thought crept into\r\nAugustine's mind. Had he not been a little brusque with Mrs Wardle? Had\r\nthere not been in his manner something a shade abrupt--almost rude?\r\nYes, he decided regretfully, there had. He lit a candle and reached for\r\nthe diary which lay on the table at his bedside.\r\n\r\nHe made an entry.\r\n\r\n    The meek shall inherit the earth. Am I sufficiently meek? I wonder.\r\n    This evening, when reproaching Mrs Wardle, my worthy housekeeper,\r\n    for omitting to place a hot-water bottle in my bed, I spoke quite\r\n    crossly. The provocation was severe, but still I was surely to\r\n    blame for allowing my passions to run riot. Mem: Must guard agst\r\n    this.\r\n\r\nBut when he woke next morning, different feelings prevailed. He took\r\nhis ante-breakfast dose of Buck-U-Uppo: and looking at the entry in\r\nthe diary, could scarcely believe that it was he who had written it.\r\n'Quite cross?' Of course he had been quite cross. Wouldn't anybody be\r\nquite cross who was for ever being persecuted by beetle-wits who forgot\r\nhot-water bottles?\r\n\r\nErasing the words with one strong dash of a thick-leaded pencil, he\r\nscribbled in the margin a hasty 'Mashed potatoes! Served the old idiot\r\nright!' and went down to breakfast.\r\n\r\nHe felt most amazingly fit. Undoubtedly, in asserting that this tonic\r\nof his acted forcefully upon the red corpuscles, his Uncle Wilfred had\r\nbeen right. Until that moment Augustine had never supposed that he had\r\nany red corpuscles; but now, as he sat waiting for Mrs Wardle to bring\r\nhim his fried egg, he could feel them dancing about all over him. They\r\nseemed to be forming rowdy parties and sliding down his spine. His eyes\r\nsparkled, and from sheer joy of living he sang a few bars from the hymn\r\nfor those of riper years at sea.\r\n\r\nHe was still singing when Mrs Wardle entered with a dish.\r\n\r\n'What's this?' demanded Augustine, eyeing it dangerously.\r\n\r\n'A nice fried egg, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And what, pray, do you mean by nice? It may be an amiable egg. It may\r\nbe a civil, well-meaning egg. But if you think it is fit for human\r\nconsumption, adjust that impression. Go back to your kitchen, woman;\r\nselect another; and remember this time that you are a cook, not an\r\nincinerating machine. Between an egg that is fried and an egg that is\r\ncremated there is a wide and substantial difference. This difference,\r\nif you wish to retain me as a lodger in these far too expensive rooms,\r\nyou will endeavour to appreciate.'\r\n\r\nThe glowing sense of well-being with which Augustine had begun the\r\nday did not diminish with the passage of time. It seemed, indeed, to\r\nincrease. So full of effervescing energy did the young man feel that,\r\ndeparting from his usual custom of spending the morning crouched over\r\nthe fire, he picked up his hat, stuck it at a rakish angle on his head,\r\nand sallied out for a healthy tramp across the fields.\r\n\r\nIt was while he was returning, flushed and rosy, that he observed\r\na sight which is rare in the country districts of England--the\r\nspectacle of a bishop running. It is not often in a place like Lower\r\nBriskett-in-the-Midden that you see a bishop at all; and when you do he\r\nis either riding in a stately car or pacing at a dignified walk. This\r\none was sprinting like a Derby winner, and Augustine paused to drink in\r\nthe sight.\r\n\r\nThe bishop was a large, burly bishop, built for endurance rather than\r\nspeed; but he was making excellent going. He flashed past Augustine in\r\na whirl of flying gaiters: and then, proving himself thereby no mere\r\nspecialist but a versatile all-round athlete, suddenly dived for a tree\r\nand climbed rapidly into its branches. His motive, Augustine readily\r\ndivined, was to elude a rough, hairy dog which was toiling in his wake.\r\nThe dog reached the tree a moment after his quarry had climbed it, and\r\nstood there, barking.\r\n\r\nAugustine strolled up.\r\n\r\n'Having a little trouble with the dumb friend, bish?' he asked,\r\ngenially.\r\n\r\nThe bishop peered down from his eyrie.\r\n\r\n'Young man,' he said, 'save me!'\r\n\r\n'Right most indubitably ho!' replied Augustine. 'Leave it to me.'\r\n\r\nUntil today he had always been terrified of dogs, but now he did not\r\nhesitate. Almost quicker than words can tell, he picked up a stone,\r\ndischarged it at the animal, and whooped cheerily as it got home with\r\na thud. The dog, knowing when he had had enough, removed himself at\r\nsome forty-five m.p.h.; and the bishop, descending cautiously, clasped\r\nAugustine's hand in his.\r\n\r\n'My preserver!' said the bishop.\r\n\r\n'Don't give it another thought,' said Augustine, cheerily. 'Always glad\r\nto do a pal a good turn. We clergymen must stick together.'\r\n\r\n'I thought he had me for a minute.'\r\n\r\n'Quite a nasty customer. Full of rude energy.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop nodded.\r\n\r\n'His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. Deuteronomy xxxiv,\r\n7,' he agreed. 'I wonder if you can direct me to the vicarage? I fear I\r\nhave come a little out of my way.'\r\n\r\n'I'll take you there.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you. Perhaps it would be as well if you did not come in. I have\r\na serious matter to discuss with old Pieface--I mean, with the Rev.\r\nStanley Brandon.'\r\n\r\n'I have a serious matter to discuss with his daughter. I'll just hang\r\nabout the garden.'\r\n\r\n'You are a very excellent young man,' said the bishop, as they walked\r\nalong. 'You are a curate, eh?'\r\n\r\n'At present. But,' said Augustine, tapping his companion on the chest,\r\n'just watch my smoke. That's all I ask you to do--just watch my smoke.'\r\n\r\n'I will. You should rise to great heights--to the very top of the tree.'\r\n\r\n'Like you did just now, eh? Ha, ha!'\r\n\r\n'Ha, ha!' said the bishop. 'You young rogue!'\r\n\r\nHe poked Augustine in the ribs.\r\n\r\n'Ha, ha, ha!' said Augustine.\r\n\r\nHe slapped the bishop on the back.\r\n\r\n'But all joking aside,' said the bishop as they entered the vicarage\r\ngrounds, 'I really shall keep my eye on you and see that you receive\r\nthe swift preferment which your talents and character deserve. I say to\r\nyou, my dear young friend, speaking seriously and weighing my words,\r\nthat the way you picked that dog off with that stone was the smoothest\r\nthing I ever saw. And I am a man who always tells the strict truth.'\r\n\r\n'Great is truth and mighty above all things. Esdras iv, 41,' said\r\nAugustine.\r\n\r\nHe turned away and strolled towards the laurel bushes, which were his\r\ncustomary meeting-place with Jane. The bishop went on to the front door\r\nand rang the bell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough they had made no definite appointment, Augustine was surprised\r\nwhen the minutes passed and no Jane appeared. He did not know that she\r\nhad been told off by her father to entertain the bishop's wife that\r\nmorning, and show her the sights of Lower Briskett-in-the-Midden. He\r\nwaited some quarter of an hour with growing impatience, and was about\r\nto leave when suddenly from the house there came to his ears the sound\r\nof voices raised angrily.\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The voices appeared to proceed from a room on the ground\r\nfloor facing the garden.\r\n\r\nRunning lightly over the turf, Augustine paused outside the window and\r\nlistened. The window was open at the bottom, and he could hear quite\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\nThe vicar was speaking in a voice that vibrated through the room.\r\n\r\n'Is that so?' said the vicar.\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is!' said the bishop.\r\n\r\n'Ha, ha!'\r\n\r\n'Ha, ha! to you, and see how you like it!' rejoined the bishop with\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nAugustine drew a step closer. It was plain that Jane's fears had been\r\njustified and that there was serious trouble afoot between these two\r\nold schoolfellows. He peeped in. The vicar, his hands behind his\r\ncoat-tails, was striding up and down the carpet, while the bishop, his\r\nback to the fireplace, glared defiance at him from the hearth-rug.\r\n\r\n'Who ever told you you were an authority on chasubles?' demanded the\r\nvicar.\r\n\r\n'That's all right who told me,' rejoined the bishop.\r\n\r\n'I don't believe you know what a chasuble is.'\r\n\r\n'Is that so?'\r\n\r\n'Well, what is it, then?'\r\n\r\n'It's a circular cloak hanging from the shoulders, elaborately\r\nembroidered with a pattern and with orphreys. And you can argue as much\r\nas you like, young Pieface, but you can't get away from the fact that\r\nthere are too many orphreys on yours. And what I'm telling you is that\r\nyou've jolly well got to switch off a few of these orphreys or you'll\r\nget it in the neck.'\r\n\r\nThe vicar's eyes glittered furiously.\r\n\r\n'Is that so?' he said. 'Well, I just won't, so there! And it's like\r\nyour cheek coming here and trying to high-hat me. You seem to have\r\nforgotten that I knew you when you were an inky-faced kid at school,\r\nand that, if I liked, I could tell the world one or two things about\r\nyou which would probably amuse it.'\r\n\r\n'My past is an open book.'\r\n\r\n'Is it?' The vicar laughed malevolently. 'Who put the white mouse in\r\nthe French master's desk?'\r\n\r\nThe bishop started.\r\n\r\n'Who put jam in the dormitory prefect's bed?' he retorted.\r\n\r\n'Who couldn't keep his collar clean?'\r\n\r\n'Who used to wear a dickey?' The bishop's wonderful organ-like voice,\r\nwhose softest whisper could be heard throughout a vast cathedral, rang\r\nout in tone of thunder. 'Who was sick at the house supper?'\r\n\r\nThe vicar quivered from head to foot. His rubicund face turned a deeper\r\ncrimson.\r\n\r\n'You know jolly well,' he said, in shaking accents, 'that there was\r\nsomething wrong with the turkey. Might have upset anyone.'\r\n\r\n'The only thing wrong with the turkey was that you ate too much of it.\r\nIf you had paid as much attention to developing your soul as you did to\r\ndeveloping your tummy, you might by now,' said the bishop, 'have risen\r\nto my own eminence.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, might I?'\r\n\r\n'No, perhaps I am wrong. You never had the brain.'\r\n\r\nThe vicar uttered another discordant laugh.\r\n\r\n'Brain is good! We know all about your eminence, as you call it, and\r\nhow you rose to that eminence.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'You are a bishop. How you became one we will not inquire.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'What I say. We will not inquire.'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you inquire?'\r\n\r\n'Because,' said the vicar, 'it is better not!'\r\n\r\nThe bishop's self-control left him. His face contorted with fury, he\r\ntook a step forward. And simultaneously Augustine sprang lightly into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n'Now, now, now!' said Augustine. 'Now, now, now, now, now!'\r\n\r\nThe two men stood transfixed. They stared at the intruder dumbly.\r\n\r\n'Come, come!' said Augustine.\r\n\r\nThe vicar was the first to recover. He glowered at Augustine.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean by jumping through my window?' he thundered. 'Are you\r\na curate or a harlequin?'\r\n\r\nAugustine met his gaze with an unfaltering eye.\r\n\r\n'I am a curate,' he replied, with a dignity that well became him. 'And,\r\nas a curate, I cannot stand by and see two superiors of the cloth, who\r\nare moreover old schoolfellows, forgetting themselves. It isn't right.\r\nAbsolutely not right, my old superiors of the cloth.'\r\n\r\nThe vicar bit his lip. The bishop bowed his head.\r\n\r\n'Listen,' proceeded Augustine, placing a hand on the shoulder of each.\r\n'I hate to see you two dear good chaps quarrelling like this.'\r\n\r\n'He started it,' said the vicar, sullenly.\r\n\r\n'Never mind who started it.' Augustine silenced the bishop with a curt\r\ngesture as he made to speak. 'Be sensible, my dear fellows. Respect the\r\ndecencies of debate. Exercise a little good-humoured give-and-take. You\r\nsay,' he went on, turning to the bishop, 'that our good friend here has\r\ntoo many orphreys on his chasuble?'\r\n\r\n'I do. And I stick to it.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, yes. But what,' said Augustine, soothingly, 'are a few\r\norphreys between friends? Reflect! You and our worthy vicar here were\r\nat school together. You are bound by the sacred ties of the old Alma\r\nMater. With him you sported on the green. With him you shared a crib\r\nand threw inked darts in the hour supposed to be devoted to the study\r\nof French. Do these things mean nothing to you? Do these memories touch\r\nno chord?' He turned appealingly from one to the other. 'Vicar! Bish!'\r\n\r\nThe vicar had moved away and was wiping his eyes. The bishop fumbled\r\nfor a pocket-handkerchief. There was a silence.\r\n\r\n'Sorry, Pieface,' said the bishop, in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n'Shouldn't have spoken as I did, Boko,' mumbled the vicar.\r\n\r\n'If you want to know what I think,' said the bishop, 'you are right in\r\nattributing your indisposition at the house supper to something wrong\r\nwith the turkey. I recollect saying at the time that the bird should\r\nnever have been served in such a condition.'\r\n\r\n'And when you put that white mouse in the French master's desk,' said\r\nthe vicar, 'you performed one of the noblest services to humanity of\r\nwhich there is any record. They ought to have made you a bishop on the\r\nspot.'\r\n\r\n'Pieface!'\r\n\r\n'Boko!'\r\n\r\nThe two men clasped hands.\r\n\r\n'Splendid!' said Augustine. 'Everything hotsy-totsy now?'\r\n\r\n'Quite, quite,' said the vicar.\r\n\r\n'As far as I am concerned, completely hotsy-totsy,' said the bishop. He\r\nturned to his old friend solicitously. 'You will continue to wear all\r\nthe orphreys you want--will you not, Pieface?'\r\n\r\n'No, no. I see now that I was wrong. From now on, Boko, I abandon\r\norphreys altogether.'\r\n\r\n'But, Pieface--'\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' the vicar assured him. 'I can take them or leave them\r\nalone.'\r\n\r\n'Splendid fellow!' The bishop coughed to hide his emotion, and there\r\nwas another silence. 'I think, perhaps,' he went on, after a pause,\r\n'I should be leaving you now, my dear chap, and going in search of my\r\nwife. She is with your daughter, I believe, somewhere in the village.'\r\n\r\n'They are coming up the drive now.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes, I see them. A charming girl, your daughter.'\r\n\r\nAugustine clapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Bish,' he exclaimed, 'you said a mouthful. She is the dearest,\r\nsweetest girl in the whole world. And I should be glad, vicar, if you\r\nwould give your consent to our immediate union. I love Jane with a good\r\nman's fervour, and I am happy to inform you that my sentiments are\r\nreturned. Assure us, therefore, of your approval, and I will go at once\r\nand have the banns put up.'\r\n\r\nThe vicar leaped as though he had been stung. Like so many vicars, he\r\nhad a poor opinion of curates, and he had always regarded Augustine as\r\nrather below than above the general norm or level of the despised class.\r\n\r\n'What!' he cried.\r\n\r\n'A most excellent idea,' said the bishop, beaming. 'A very happy\r\nnotion, I call it.'\r\n\r\n'My daughter!' The vicar seemed dazed. 'My daughter marry a curate!'\r\n\r\n'You were a curate once yourself, Pieface.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but not a curate like that.'\r\n\r\n'No!' said the bishop. 'You were not. Nor was I. Better for us both\r\nhad we been. This young man, I would have you know, is the most\r\noutstandingly excellent young man I have ever encountered. Are you\r\naware that scarcely an hour ago he saved me with the most consummate\r\naddress from a large shaggy dog with black spots and a kink in his\r\ntail? I was sorely pressed, Pieface, when this young man came up and,\r\nwith a readiness of resource and an accuracy of aim which it would be\r\nimpossible to over-praise, got that dog in the short ribs with a rock\r\nand sent him flying.'\r\n\r\nThe vicar seemed to be struggling with some powerful emotion. His eyes\r\nhad widened.\r\n\r\n'A dog with black spots?'\r\n\r\n'Very black spots. But no blacker, I fear, than the heart they hid.'\r\n\r\n'And he really plugged him in the short ribs?'\r\n\r\n'As far as I could see, squarely in the short ribs.'\r\n\r\nThe vicar held out his hand.\r\n\r\n'Mulliner,' he said, 'I was not aware of this. In the light of the\r\nfacts which have just been drawn to my attention, I have no hesitation\r\nin saying that my objections are removed. I have had it in for that\r\ndog since the second Sunday before Septuagesima, when he pinned me by\r\nthe ankle as I paced beside the river composing a sermon on Certain\r\nAlarming Manifestations of the So-called Modern Spirit. Take Jane. I\r\ngive my consent freely. And may she be as happy as any girl with such a\r\nhusband ought to be.'\r\n\r\nA few more affecting words were exchanged, and then the bishop and\r\nAugustine left the house. The bishop was silent and thoughtful.\r\n\r\n'I owe you a great deal, Mulliner,' he said at length.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know,' said Augustine. 'Would you say that?'\r\n\r\n'A very great deal. You saved me from a terrible disaster. Had you not\r\nleaped through that window at that precise juncture and intervened, I\r\nreally believe I should have pasted my dear old friend Brandon in the\r\neye. I was sorely exasperated.'\r\n\r\n'Our good vicar can be trying at times,' agreed Augustine.\r\n\r\n'My fist was already clenched, and I was just hauling off for the\r\nswing when you checked me. What the result would have been, had you\r\nnot exhibited a tact and discretion beyond your years, I do not like\r\nto think. I might have been unfrocked.' He shivered at the thought,\r\nthough the weather was mild. 'I could never have shown my face at the\r\nAthenaeum again. But, tut, tut!' went on the bishop, patting Augustine\r\non the shoulder, 'let us not dwell on what might have been. Speak to me\r\nof yourself. The vicar's charming daughter--you really love her?'\r\n\r\n'I do, indeed.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop's face had grown grave.\r\n\r\n'Think well, Mulliner,' he said. 'Marriage is a serious affair. Do not\r\nplunge into it without due reflection. I myself am a husband, and,\r\nthough singularly blessed in the possession of a devoted help-meet,\r\ncannot but feel sometimes that a man is better off as a bachelor.\r\nWomen, Mulliner, are odd.'\r\n\r\n'True,' said Augustine.\r\n\r\n'My own dear wife is the best of women. And, as I never weary of\r\nsaying, a good woman is a wondrous creature, cleaving to the right and\r\nthe good under all change; lovely in youthful comeliness, lovely all\r\nher life in comeliness of heart. And yet--'\r\n\r\n'And yet?' said Augustine.\r\n\r\nThe bishop mused for a moment. He wriggled a little with an expression\r\nof pain, and scratched himself between the shoulder-blades.\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll tell you,' said the bishop. 'It is a warm and pleasant day\r\ntoday, is it not?'\r\n\r\n'Exceptionally clement,' said Augustine.\r\n\r\n'A fair, sunny day, made gracious by a temperate westerly breeze. And\r\nyet, Mulliner, if you will credit my statement, my wife insisted on\r\nmy putting on my thick winter woollies this morning. Truly,' sighed\r\nthe bishop, 'as a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman\r\nwhich is without discretion. Proverbs xi, 21.'\r\n\r\n'Twenty-two,' corrected Augustine.\r\n\r\n'I should have said twenty-two. They are made of thick flannel, and I\r\nhave an exceptionally sensitive skin. Oblige me, my dear fellow, by\r\nrubbing me in the small of the back with the ferrule of your stick. I\r\nthink it will ease the irritation.'\r\n\r\n'But, my poor dear old bish,' said Augustine, sympathetically, 'this\r\nmust not be.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop shook his head ruefully.\r\n\r\n'You would not speak so hardily, Mulliner, if you knew my wife. There\r\nis no appeal from her decrees.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense,' cried Augustine, cheerily. He looked through the trees to\r\nwhere the lady bishopess, escorted by Jane, was examining a lobelia\r\nthrough her lorgnette with just the right blend of cordiality and\r\ncondescension. 'I'll fix that for you in a second.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop clutched at his arm.\r\n\r\n'My boy! What are you going to do?'\r\n\r\n'I'm just going to have a word with your wife and put the matter up to\r\nher as a reasonable woman. Thick winter woollies on a day like this!\r\nAbsurd!' said Augustine. 'Preposterous! I never heard such rot.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop gazed after him with a laden heart. Already he had come\r\nto love this young man like a son: and to see him charging so\r\nlight-heartedly into the very jaws of destruction afflicted him with\r\na deep and poignant sadness. He knew what his wife was like when even\r\nthe highest in the land attempted to thwart her; and this brave lad was\r\nbut a curate. In another moment she would be looking at him through\r\nher lorgnette: and England was littered with the shrivelled remains of\r\ncurates at whom the lady bishopess had looked through her lorgnette. He\r\nhad seen them wilt like salted slugs at the episcopal breakfast-table.\r\n\r\nHe held his breath. Augustine had reached the lady bishopess, and the\r\nlady bishopess was even now raising her lorgnette.\r\n\r\nThe bishop shut his eyes and turned away. And then--years afterwards,\r\nit seemed to him--a cheery voice hailed him: and, turning, he perceived\r\nAugustine bounding back through the trees.\r\n\r\n'It's all right, bish,' said Augustine.\r\n\r\n'All--all right?' faltered the bishop.\r\n\r\n'Yes. She says you can go and change into the thin cashmere.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop reeled.\r\n\r\n'But--but--but what did you say to her? What arguments did you employ?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I just pointed out what a warm day it was and jollied her along a\r\nbit--'\r\n\r\n'Jollied her along a bit!'\r\n\r\n'And she agreed in the most friendly and cordial manner. She has asked\r\nme to call at the Palace one of these days.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop seized Augustine's hand.\r\n\r\n'My boy,' he said in a broken voice, 'you shall do more than call at\r\nthe Palace. You shall come and live at the Palace. Become my secretary,\r\nMulliner, and name your own salary. If you intend to marry, you will\r\nrequire an increased stipend. Become my secretary, boy, and never leave\r\nmy side. I have needed somebody like you for years.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when Augustine returned to his rooms, for\r\nhe had been invited to lunch at the vicarage and had been the life and\r\nsoul of the cheery little party.\r\n\r\n'A letter for you, sir,' said Mrs Wardle, obsequiously.\r\n\r\nAugustine took the letter.\r\n\r\n'I am sorry to say I shall be leaving you shortly, Mrs Wardle.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, sir! If there's anything I can do--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, it's not that. The fact is, the bishop has made me his secretary,\r\nand I shall have to shift my toothbrush and spats to the Palace, you\r\nsee.'\r\n\r\n'Well, fancy that, sir! Why, you'll be a bishop yourself one of these\r\ndays.'\r\n\r\n'Possibly,' said Augustine. 'Possibly. And now let me read this.'\r\n\r\nHe opened the letter. A thoughtful frown appeared on his face as he\r\nread.\r\n\r\n    My dear Augustine,\r\n\r\n    I am writing in some haste to tell you that the impulsiveness of\r\n    your aunt has led to a rather serious mistake.\r\n\r\n    She tells me that she dispatched to you yesterday by parcels post a\r\n    sample bottle of my new Buck-U-Uppo, which she obtained without my\r\n    knowledge from my laboratory. Had she mentioned what she was\r\n    intending to do, I could have prevented a very unfortunate\r\n    occurrence.\r\n\r\n    Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo is of two grades or qualities--the A and the\r\n    B. The A is a mild, but strengthening, tonic designed for human\r\n    invalids. The B, on the other hand, is purely for circulation in\r\n    the animal kingdom, and was invented to fill a long-felt want\r\n    throughout our Indian possessions.\r\n\r\n    As you are doubtless aware, the favourite pastime of the Indian\r\n    Maharajahs is the hunting of the tiger of the jungle from the backs\r\n    of elephants; and it has happened frequently in the past that hunts\r\n    have been spoiled by the failure of the elephant to see eye to eye\r\n    with its owner in the matter of what constitutes sport.\r\n\r\n    Too often elephants, on sighting the tiger, have turned and\r\n    galloped home: and it was to correct this tendency on their part\r\n    that I invented Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo 'B'. One teaspoonful of the\r\n    Buck-U-Uppo 'B' administered in its morning bran-mash will cause the\r\n    most timid elephant to trumpet loudly and charge the fiercest tiger\r\n    without a qualm.\r\n\r\n    Abstain, therefore, from taking any of the contents of the bottle\r\n    you now possess,\r\n\r\n                                                        And believe me,\r\n                                               Your affectionate uncle,\r\n                                                       Wilfred Mulliner\r\n\r\nAugustine remained for some time in deep thought after perusing this\r\ncommunication. Then, rising, he whistled a few bars of the psalm\r\nappointed for the twenty-sixth of June and left the room.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later a telegraphic message was speeding over the wires.\r\n\r\nIt ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    Wilfred Mulliner,\r\n    The Gables,\r\n    Lesser Lossingham,\r\n    Salop.\r\n\r\n    Letter received. Send immediately, C.O.D., three cases of the 'B'.\r\n    'Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.' Deuteronomy xxviii, 5.\r\n\r\n                                                              Augustine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\n                           THE BISHOP'S MOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother Sunday was drawing to a close, and Mr Mulliner had come into\r\nthe bar-parlour of the Anglers' Rest wearing on his head, in place of\r\nthe seedy old wideawake which usually adorned it, a glistening top-hat.\r\nFrom this, combined with the sober black of his costume and the rather\r\ndevout voice in which he ordered hot Scotch and lemon, I deduced that\r\nhe had been attending Evensong.\r\n\r\n'Good sermon?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Quite good. The new curate preached. He seems a nice young fellow.'\r\n\r\n'Speaking of curates,' I said, 'I have often wondered what became of\r\nyour nephew--the one you were telling me about the other day.'\r\n\r\n'Augustine?'\r\n\r\n'The fellow who took the Buck-U-Uppo.'\r\n\r\n'That was Augustine. And I am pleased and not a little touched,' said\r\nMr Mulliner, beaming, 'that you should have remembered the trivial\r\nanecdote which I related. In this self-centred world one does not\r\nalways find such a sympathetic listener to one's stories. Let me see,\r\nwhere did we leave Augustine?'\r\n\r\n'He had just become the bishop's secretary and gone to live at the\r\nPalace.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes. We will take up his career, then, some six months after the\r\ndate which you have indicated.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of the good Bishop of Stortford--for, like all the\r\nprelates of our Church, he loved his labours--to embark upon the duties\r\nof the day (said Mr Mulliner) in a cheerful and jocund spirit. Usually,\r\nas he entered his study to dispatch such business as might have arisen\r\nfrom the correspondence which had reached the Palace by the first\r\npost, there was a smile upon his face and possibly upon his lips a\r\nsnatch of some gay psalm. But on the morning on which this story begins\r\nan observer would have noted that he wore a preoccupied, even a sombre,\r\nlook. Reaching the study door, he hesitated as if reluctant to enter;\r\nthen, pulling himself together with a visible effort, he turned the\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\n'Good morning, Mulliner, my boy,' he said. His manner was noticeably\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\nAugustine glanced brightly up from the pile of letters which he was\r\nopening.\r\n\r\n'Cheerio, Bish. How's the lumbago today?'\r\n\r\n'I find the pain sensibly diminished, thank you, Mulliner--in fact,\r\nalmost non-existent. This pleasant weather seems to do me good. For lo!\r\nthe winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on\r\nthe earth; the time of the singing birds is come, and the voice of the\r\nturtle is heard in the land. Song of Solomon ii, 11, 12.'\r\n\r\n'Good work,' said Augustine. 'Well, there's nothing much of interest in\r\nthese letters so far. The Vicar of St Beowulf's in the West wants to\r\nknow, How about incense?'\r\n\r\n'Tell him he mustn't.'\r\n\r\n'Right ho.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop stroked his chin uneasily. He seemed to be nerving himself\r\nfor some unpleasant task.\r\n\r\n'Mulliner,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Hullo?'\r\n\r\n'Your mention of the word \"vicar\" provides a cue, which I must not\r\nignore, for alluding to a matter which you and I had under advisement\r\nyesterday--the matter of the vacant living of Steeple Mummery.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?' said Augustine eagerly. 'Do I click?'\r\n\r\nA spasm of pain passed across the bishop's face. He shook his head\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\n'Mulliner, my boy,' he said. 'You know that I look upon you as a son\r\nand that, left to my own initiative, I would bestow this vacant living\r\non you without a moment's hesitation. But an unforeseen complication\r\nhas arisen. Unhappy lad, my wife has instructed me to give the post to\r\na cousin of hers. A fellow,' said the bishop bitterly, 'who bleats like\r\na sheep and doesn't know an alb from a reredos.'\r\n\r\nAugustine, as was only natural, was conscious of a momentary pang of\r\ndisappointment. But he was a Mulliner and a sportsman.\r\n\r\n'Don't give it another thought, Bish,' he said cordially. 'I quite\r\nunderstand. I don't say I hadn't hopes, but no doubt there will be\r\nanother along in a minute.'\r\n\r\n'You know how it is,' said the bishop, looking cautiously round to see\r\nthat the door was closed. 'It is better to dwell in a corner of the\r\nhousetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house. Proverbs xxi, 9.'\r\n\r\n'A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are\r\nalike. Proverbs xxvii, 15,' agreed Augustine.\r\n\r\n'Exactly. How well you understand me, Mulliner.'\r\n\r\n'Meanwhile,' said Augustine, holding up a letter, 'here's something\r\nthat calls for attention. It's from a bird of the name of Trevor\r\nEntwhistle.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed? An old schoolfellow of mine. He is now Headmaster of\r\nHarchester, the foundation at which we both received our early\r\neducation. What does he say?'\r\n\r\n'He wants to know if you will run down for a few days and unveil a\r\nstatue which they have just put up to Lord Hemel of Hempstead.'\r\n\r\n'Another old schoolfellow. We called him Fatty.'\r\n\r\n'There's a postscript over the page. He says he still has a dozen of\r\nthe '87 port.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop pursed his lips.\r\n\r\n'These earthly considerations do not weigh with me so much as old\r\nCatsmeat--as the Reverend Trevor Entwhistle seems to suppose. However,\r\none must not neglect the call of the dear old school. We will certainly\r\ngo.'\r\n\r\n'We?'\r\n\r\n'I shall require your company. I think you will like Harchester,\r\nMulliner. A noble pile, founded by the seventh Henry.'\r\n\r\n'I know it well. A young brother of mine is there.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed? Dear me,' mused the bishop, 'it must be twenty years and more\r\nsince I last visited Harchester. I shall enjoy seeing the old, familiar\r\nscenes once again. After all, Mulliner, to whatever eminence we may\r\nsoar, howsoever great may be the prizes which life has bestowed upon\r\nus, we never wholly lose our sentiment for the dear old school. It is\r\nour Alma Mater, Mulliner, the gentle mother that has set our hesitating\r\nfootsteps on the--'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely,' said Augustine.\r\n\r\n'And, as we grow older, we see that never can we recapture the old,\r\ncareless gaiety of our school days. Life was not complex then,\r\nMulliner. Life in that halcyon period was free from problems. We were\r\nnot faced with the necessity of disappointing our friends.'\r\n\r\n'Now listen, Bish,' said Augustine cheerily, 'if you're still worrying\r\nabout that living, forget it. Look at me. I'm quite chirpy, aren't I?'\r\n\r\nThe bishop sighed.\r\n\r\n'I wish I had your sunny resilience, Mulliner. How do you manage it?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I keep smiling, and take the Buck-U-Uppo daily.'\r\n\r\n'The Buck-U-Uppo?'\r\n\r\n'It's a tonic my uncle Wilfred invented. Works like magic.'\r\n\r\n'I must ask you to let me try it one of these days. For somehow,\r\nMulliner, I am finding life a little grey. What on earth,' said the\r\nbishop, half to himself and speaking peevishly, 'they wanted to put up\r\na statue to old Fatty for, I can't imagine. A fellow who used to throw\r\ninked darts at people. However,' he continued, abruptly abandoning\r\nthis train of thought, 'that is neither here nor there. If the Board\r\nof Governors of Harchester College has decided that Lord Hemel of\r\nHempstead has by his services in the public weal earned a statue, it is\r\nnot for us to cavil. Write to Mr Entwhistle, Mulliner, and say that I\r\nshall be delighted.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough, as he had told Augustine, fully twenty years had passed\r\nsince his last visit to Harchester, the bishop found, somewhat to his\r\nsurprise, that little or no alteration had taken place in the grounds,\r\nbuildings, and personnel of the school. It seemed to him almost\r\nprecisely the same as it had been on the day, forty-three years before,\r\nwhen he had first come there as a new boy.\r\n\r\nThere was the tuck-shop where, a lissom stripling with bony elbows,\r\nhe had shoved and pushed so often in order to get near the counter\r\nand snaffle a jam-sandwich in the eleven o'clock recess. There were\r\nthe baths, the fives courts, the football fields, the library, the\r\ngymnasium, the gravel, the chestnut trees, all just as they had been\r\nwhen the only thing he knew about bishops was that they wore bootlaces\r\nin their hats.\r\n\r\nThe sole change that he could see was that on the triangle of turf\r\nin front of the library there had been erected a granite pedestal\r\nsurmounted by a shapeless something swathed in a large sheet--the\r\nstatue to Lord Hemel of Hempstead which he had come down to unveil.\r\n\r\nAnd gradually, as his visit proceeded, there began to steal over him an\r\nemotion which defied analysis.\r\n\r\nAt first he supposed it to be a natural sentimentality. But, had it\r\nbeen that, would it not have been a more pleasurable emotion? For his\r\nfeelings had begun to be far from unmixedly agreeable. Once, when\r\nrounding a corner, he came upon the captain of football in all his\r\nmajesty, there had swept over him a hideous blend of fear and shame\r\nwhich had made his gaitered legs wobble like jellies. The captain of\r\nfootball doffed his cap respectfully, and the feeling passed as quickly\r\nas it had come: but not so soon that the bishop had not recognized it.\r\nIt was exactly the feeling he had been wont to have forty-odd years ago\r\nwhen, sneaking softly away from football practice, he had encountered\r\none in authority.\r\n\r\nThe bishop was puzzled. It was as if some fairy had touched him with\r\nher wand, sweeping away the years and making him an inky-faced boy\r\nagain. Day by day this illusion grew, the constant society of the\r\nRev. Trevor Entwhistle doing much to foster it. For young Catsmeat\r\nEntwhistle had been the bishop's particular crony at Harchester,\r\nand he seemed to have altered his appearance since those days in no\r\nway whatsoever. The bishop had had a nasty shock when, entering the\r\nheadmaster's study on the third morning of his visit, he found him\r\nsitting in the headmaster's chair with the headmaster's cap and gown\r\non. It seemed to him that young Catsmeat, in order to indulge his\r\ndistorted sense of humour, was taking the most frightful risk. Suppose\r\nthe Old Man were to come in and cop him!\r\n\r\nAltogether, it was a relief to the bishop when the day of the unveiling\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe actual ceremony, however, he found both tedious and irritating.\r\nLord Hemel of Hempstead had not been a favourite of his in their school\r\ndays, and there was something extremely disagreeable to him in being\r\nobliged to roll out sonorous periods in his praise.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, he had suffered from the very start of the\r\nproceedings from a bad attack of stage fright. He could not help\r\nthinking that he must look the most awful chump standing up there in\r\nfront of all those people and spouting. He half expected one of the\r\nprefects in the audience to step up and clout his head and tell him not\r\nto be a funny young swine.\r\n\r\nHowever, no disaster of this nature occurred. Indeed, his speech was\r\nnotably successful.\r\n\r\n'My dear Bishop,' said old General Bloodenough, the Chairman of the\r\nCollege Board of Governors, shaking his hand at the conclusion of the\r\nunveiling, 'your magnificent oration put my own feeble efforts to\r\nshame, put them to shame, to shame. You were astounding!'\r\n\r\n'Thanks awfully,' mumbled the bishop, blushing and shuffling his feet.\r\n\r\nThe weariness which had come upon the bishop as the result of the\r\nprolonged ceremony seemed to grow as the day wore on. By the time he\r\nwas seated in the headmaster's study after dinner he was in the grip of\r\na severe headache.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Trevor Entwhistle also appeared jaded.\r\n\r\n'These affairs are somewhat fatiguing, bishop,' he said, stifling a\r\nyawn.\r\n\r\n'They are, indeed, Headmaster.'\r\n\r\n'Even the '87 port seems an inefficient restorative.'\r\n\r\n'Markedly inefficient. I wonder,' said the bishop, struck with an idea,\r\n'if a little Buck-U-Uppo might not alleviate our exhaustion. It is\r\na tonic of some kind which my secretary is in the habit of taking.\r\nIt certainly appears to do him good. A livelier, more vigorous young\r\nfellow I have never seen. Suppose we ask your butler to go to his room\r\nand borrow the bottle? I am sure he will be delighted to give it to us.'\r\n\r\n'By all means.'\r\n\r\nThe butler, dispatched to Augustine's room, returned with a bottle\r\nhalf full of a thick, dark-coloured liquid. The bishop examined it\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'I see there are no directions given as to the requisite dose,' he\r\nsaid. 'However, I do not like to keep disturbing your butler, who has\r\nnow doubtless returned to his pantry and is once more settling down to\r\nthe enjoyment of a well-earned rest after a day more than ordinarily\r\nfraught with toil and anxiety. Suppose we use our own judgement?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly. Is it nasty?'\r\n\r\nThe bishop licked the cork warily.\r\n\r\n'No. I should not call it nasty. The taste, while individual and\r\ndistinctive and even striking, is by no means disagreeable.'\r\n\r\n'Then let us take a glassful apiece.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop filled two portly wine-glasses with the fluid, and they sat\r\nsipping gravely.\r\n\r\n'It's rather good,' said the bishop.\r\n\r\n'Distinctly good,' said the headmaster.\r\n\r\n'It sort of sends a kind of glow over you.'\r\n\r\n'A noticeable glow.'\r\n\r\n'A little more, Headmaster?'\r\n\r\n'No, I thank you.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, come.'\r\n\r\n'Well, just a spot, bishop, if you insist.'\r\n\r\n'It's rather good,' said the bishop.\r\n\r\n'Distinctly good,' said the headmaster.\r\n\r\nNow you, who have listened to the story of Augustine's previous\r\nadventures with the Buck-U-Uppo, are aware that my brother Wilfred\r\ninvented it primarily with the object of providing Indian Rajahs with\r\na specific which would encourage their elephants to face the tiger of\r\nthe jungle with a jaunty sang-froid: and he had advocated as a medium\r\ndose for an adult elephant a teaspoonful stirred up with its morning\r\nbran-mash. It is not surprising, therefore, that after they had drunk\r\ntwo wine-glassfuls apiece of the mixture the outlook on life of both\r\nthe bishop and the headmaster began to undergo a marked change.\r\n\r\nTheir fatigue had left them, and with it the depression which a\r\nfew moments before had been weighing on them so heavily. Both were\r\nconscious of an extraordinary feeling of good cheer, and the odd\r\nillusion of extreme youth which had been upon the bishop since his\r\narrival at Harchester was now more pronounced than ever. He felt a\r\nyoungish and rather rowdy fifteen.\r\n\r\n'Where does your butler sleep, Catsmeat?' he asked, after a thoughtful\r\npause.\r\n\r\n'I don't know. Why?'\r\n\r\n'I was only thinking that it would be a lark to go and put a booby-trap\r\non his door.'\r\n\r\nThe headmaster's eyes glistened.\r\n\r\n'Yes, wouldn't it!' he said.\r\n\r\nThey mused for a while. Then the headmaster uttered a deep chuckle.\r\n\r\n'What are you giggling about?' asked the bishop.\r\n\r\n'I was only thinking what a priceless ass you looked this afternoon,\r\ntalking all that rot about old Fatty.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of his cheerfulness, a frown passed over the bishop's fine\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n'It went very much against the grain to speak in terms of eulogy--yes,\r\nfulsome eulogy--of one whom we both know to have been a blighter of the\r\nworst description. Where does Fatty get off, having statues put up to\r\nhim?'\r\n\r\n'Oh well, he's an Empire builder, I suppose,' said the headmaster, who\r\nwas a fair-minded man.\r\n\r\n'Just the sort of thing he would be,' grumbled the bishop. 'Shoving\r\nhimself forward! If ever there was a chap I barred, it was Fatty.'\r\n\r\n'Me, too,' agreed the headmaster. 'Beastly laugh he'd got. Like glue\r\npouring out of a jug.'\r\n\r\n'Greedy little beast, if you remember. A fellow in his house told me\r\nhe once ate three slices of brown boot-polish spread on bread after he\r\nhad finished the potted meat.'\r\n\r\n'Between you and me, I always suspected him of swiping buns at the\r\nschool shop. I don't wish to make rash charges unsupported by true\r\nevidence, but it always seemed to me extremely odd that, whatever time\r\nof the term it was, and however hard up everybody else might be, you\r\nnever saw Fatty without his bun.'\r\n\r\n'Catsmeat,' said the bishop, 'I'll tell you something about Fatty that\r\nisn't generally known. In a scrum in the final House Match in the year\r\n1888 he deliberately hoofed me on the shin.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean that?'\r\n\r\n'I do.'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!'\r\n\r\n'An ordinary hack on the shin,' said the bishop coldly, 'no fellow\r\nminds. It is part of the give and take of normal social life. But when\r\na bounder deliberately hauls off and lets drive at you with the sole\r\nintention of laying you out, it--well, it's a bit thick.'\r\n\r\n'And those chumps of Governors have put up a statue to him!'\r\n\r\nThe bishop leaned forward and lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n'Catsmeat.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'Do you know what?'\r\n\r\n'No, what?'\r\n\r\n'What we ought to do is to wait till twelve o'clock or so, till there's\r\nno one about, and then beetle out and paint that statue blue.'\r\n\r\n'Why not pink?'\r\n\r\n'Pink, if you prefer it.'\r\n\r\n'Pink's a nice colour.'\r\n\r\n'It is. Very nice.'\r\n\r\n'Besides, I know where I can lay my hands on some pink paint.'\r\n\r\n'You do?'\r\n\r\n'Gobs of it.'\r\n\r\n'Peace be on thy walls, Catsmeat, and prosperity within thy palaces,'\r\nsaid the bishop. 'Proverbs cxxxi, 6.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the bishop, as he closed the front door noiselessly behind\r\nhim two hours later, that providence, always on the side of the just,\r\nwas extending itself in its efforts to make this little enterprise of\r\nhis a success. All the conditions were admirable for statue-painting.\r\nThe rain which had been falling during the evening had stopped: and a\r\nmoon, which might have proved an embarrassment, was conveniently hidden\r\nbehind a bank of clouds.\r\n\r\nAs regarded human interference, they had nothing to alarm them. No\r\nplace in the world is so deserted as the ground of a school after\r\nmidnight. Fatty's statue might have been in the middle of the Sahara.\r\nThey climbed the pedestal, and, taking turns fairly with the brush,\r\nsoon accomplished the task which their sense of duty had indicated\r\nto them. It was only when, treading warily lest their steps should\r\nbe heard on the gravel drive, they again reached the front door that\r\nanything occurred to mar the harmony of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n'What are you waiting for?' whispered the bishop, as his companion\r\nlingered on the top step.\r\n\r\n'Half a second,' said the headmaster in a muffled voice. 'It may be in\r\nanother pocket.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'My key.'\r\n\r\n'Have you lost your key?'\r\n\r\n'I believe I have.'\r\n\r\n'Catsmeat,' said the bishop, with grave censure, 'this is the last time\r\nI come out painting statues with you.'\r\n\r\n'I must have dropped it somewhere.'\r\n\r\n'What shall we do?'\r\n\r\n'There's just a chance the scullery window may be open.'\r\n\r\nBut the scullery window was not open. Careful, vigilant, and faithful\r\nto his trust, the butler, on retiring to rest, had fastened it and\r\nclosed the shutters. They were locked out.\r\n\r\nBut it has been well said that it is the lessons which we learn in our\r\nboyhood days at school that prepare us for the problems of life in the\r\nlarger world outside. Stealing back from the mists of the past, there\r\ncame to the bishop a sudden memory.\r\n\r\n'Catsmeat!'\r\n\r\n'Hullo?'\r\n\r\n'If you haven't been mucking the place up with alterations and\r\nimprovements, there should be a water-pipe round at the back, leading\r\nto one of the upstairs windows.'\r\n\r\nMemory had not played him false. There, nestling in the ivy, was the\r\npipe up and down which he had been wont to climb when, a pie-faced lad\r\nin the summer of '86, he had broken out of this house in order to take\r\nnocturnal swims in the river.\r\n\r\n'Up you go,' he said briefly.\r\n\r\nThe headmaster required no further urging. And presently the two were\r\nmaking good time up the side of the house.\r\n\r\nIt was just as they reached the window and just after the bishop had\r\ninformed his old friend that, if he kicked him on the head again, he'd\r\nhear of it, that the window was suddenly flung open.\r\n\r\n'Who's that?' said a clear young voice.\r\n\r\nThe headmaster was frankly taken aback. Dim though the light was,\r\nhe could see that the man leaning out of the window was poising in\r\nreadiness a very nasty-looking golf-club: and his first impulse was\r\nto reveal his identity and so clear himself of the suspicion of being\r\nthe marauder for whom he gathered the other had mistaken him. Then\r\nthere presented themselves to him certain objections to revealing his\r\nidentity, and he hung there in silence, unable to think of a suitable\r\nnext move.\r\n\r\nThe bishop was a man of readier resource.\r\n\r\n'Tell him we're a couple of cats belonging to the cook,' he whispered.\r\n\r\nIt was painful for one of the headmaster's scrupulous rectitude and\r\nhonesty to stoop to such a falsehood, but it seemed the only course to\r\npursue.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' he said, forcing a note of easy geniality into his\r\nvoice. 'We're a couple of cats.'\r\n\r\n'Cat-burglars?'\r\n\r\n'No. Just ordinary cats.'\r\n\r\n'Belonging to the cook,' prompted the bishop from below.\r\n\r\n'Belonging to the cook,' added the headmaster.\r\n\r\n'I see,' said the man at the window. 'Well, in that case, right ho!'\r\n\r\nHe stood aside to allow them to enter. The bishop, an artist at heart,\r\nmewed gratefully as he passed, to add verisimilitude to the deception:\r\nand then made for his bedroom, accompanied by the headmaster. The\r\nepisode was apparently closed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the headmaster was disturbed by a certain uneasiness.\r\n\r\n'Do you suppose he thought we really were cats?' he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n'I am not sure,' said the bishop. 'But I think we deceived him by the\r\nnonchalance of our demeanour.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I think we did. Who was he?'\r\n\r\n'My secretary. The young fellow I was speaking of, who lent us that\r\ncapital tonic.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, then that's all right. He wouldn't give you away.'\r\n\r\n'No. And there is nothing else that can possibly lead to our being\r\nsuspected. We left no clue whatsoever.'\r\n\r\n'All the same,' said the headmaster thoughtfully, 'I'm beginning to\r\nwonder whether it was in the best sense of the word judicious to have\r\npainted that statue.'\r\n\r\n'Somebody had to,' said the bishop stoutly.\r\n\r\n'Yes, that's true,' said the headmaster, brightening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bishop slept late on the following morning, and partook of his\r\nfrugal breakfast in bed. The day, which so often brings remorse,\r\nbrought none to him. Something attempted, something done had earned a\r\nnight's repose: and he had no regrets--except that, now that it was\r\nall over, he was not sure that blue paint would not have been more\r\neffective. However, his old friend had pleaded so strongly for the pink\r\nthat it would have been difficult for himself, as a guest, to override\r\nthe wishes of his host. Still, blue would undoubtedly have been very\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock on the door, and Augustine entered.\r\n\r\n'Morning, Bish.'\r\n\r\n'Good morning, Mulliner,' said the bishop affably. 'I have lain\r\nsomewhat late today.'\r\n\r\n'I say, Bish,' asked Augustine, a little anxiously. 'Did you take a\r\nvery big dose of the Buck-U-Uppo last night?'\r\n\r\n'Big? No. As I recollect, quite small. Barely two ordinary wine-glasses\r\nfull.'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!'\r\n\r\n'Why do you ask, my dear fellow?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, nothing. No particular reason. I just thought your manner seemed a\r\nlittle strange on the water-pipe, that's all.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop was conscious of a touch of chagrin.\r\n\r\n'Then you saw through our--er--innocent deception?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'I had been taking a little stroll with the headmaster,' explained the\r\nbishop, 'and he had mislaid his key. How beautiful is Nature at night,\r\nMulliner! The dark, fathomless skies, the little winds that seem to\r\nwhisper secrets in one's ear, the scent of growing things.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Augustine. He paused. 'Rather a row on this morning.\r\nSomebody appears to have painted Lord Hemel of Hempstead's statue last\r\nnight.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, well,' said the bishop tolerantly, 'boys will be boys.'\r\n\r\n'It's a most mysterious business.'\r\n\r\n'No doubt, no doubt. But, after all, Mulliner, is not all Life a\r\nmystery?'\r\n\r\n'And what makes it still more mysterious is that they found your\r\nshovel-hat on the statue's head.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop started up.\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely.'\r\n\r\n'Mulliner,' said the bishop, 'leave me. I have one or two matters on\r\nwhich I wish to meditate.'\r\n\r\nHe dressed hastily, his numbed fingers fumbling with his gaiters. It\r\nall came back to him now. Yes, he could remember putting the hat on the\r\nstatue's head. It had seemed a good thing to do at the time, and he had\r\ndone it. How little we guess at the moment how far-reaching our most\r\ntrivial actions may be!\r\n\r\nThe headmaster was over at the school, instructing the Sixth Form\r\nin Greek Composition: and he was obliged to wait, chafing, until\r\ntwelve-thirty, when the bell rang for the half-way halt in the day's\r\nwork. He stood at the study window, watching with ill-controlled\r\nimpatience, and presently the headmaster appeared, walking heavily like\r\none on whose mind there is a weight.\r\n\r\n'Well?' cried the bishop, as he entered the study.\r\n\r\nThe headmaster doffed his cap and gown, and sank limply into a chair.\r\n\r\n'I cannot conceive,' he groaned, 'what madness had me in its grip last\r\nnight.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop was shaken, but he could not countenance such an attitude as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n'I do not understand you, Headmaster,' he said stiffly. 'It was our\r\nsimple duty, as a protest against the undue exaltation of one whom we\r\nboth know to have been a most unpleasant school-mate, to paint that\r\nstatue.'\r\n\r\n'And I suppose it was your duty to leave your hat on its head?'\r\n\r\n'Now there,' said the bishop, 'I may possibly have gone a little too\r\nfar.' He coughed. 'Has that perhaps somewhat ill-considered action led\r\nto the harbouring of suspicions by those in authority?'\r\n\r\n'They don't know what to think.'\r\n\r\n'What is the view of the Board of Governors?'\r\n\r\n'They insist on my finding the culprit. Should I fail to do so, they\r\nhint at the gravest consequences.'\r\n\r\n'You mean they will deprive you of your headmastership?'\r\n\r\n'That is what they imply. I shall be asked to hand in my resignation.\r\nAnd, if that happens, bim goes my chance of ever being a bishop.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's not all jam being a bishop. You wouldn't enjoy it,\r\nCatsmeat.'\r\n\r\n'All very well for you to talk, Boko. You got me into this, you silly\r\nass.'\r\n\r\n'I like that! You were just as keen on it as I was.'\r\n\r\n'You suggested it.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you jumped at the suggestion.'\r\n\r\nThe two men had faced each other heatedly, and for a moment it seemed\r\nas if there was to be a serious falling-out. Then the bishop recovered\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n'Catsmeat,' he said, with that wonderful smile of his, taking the\r\nother's hand, 'this is unworthy of us. We must not quarrel. We must put\r\nour heads together and see if there is not some avenue of escape from\r\nthe unfortunate position in which, however creditable our motives, we\r\nappear to have placed ourselves. How would it be--?'\r\n\r\n'I thought of that,' said the headmaster. 'It wouldn't do a bit of\r\ngood. Of course, we might--'\r\n\r\n'No, that's no use, either,' said the bishop.\r\n\r\nThey sat for a while in meditative silence. And, as they sat, the door\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n'General Bloodenough,' announced the butler.\r\n\r\n'Oh, that I had wings like a dove. Psalm xlv, 6,' muttered the bishop.\r\n\r\nHis desire to be wafted from that spot with all available speed could\r\nhardly be considered unreasonable. General Sir Hector Bloodenough,\r\nV.C., K.C.I.E., M.V.O., on retiring from the army, had been for many\r\nyears, until his final return to England, in charge of the Secret\r\nService in Western Africa, where his unerring acumen had won for him\r\nfrom the natives the soubriquet of Wah-nah-B'gosh-B'jingo--which,\r\nfreely translated, means Big Chief Who Can See Through The Hole In A\r\nDoughnut.\r\n\r\nA man impossible to deceive. The last man the bishop would have wished\r\nto be conducting the present investigations.\r\n\r\nThe general stalked into the room. He had keen blue eyes, topped by\r\nbushy white eyebrows: and the bishop found his gaze far too piercing to\r\nbe agreeable.\r\n\r\n'Bad business, this,' he said. 'Bad business. Bad business.'\r\n\r\n'It is, indeed,' faltered the bishop.\r\n\r\n'Shocking bad business. Shocking. Shocking. Do you know what we found\r\non the head of that statue, eh? that statue, that statue? Your hat,\r\nbishop. Your hat. Your hat.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop made an attempt to rally. His mind was in a whirl, for the\r\ngeneral's habit of repeating everything three times had the effect on\r\nhim of making his last night's escapade seem three times as bad. He now\r\nsaw himself on the verge of standing convicted of having painted three\r\nstatues with three pots of pink paint, and of having placed on the head\r\nof each one of a trio of shovel-hats. But he was a strong man, and he\r\ndid his best.\r\n\r\n'You say my hat?' he retorted with spirit. 'How do you know it was my\r\nhat? There may have been hundreds of bishops dodging about the school\r\ngrounds last night.'\r\n\r\n'Got your name in it. Your name. Your name.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop clutched at the arm of the chair in which he sat. The\r\ngeneral's eyes were piercing him through and through, and every moment\r\nhe felt more like a sheep that has had the misfortune to encounter a\r\npotted meat manufacturer. He was on the point of protesting that the\r\nwriting in the hat was probably a forgery, when there was a tap at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n'Come in,' cried the headmaster, who had been cowering in his seat.\r\n\r\nThere entered a small boy in an Eton suit, whose face seemed to the\r\nbishop vaguely familiar. It was a face that closely resembled a ripe\r\ntomato with a nose stuck on it, but that was not what had struck the\r\nbishop. It was of something other than tomatoes that this lad reminded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Sir, please, sir,' said the boy.\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, yes,' said General Bloodenough testily. 'Run away, my boy,\r\nrun away, run away. Can't you see we're busy?'\r\n\r\n'But, sir, please, sir, it's about the statue.'\r\n\r\n'What about the statue? What about it? What about it?'\r\n\r\n'Sir, please, sir, it was me.'\r\n\r\n'What! What! What! What! What!'\r\n\r\nThe bishop, the general, and the headmaster had spoken simultaneously:\r\nand the 'Whats' had been distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n    The Bishop      1\r\n    The General     3\r\n    The Headmaster  1\r\n\r\nmaking five in all. Having uttered these ejaculations, they sat staring\r\nat the boy, who turned a brighter vermilion.\r\n\r\n'What are you saying?' cried the headmaster. 'You painted that statue?'\r\n\r\n'Sir, yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You?' said the bishop.\r\n\r\n'Sir, yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You? You? You?' said the general.\r\n\r\n'Sir, yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nThere was a quivering pause. The bishop looked at the headmaster. The\r\nheadmaster looked at the bishop. The general looked at the boy. The boy\r\nlooked at the floor.\r\n\r\nThe general was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n'Monstrous!' he exclaimed. 'Monstrous. Monstrous. Never heard of such a\r\nthing. This boy must be expelled, Headmaster. Expelled. Ex--'\r\n\r\n'No!' said the headmaster in a ringing voice.\r\n\r\n'Then flogged within an inch of his life. Within an inch. An inch.'\r\n\r\n'No!' A strange, new dignity seemed to have descended upon the Rev.\r\nTrevor Entwhistle. He was breathing a little quickly through his nose,\r\nand his eyes had assumed a somewhat prawn-like aspect. 'In matters\r\nof school discipline, general, I must with all deference claim to be\r\nparamount. I will deal with this case as I think best. In my opinion\r\nthis is not an occasion for severity. You agree with me, bishop?'\r\n\r\nThe bishop came to himself with a start. He had been thinking of an\r\narticle which he had just completed for a leading review on the subject\r\nof Miracles, and was regretting that the tone he had taken, though\r\nin keeping with the trend of Modern Thought, had been tinged with\r\nsomething approaching scepticism.\r\n\r\n'Oh, entirely,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Then all I can say,' fumed the general, 'is that I wash my hands of\r\nthe whole business, the whole business, the whole business. And if\r\nthis is the way our boys are being brought up nowadays, no wonder the\r\ncountry is going to the dogs, the dogs, going to the dogs.'\r\n\r\nThe door slammed behind him. The headmaster turned to the boy, a\r\nkindly, winning smile upon his face.\r\n\r\n'No doubt,' he said, 'you now regret this rash act?'\r\n\r\n'Sir, yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And you would not do it again?'\r\n\r\n'Sir, no, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Then I think,' said the headmaster cheerily, 'that we may deal\r\nleniently with what, after all, was but a boyish prank, eh, bishop?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, decidedly, Headmaster.'\r\n\r\n'Quite the sort of thing--ha, ha!--that you or I might have\r\ndone--er--at his age?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, quite.'\r\n\r\n'Then you shall write me twenty lines of Virgil, Mulliner, and we will\r\nsay no more about it.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop sprang from his chair.\r\n\r\n'Mulliner! Did you say Mulliner?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'I have a secretary of that name. Are you, by any chance, a relation of\r\nhis, my lad?'\r\n\r\n'Sir, yes, sir. Brother.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' said the bishop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bishop found Augustine in the garden, squirting whale-oil solution\r\non the rose-bushes, for he was an enthusiastic horticulturist. He\r\nplaced an affectionate hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Mulliner,' he said, 'do not think that I have not detected your hidden\r\nhand behind this astonishing occurrence.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?' said Augustine. 'What astonishing occurrence?'\r\n\r\n'As you are aware, Mulliner, last night, from motives which I can\r\nassure you were honourable and in accord with the truest spirit of\r\nsound Churchmanship, the Rev. Trevor Entwhistle and I were compelled\r\nto go out and paint old Fatty Hemel's statue pink. Just now, in the\r\nheadmaster's study, a boy confessed that he had done it. That boy,\r\nMulliner, was your brother.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes?'\r\n\r\n'It was you who, in order to save me, inspired him to that confession.\r\nDo not deny it, Mulliner.'\r\n\r\nAugustine smiled an embarrassed smile.\r\n\r\n'It was nothing, Bish, nothing at all.'\r\n\r\n'I trust the matter did not involve you in any too great expense. From\r\nwhat I know of brothers, the lad was scarcely likely to have carried\r\nthrough this benevolent ruse for nothing.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, just a couple of quid. He wanted three, but I beat him down.\r\nPreposterous, I mean to say,' said Augustine warmly. 'Three quid for a\r\nperfectly simple, easy job like that? And so I told him.'\r\n\r\n'It shall be returned to you, Mulliner.'\r\n\r\n'No, no, Bish.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Mulliner, it shall be returned to you. I have not the sum on\r\nmy person, but I will forward you a cheque to your new address, The\r\nVicarage, Steeple Mummery, Hants.'\r\n\r\nAugustine's eyes filled with sudden tears. He grasped the other's hand.\r\n\r\n'Bish,' he said in a choking voice, 'I don't know how to thank you.\r\nBut--have you considered?'\r\n\r\n'Considered?'\r\n\r\n'The wife of thy bosom. Deuteronomy xiii, 6. What will she say when you\r\ntell her?'\r\n\r\nThe bishop's eyes gleamed with a resolute light.\r\n\r\n'Mulliner,' he said, 'the point you raise had not escaped me. But I\r\nhave the situation well in hand. A bird of the air shall carry the\r\nvoice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. Ecclesiastes x,\r\n20. I shall inform her of my decision on the long-distance telephone.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\n                             CAME THE DAWN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man in the corner took a sip of stout-and-mild, and proceeded to\r\npoint the moral of the story which he had just told us.\r\n\r\n'Yes, gentlemen,' he said, 'Shakespeare was right. There's a divinity\r\nthat shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.'\r\n\r\nWe nodded. He had been speaking of a favourite dog of his which,\r\nentered recently by some error in a local cat show, had taken first\r\nprize in the class for short-haired tortoiseshells; and we all thought\r\nthe quotation well-chosen and apposite.\r\n\r\n'There is, indeed,' said Mr Mulliner. 'A rather similar thing happened\r\nto my nephew Lancelot.'\r\n\r\nIn the nightly reunions in the bar-parlour of the Anglers' Rest we have\r\nbeen trained to believe almost anything of Mr Mulliner's relatives, but\r\nthis, we felt, was a little too much.\r\n\r\n'You mean to say your nephew Lancelot took a prize at a cat show?'\r\n\r\n'No, no,' said Mr Mulliner hastily. 'Certainly not. I have never\r\ndeviated from the truth in my life, and I hope I never shall. No\r\nMulliner has ever taken a prize at a cat show. No Mulliner, indeed, to\r\nthe best of my knowledge, has even been entered for such a competition.\r\nWhat I meant was that the fact that we never know what the future holds\r\nin store for us was well exemplified in the case of my nephew Lancelot,\r\njust as it was in the case of this gentleman's dog which suddenly found\r\nitself transformed for all practical purposes into a short-haired\r\ntortoiseshell cat. It is rather a curious story, and provides a good\r\nillustration of the adage that you never can tell and that it is always\r\ndarkest before the dawn.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time at which my story opens (said Mr Mulliner) Lancelot,\r\nthen twenty-four years of age and recently come down from Oxford,\r\nwas spending a few days with old Jeremiah Briggs, the founder and\r\nproprietor of the famous Briggs's Breakfast Pickles, on the latter's\r\nyacht at Cowes.\r\n\r\nThis Jeremiah Briggs was Lancelot's uncle on the mother's side, and\r\nhe had always interested himself in the boy. It was he who had sent\r\nhim to the University; and it was the great wish of his heart that his\r\nnephew, on completing his education, should join him in the business.\r\nIt was consequently a shock to the poor old gentleman when, as they sat\r\ntogether on deck on the first morning of the visit, Lancelot, while\r\nexpressing the greatest respect for pickles as a class, firmly refused\r\nto start in and learn the business from the bottom up.\r\n\r\n'The fact is, uncle,' he said, 'I have mapped out a career for myself\r\non far different lines. I am a poet.'\r\n\r\n'A poet? When did you feel this coming on?'\r\n\r\n'Shortly after my twenty-second birthday.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said the old man, overcoming his first natural feeling of\r\nrepulsion, 'I don't see why that should stop us getting together. I use\r\nquite a lot of poetry in my business.'\r\n\r\n'I fear I could not bring myself to commercialize my Muse.'\r\n\r\n'Young man,' said Mr Briggs, 'if an onion with a head like yours came\r\ninto my factory, I would refuse to pickle it.'\r\n\r\nHe stumped below, thoroughly incensed. But Lancelot merely uttered a\r\nlight laugh. He was young; it was summer; the sky was blue; the sun\r\nwas shining; and the things in the world that really mattered were\r\nnot cucumbers and vinegar but Romance and Love. Oh, he felt, for some\r\ndelightful girl to come along on whom he might lavish all the pent-up\r\nfervour which had been sizzling inside him for weeks!\r\n\r\nAnd at this moment he saw her.\r\n\r\nShe was leaning against the rail of a yacht that lay at its moorings\r\nsome forty yards away; and, as he beheld her, Lancelot's heart leaped\r\nlike a young gherkin in the boiling-vat. In her face, it seemed to him,\r\nwas concentrated all the beauty of all the ages. Confronted with this\r\ngirl, Cleopatra would have looked like Nellie Wallace, and Helen of\r\nTroy might have been her plain sister. He was still gazing at her in\r\na sort of trance, when the bell sounded for luncheon and he had to go\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nAll through the meal, while his uncle spoke of pickled walnuts he had\r\nknown, Lancelot remained in a reverie. He was counting the minutes\r\nuntil he could get on deck and start goggling again. Judge, therefore,\r\nof his dismay when, on bounding up the companionway, he found that the\r\nother yacht had disappeared. He recalled now having heard a sort of\r\nharsh, grating noise towards the end of luncheon; but at the time he\r\nhad merely thought it was his uncle eating celery. Too late he realized\r\nthat it must have been the raising of the anchor-chain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough at heart a dreamer, Lancelot Mulliner was not without a\r\ncertain practical streak. Thinking the matter over, he soon hit upon a\r\nrough plan of action for getting on the track of the fair unknown who\r\nhad flashed in and out of his life with such tragic abruptness. A girl\r\nlike that--beautiful, lissom, and--as far as he had been able to tell\r\nat such long range--gimp, was sure to be fond of dancing. The chances\r\nwere, therefore, that sooner or later he would find her at some night\r\nclub or other.\r\n\r\nHe started, accordingly, to make the round of the night clubs. As\r\nsoon as one was raided, he went on to another. Within a month he had\r\nvisited the Mauve Mouse, the Scarlet Centipede, the Vicious Cheese, the\r\nGay Fritter, the Placid Prune, the Café de Bologna, Billy's, Milly's,\r\nIke's, Spike's, Mike's, and the Ham and Beef. And it was at the Ham and\r\nBeef that at last he found her.\r\n\r\nHe had gone there one evening for the fifth time, principally because\r\nat that establishment there were a couple of speciality dancers to\r\nwhom he had taken a dislike shared by virtually every thinking man in\r\nLondon. It had always seemed to him that one of these nights the male\r\nmember of the team, while whirling his partner round in a circle by\r\nher outstretched arms, might let her go and break her neck; and though\r\nconstant disappointment had to some extent blunted the first fine\r\nenthusiasm of his early visits, he still hoped.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the speciality dancers came and went unscathed as\r\nusual, but Lancelot hardly noticed them. His whole attention was\r\nconcentrated on the girl seated across the room immediately opposite\r\nhim. It was beyond a question she.\r\n\r\nWell, you know what poets are. When their emotions are stirred, they\r\nare not like us dull, diffident fellows. They breathe quickly through\r\ntheir noses and get off to a flying start. In one bound Lancelot was\r\nacross the room, his heart beating till it sounded like a by-request\r\nsolo from the trap-drummer.\r\n\r\n'Shall we dance?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Can you dance?' said the girl.\r\n\r\nLancelot gave a short, amused laugh. He had had a good University\r\neducation, and had not failed to profit by it. He was a man who never\r\nlet his left hip know what his right hip was doing.\r\n\r\n'I am old Colonel Charleston's favourite son,' he said, simply.\r\n\r\nA sound like the sudden descent of an iron girder on a sheet of tin,\r\nfollowed by a jangling of bells, a wailing of tortured cats, and the\r\nnoise of a few steam-riveters at work, announced to their trained ears\r\nthat the music had begun. Sweeping her to him with a violence which,\r\nattempted in any other place, would have earned him a sentence of\r\nthirty days coupled with some strong remarks from the Bench, Lancelot\r\nbegan to push her yielding form through the sea of humanity till they\r\nreached the centre of the whirlpool. There, unable to move in any\r\ndirection, they surrendered themselves to the ecstasy of the dance,\r\nwiping their feet on the polished flooring and occasionally pushing an\r\nelbow into some stranger's encroaching rib.\r\n\r\n'This,' murmured the girl with closed eyes, 'is divine.'\r\n\r\n'What?' bellowed Lancelot, for the orchestra, in addition to ringing\r\nbells, had now begun to howl like wolves at dinner-time.\r\n\r\n'Divine,' roared the girl. 'You certainly are a beautiful dancer.'\r\n\r\n'A beautiful what?'\r\n\r\n'Dancer.'\r\n\r\n'Who is?'\r\n\r\n'You are.'\r\n\r\n'Good egg!' shrieked Lancelot, rather wishing, though he was fond of\r\nmusic, that the orchestra would stop beating the floor with hammers.\r\n\r\n'What did you say?'\r\n\r\n'I said, \"Good egg.\"'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Because the idea crossed my mind that, if you felt like that, you\r\nmight care to marry me.'\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden lull in the storm. It was as if the audacity\r\nof his words had stricken the orchestra into a sort of paralysis.\r\nDark-complexioned men who had been exploding bombs and touching off\r\nautomobile hooters became abruptly immobile and sat rolling their\r\neyeballs. One or two people left the floor, and plaster stopped falling\r\nfrom the ceiling.\r\n\r\n'Marry you?' said the girl.\r\n\r\n'I love you as no man has ever loved woman before.'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's always something. What would the name be?'\r\n\r\n'Mulliner. Lancelot Mulliner.'\r\n\r\n'It might be worse.' She looked at him with pensive eyes. 'Well, why\r\nnot?' she said. 'It would be a crime to let a dancer like you go out of\r\nthe family. On the other hand, my father will kick like a mule. Father\r\nis an Earl.'\r\n\r\n'What Earl?'\r\n\r\n'The Earl of Biddlecombe.'\r\n\r\n'Well, earls aren't everything,' said Lancelot with a touch of pique.\r\n'The Mulliners are an old and honourable family. A Sieur de Moulinières\r\ncame over with the Conqueror.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, but did a Sieur de Moulinières ever do down the common people\r\nfor a few hundred thousand and salt it away in gilt-edged securities?\r\nThat's what's going to count with the aged parent. What with taxes\r\nand super-taxes and death duties and falling land-values, there has\r\nof recent years been very, very little of the right stuff in the\r\nBiddlecombe sock. Shake the family money-box and you will hear but the\r\nfaintest rattle. And I ought to tell you that at the Junior Lipstick\r\nClub seven to two is being freely offered on my marrying Slingsby\r\nPurvis, of Purvis's Liquid Dinner Glue. Nothing is definitely decided\r\nyet, but you can take it as coming straight from the stable that,\r\nunless something happens to upset current form, she whom you now see\r\nbefore you is the future Ma Purvis.'\r\n\r\nLancelot stamped his foot defiantly, eliciting a howl of agony from a\r\npassing reveller.\r\n\r\n'This shall not be,' he muttered.\r\n\r\n'If you care to bet against it,' said the girl, producing a small\r\nnotebook, 'I can accommodate you at the current odds.'\r\n\r\n'Purvis, forsooth!'\r\n\r\n'I'm not saying it's a pretty name. All I'm trying to point out is that\r\nat the present moment he heads the \"All the above have arrived\" list.\r\nHe is Our Newmarket Correspondent's Five-Pound Special and Captain\r\nCoe's final selection. What makes you think you can nose him out? Are\r\nyou rich?'\r\n\r\n'At present, only in love. But tomorrow I go to my uncle, who is\r\nimmensely wealthy--'\r\n\r\n'And touch him?'\r\n\r\n'Not quite that. Nobody has touched Uncle Jeremiah since the early\r\nwinter of 1885. But I shall get him to give me a job, and then we shall\r\nsee.'\r\n\r\n'Do,' said the girl, warmly. 'And if you can stick the gaff into Purvis\r\nand work the Young Lochinvar business, I shall be the first to touch\r\noff red fire. On the other hand, it is only fair to inform you that at\r\nthe Junior Lipstick all the girls look on the race as a walk-over. None\r\nof the big punters will touch it.'\r\n\r\nLancelot returned to his rooms that night undiscouraged. He intended\r\nto sink his former prejudices and write a poem in praise of Briggs's\r\nBreakfast Pickles which would mark a new era in commercial verse. This\r\nhe would submit to his uncle; and, having stunned him with it, would\r\nagree to join the firm as chief poetry-writer. He tentatively pencilled\r\ndown five thousand pounds a year as the salary which he would demand.\r\nWith a long-term contract for five thousand a year in his pocket, he\r\ncould approach Lord Biddlecombe and jerk a father's blessing out of him\r\nin no time. It would be humiliating, of course, to lower his genius\r\nby writing poetry about pickles; but a lover must make sacrifices. He\r\nbought a quire of the best foolscap, brewed a quart of the strongest\r\ncoffee, locked his door, disconnected his telephone, and sat down at\r\nhis desk.\r\n\r\nGenial old Jeremiah Briggs received him, when he called next day at his\r\npalatial house, the Villa Chutney, at Putney, with a bluff good-humour\r\nwhich showed that he still had a warm spot in his heart for the young\r\nrascal.\r\n\r\n'Sit down, boy, and have a pickled onion,' said he, cheerily, slapping\r\nLancelot on the shoulder. 'You've come to tell me you've reconsidered\r\nyour idiotic decision about not joining the business, eh? No doubt we\r\nthought it a little beneath our dignity to start at the bottom and work\r\nour way up? But, consider, my dear lad. We must learn to walk before\r\nwe can run, and you could hardly expect me to make you chief cucumber\r\nbuyer, or head of the vinegar-bottling department, before you have\r\nacquired hard-won experience.'\r\n\r\n'If you will allow me to explain, uncle--'\r\n\r\n'Eh?' Mr Briggs's geniality faded somewhat. 'Am I to understand that\r\nyou don't want to come into the business?'\r\n\r\n'Yes and no,' said Lancelot. 'I still consider that slicing up\r\ncucumbers and dipping them in vinegar is a poor life-work for a man\r\nwith the Promethean fire within him; but I propose to place at the\r\ndisposal of the Briggs Breakfast Pickle my poetic gifts.'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's better than nothing. I've just been correcting the proofs\r\nof the last thing our man turned in. It's really excellent. Listen:\r\n\r\n    'Soon, soon all human joys must end:\r\n    Grim Death approaches with his sickle:\r\n    Courage! There is still time, my friend,\r\n    To eat a Briggs's Breakfast Pickle.'\r\n\r\n'If you could give us something like that--'\r\n\r\nLancelot raised his eyebrows. His lip curled.\r\n\r\n'The little thing I have dashed off is not quite like that.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, you've written something, eh?'\r\n\r\n'A mere _morceau_. You would care to hear it?'\r\n\r\n'Fire away, my boy.'\r\n\r\nLancelot produced his manuscript and cleared his throat. He began to\r\nread in a low, musical voice.\r\n\r\n                        'DARKLING (A Threnody)\r\n\r\n                       BY L. BASSINGTON MULLINER\r\n\r\n    (Copyright in all languages, including the Scandinavian)\r\n\r\n    (The dramatic, musical-comedy, and motion-picture rights of this\r\n    Threnody are strictly reserved. Applications for these should be\r\n    made to the author)'\r\n\r\n'What is a Threnody?' asked Mr Briggs.\r\n\r\n'This is,' said Lancelot.\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat again and resumed.\r\n\r\n    'Black branches,\r\n    Like a corpse's withered hands,\r\n    Waving against the blacker sky:\r\n    Chill winds,\r\n    Bitter like the tang of half-remembered sins;\r\n    Bats wheeling mournfully through the air,\r\n    And on the ground\r\n    Worms,\r\n    Toads,\r\n    Frogs,\r\n    And nameless creeping things;\r\n    And all around\r\n    Desolation,\r\n    Doom,\r\n    Dyspepsia,\r\n    And Despair.\r\n    I am a bat that wheels through the air of Fate;\r\n    I am a worm that wriggles in a swamp of Disillusionment;\r\n    I am a despairing toad;\r\n    I have got dyspepsia.'\r\n\r\nHe paused. His uncle's eyes were protruding rather like those of a\r\nnameless creeping frog.\r\n\r\n'What's all this?' said Mr Briggs.\r\n\r\nIt seemed almost incredible to Lancelot that his poem should present\r\nany aspect of obscurity to even the meanest intellect; but he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n'The thing,' he said, 'is symbolic. It essays to depict the state of\r\nmind of the man who has not yet tried Briggs's Breakfast Pickles. I\r\nshall require it to be printed in hand-set type on deep cream-coloured\r\npaper.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?' said Mr Briggs, touching the bell.\r\n\r\n'With bevelled edges. It must be published, of course, bound in limp\r\nleather, preferably of a violet shade, in a limited edition, confined\r\nto one hundred and five copies. Each of these copies I will sign--'\r\n\r\n'You rang, sir?' said the butler, appearing in the doorway.\r\n\r\nMr Briggs nodded curtly.\r\n\r\n'Bewstridge,' said he, 'throw Mr Lancelot out.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And see,' added Mr Briggs, superintending the subsequent proceedings\r\nfrom his library window, 'that he never darkens my doors again. When\r\nyou have finished, Bewstridge, ring up my lawyers on the telephone. I\r\nwish to alter my will.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYouth is a resilient period. With all his worldly prospects swept away\r\nand a large bruise on his person which made it uncomfortable for him\r\nto assume a sitting posture, you might have supposed that the return\r\nof Lancelot Mulliner from Putney would have resembled that of the late\r\nNapoleon from Moscow. Such, however, was not the case. What, Lancelot\r\nasked himself as he rode back to civilization on top of an omnibus, did\r\nmoney matter? Love, true love, was all. He would go to Lord Biddlecombe\r\nand tell him so in a few neatly-chosen words. And his lordship, moved\r\nby his eloquence, would doubtless drop a well-bred tear and at once\r\nsee that the arrangements for his wedding to Angela--for such, he had\r\nlearned, was her name--were hastened along with all possible speed. So\r\nuplifted was he by this picture that he began to sing, and would have\r\ncontinued for the remainder of the journey had not the conductor in a\r\nrather brusque manner ordered him to desist. He was obliged to content\r\nhimself until the bus reached Hyde Park Corner by singing in dumb show.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Biddlecombe's town residence was in Berkeley Square.\r\nLancelot rang the bell and a massive butler appeared.\r\n\r\n'No hawkers, street criers, or circulars,' said the butler.\r\n\r\n'I wish to see Lord Biddlecombe.'\r\n\r\n'Is his lordship expecting you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Lancelot, feeling sure that the girl would have spoken to\r\nher father over the morning toast and marmalade of a possible visit\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nA voice made itself heard through an open door on the left of the long\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n'Fotheringay.'\r\n\r\n'Your lordship?'\r\n\r\n'Is that the feller?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, your lordship.'\r\n\r\n'Then bring him in, Fotheringay.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, your lordship.'\r\n\r\nLancelot found himself in a small, comfortably-furnished room,\r\nconfronting a dignified-looking old man with a patrician nose and small\r\nside-whiskers, who looked like something that long ago had come out of\r\nan egg.\r\n\r\n'Afternoon,' said this individual.\r\n\r\n'Good afternoon, Lord Biddlecombe,' said Lancelot.\r\n\r\n'Now, about these trousers.'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon?'\r\n\r\n'These trousers,' said the other, extending a shapely leg. 'Do they\r\nfit? Aren't they a bit baggy round the ankles? Won't they jeopardize my\r\nsocial prestige if I am seen in them in the Park?'\r\n\r\nLancelot was charmed with his affability. It gave him the feeling of\r\nhaving been made one of the family straight away.\r\n\r\n'You really want my opinion?'\r\n\r\n'I do. I want your candid opinion as a God-fearing man and a member of\r\na West-End tailoring firm.'\r\n\r\n'But I'm not.'\r\n\r\n'Not a God-fearing man?'\r\n\r\n'Not a member of a West-End tailoring firm.'\r\n\r\n'Come, come,' said his lordship, testily. 'You represent Gusset and\r\nMainprice, of Cork Street.'\r\n\r\n'No, I don't.'\r\n\r\n'Then who the devil are you?'\r\n\r\n'My name is Mulliner.'\r\n\r\nLord Biddlecombe rang the bell furiously.\r\n\r\n'Fotheringay!'\r\n\r\n'Your lordship?'\r\n\r\n'You told me this man was the feller I was expecting from Gusset and\r\nMainprice.'\r\n\r\n'He certainly led me to suppose so, your lordship.'\r\n\r\n'Well, he isn't. His name is Mulliner. And--this is the point,\r\nFotheringay. This is the core and centre of the thing--what the blazes\r\ndoes he want?'\r\n\r\n'I could not say, your lordship.'\r\n\r\n'I came here, Lord Biddlecombe,' said Lancelot, 'to ask your consent to\r\nmy immediate marriage with your daughter.'\r\n\r\n'My daughter?'\r\n\r\n'Your daughter.'\r\n\r\n'Which daughter?'\r\n\r\n'Angela.'\r\n\r\n'My daughter Angela?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'You want to marry my daughter Angela?'\r\n\r\n'I do.'\r\n\r\n'Oh? Well, be that as it may,' said Lord Biddlecombe, 'can I interest\r\nyou in an ingenious little combination mousetrap and pencil-sharpener?'\r\n\r\nLancelot was for a moment a little taken aback by the question. Then,\r\nremembering what Angela had said of the state of the family finances,\r\nhe recovered his poise. He thought no worse of this Grecian-beaked\r\nold man for ekeing out a slender income by acting as agent for the\r\ncurious little object which he was now holding out to him. Many of the\r\naristocracy, he was aware, had been forced into similar commercial\r\nenterprises by recent legislation of a harsh and Socialistic trend.\r\n\r\n'I should like it above all things,' he said, courteously. 'I was\r\nthinking only this morning that it was just what I needed.'\r\n\r\n'Highly educational. Not a toy. Fotheringay, book one Mouso-Penso.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, your lordship.'\r\n\r\n'Are you troubled at all with headaches, Mr Mulliner?'\r\n\r\n'Very seldom.'\r\n\r\n'Then what you want is Clark's Cure for Corns. Shall we say one of the\r\nlarge bottles?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly.'\r\n\r\n'Then that--with a year's subscription to _Our Tots_--will come\r\nto precisely one pound, three shillings, and sixpence. Thank you. Will\r\nthere be anything further?'\r\n\r\n'No, thank you. Now, touching the matter of--'\r\n\r\n'You wouldn't care for a scarf-pin? Any ties, collars, shirts? No? Then\r\ngood-bye, Mr Mulliner.'\r\n\r\n'But--'\r\n\r\n'Fotheringay,' said Lord Biddlecombe, 'throw Mr Mulliner out.'\r\n\r\nAs Lancelot scrambled to his feet from the hard pavement of Berkeley\r\nSquare, he was conscious of a rush of violent anger which deprived him\r\nmomentarily of speech. He stood there, glaring at the house from which\r\nhe had been ejected, his face working hideously. So absorbed was he\r\nthat it was some time before he became aware that somebody was plucking\r\nat his coat-sleeve.\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, sir.'\r\n\r\nLancelot looked round. A stout smooth-faced man with horn-rimmed\r\nspectacles was standing beside him.\r\n\r\n'If you could spare me a moment--'\r\n\r\nLancelot shook him off impatiently. He had no desire at a time like\r\nthis to chatter with strangers. The man was babbling something, but the\r\nwords made no impression upon his mind. With a savage scowl, Lancelot\r\nsnatched the fellow's umbrella from him and, poising it for an instant,\r\nflung it with a sure aim through Lord Biddlecombe's study window. Then,\r\nstriding away, he made for Berkeley Street. Glancing over his shoulder\r\nas he turned the corner, he saw that Fotheringay, the butler, had\r\ncome out of the house and was standing over the spectacled man with a\r\ncertain quiet menace in his demeanour. He was rolling up his sleeves,\r\nand his fingers were twitching a little.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLancelot dismissed the man from his thoughts. His whole mind now was\r\nconcentrated on the coming interview with Angela. For he had decided\r\nthat the only thing to do was to seek her out at her club, where she\r\nwould doubtless be spending the afternoon, and plead with her to follow\r\nthe dictates of her heart and, abandoning parents and wealthy suitors,\r\ncome with her true mate to a life of honest poverty sweetened by love\r\nand _vers libre_.\r\n\r\nArriving at the Junior Lipstick, he inquired for her, and the\r\nhall-porter dispatched a boy in buttons to fetch her from the\r\nbilliard-room, where she was refereeing the finals of the Débutantes'\r\nShove-Ha'penny Tournament. And presently his heart leaped as he saw\r\nher coming towards him, looking more like a vision of Springtime than\r\nanything human and earthly. She was smoking a cigarette in a long\r\nholder, and as she approached she inserted a monocle inquiringly in her\r\nright eye.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, laddie!' she said. 'You here? What's on the mind besides hair?\r\nTalk quick. I've only got a minute.'\r\n\r\n'Angela,' said Lancelot, 'I have to report a slight hitch in the\r\nprogramme which I sketched out at our last meeting. I have just been to\r\nsee my uncle and he has washed his hands of me and cut me out of his\r\nwill.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing doing in that quarter, you mean?' said the girl, chewing her\r\nlower lip thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'Nothing. But what of it? What matters it so long as we have each\r\nother? Money is dross. Love is everything. Yes, love indeed is light\r\nfrom heaven, a spark of that immortal fire with angels shared, by\r\nAllah given to lift from earth our low desire. Give me to live with\r\nLove alone, and let the world go dine and dress. If life's a flower,\r\nI choose my own. 'Tis Love in Idleness. When beauty fires the blood,\r\nhow love exalts the mind! Come, Angela, let us read together in a book\r\nmore moving than the Koran, more eloquent than Shakespeare, the book\r\nof books, the crown of all literature--Bradshaw's Railway Guide. We\r\nwill turn up a page and you shall put your finger down, and wherever\r\nit rests there we will go, to live for ever with our happiness. Oh,\r\nAngela, let us--'\r\n\r\n'Sorry,' said the girl. 'Purvis wins. The race goes by the form-book\r\nafter all. There was a time when I thought you might be going to crowd\r\nhim on the rails and get your nose first under the wire with a quick\r\nlast-minute dash, but apparently it is not to be. Deepest sympathy, old\r\ncrocus, but that's that.'\r\n\r\nLancelot staggered.\r\n\r\n'You mean you intend to marry this Purvis?'\r\n\r\n'Pop in about a month from now at St George's, Hanover Square, and see\r\nfor yourself.'\r\n\r\n'You would allow this man to buy you with his gold?'\r\n\r\n'Don't overlook his diamonds.'\r\n\r\n'Does love count for nothing? Surely you love me?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I do, my desert king. When you do that flat-footed Black\r\nBottom step with the sort of wiggly twiggle at the end, I feel as if\r\nI were eating plovers' eggs in a new dress to the accompaniment of\r\nheavenly music.' She sighed. 'Yes, I love you, Lancelot. And women are\r\nnot like men. They do not love lightly. When a woman gives her heart,\r\nit is for ever. The years will pass, and you will turn to another. But\r\nI shall not forget. However, as you haven't a bob in the world--' She\r\nbeckoned to the hall-porter. 'Margerison.'\r\n\r\n'Your ladyship?'\r\n\r\n'Is it raining?'\r\n\r\n'No, your ladyship.'\r\n\r\n'Are the front steps clean?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, your ladyship.'\r\n\r\n'Then throw Mr Mulliner out.'\r\n\r\nLancelot leaned against the railings of the Junior Lipstick, and looked\r\nout through a black mist upon a world that heaved and rocked and seemed\r\non the point of disintegrating into ruin and chaos. And a lot he would\r\ncare, he told himself bitterly, if it did. If Seamore Place from the\r\nwest and Charles Street from the east had taken a running jump and\r\nlanded on the back of his neck, it would have added little or nothing\r\nto the turmoil of his mind. In fact, he would rather have preferred it.\r\n\r\nFury, as it had done on the pavement of Berkeley Square, robbed him of\r\nspeech. But his hands, his shoulders, his brows, his lips, his nose,\r\nand even his eyelashes seemed to be charged with a silent eloquence.\r\nHe twitched his eyebrows in agony. He twiddled his fingers in despair.\r\nNothing was left now, he felt, as he shifted the lobe of his left ear\r\nin a nor'-nor'-easterly direction, but suicide. Yes, he told himself,\r\ntightening and relaxing the muscles of his cheeks, all that remained\r\nnow was death.\r\n\r\nBut, even as he reached this awful decision, a kindly voice spoke in\r\nhis ear.\r\n\r\n'Oh, come now, I wouldn't say that,' said the kindly voice.\r\n\r\nAnd Lancelot, turning, perceived the smooth-faced man who had tried to\r\nengage him in conversation in Berkeley Square.\r\n\r\n'Say, listen,' said the smooth-faced man, sympathy in each lens of his\r\nhorn-rimmed spectacles. 'Tempests may lower and a strong man stand face\r\nto face with his soul, but hope, like a healing herb, will show the\r\nsilver lining where beckons joy and life and happiness.'\r\n\r\nLancelot eyed him haughtily.\r\n\r\n'I am not aware--' he began.\r\n\r\n'Say, listen,' said the other, laying a soothing hand on his shoulder.\r\n'I know just what has happened. Mammon has conquered Cupid, and once\r\nmore youth has had to learn the old, old lesson that though the face be\r\nfair the heart may be cold and callous.'\r\n\r\n'What--?'\r\n\r\nThe smooth-faced man raised his hand.\r\n\r\n'That afternoon. Her apartment. \"No. It can never be. I shall wed a\r\nwealthier wooer.\"'\r\n\r\nLancelot's fury began to dissolve into awe. There seemed something\r\nuncanny in the way this total stranger had diagnosed the situation. He\r\nstared at him, bewildered.\r\n\r\n'How did you know?' he gasped.\r\n\r\n'You told me.'\r\n\r\n'I?'\r\n\r\n'Your face did. I could read every word. I've been watching you for the\r\nlast two minutes, and, say, boy, it was a wow!'\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' asked Lancelot.\r\n\r\nThe smooth-faced man produced from his waistcoat pocket a fountain-pen,\r\ntwo cigars, a packet of chewing-gum, a small button bearing the legend,\r\n'Boost for Hollywood', and a visiting-card--in the order named.\r\nReplacing the other articles, he handed the card to Lancelot.\r\n\r\n'I'm Isadore Zinzinheimer, kid,' he said. 'I represent the Bigger,\r\nBetter, and Brighter Motion-Picture Company of Hollywood, Cal.,\r\nincorporated last July for sixteen hundred million dollars. And if\r\nyou're thinking of asking me what I want, I want you. Yes, sir! Say,\r\nlisten. A fellow that can register the way you can is needed in my\r\nbusiness; and, if you think money can stop me getting him, name\r\nthe biggest salary you can think of and hear me laugh. Boy, I use\r\nbank-notes for summer underclothing, and I don't care how bad you've\r\ngot the gimme's if only you'll sign on the dotted line. Say, listen. A\r\nbozo that with a mere twitch of the upper lip can make it plain to one\r\nand all that he loves a haughty aristocrat and that she has given him\r\nthe air because his rich uncle, who is a pickle manufacturer living\r\nin Putney, won't have anything more to do with him, is required out\r\nat Hollywood by the next boat if the movies are ever to become an\r\neducational force in the truest and deepest sense of the words.'\r\n\r\nLancelot stared at him.\r\n\r\n'You want me to come to Hollywood?'\r\n\r\n'I want you, and I'm going to get you. And if you think you're going to\r\nprevent me, you're trying to stop Niagara with a tennis racket. Boy,\r\nyou're great! When you register, you register. Your face is as chatty\r\nas a board of directors. Say, listen. You know the great thing we folks\r\nin the motion-picture industry have got to contend with? The curse of\r\nthe motion-picture industry is that in every audience there are from\r\nsix to seven young women with adenoids who will insist on reading out\r\nthe titles as they are flashed on the screen, filling the rest of\r\nthe customers with harsh thoughts and dreams of murder. What we're\r\ntrying to collect is stars that can register so well that titles won't\r\nbe needed. And, boy, you're the king of them. I know you're feeling\r\ngood and sore just now because that beazle in there spurned your\r\nhonest love; but forget it. Think of your Art. Think of your Public.\r\nCome now, what shall we say to start with? Five thousand a week? Ten\r\nthousand? You call the shots, and I'll provide the blank contract and\r\nfountain-pen.'\r\n\r\nLancelot needed no further urging. Already love had turned to hate,\r\nand he no longer wished to marry Angela. Instead, he wanted to make\r\nher burn with anguish and vain regrets; and it seemed to him that\r\nFate was pointing the way. Pretty silly the future Lady Angela Purvis\r\nwould feel when she discovered that she had rejected the love of a\r\nman with a salary of ten thousand dollars a week. And fairly foolish\r\nher old father would feel when news reached him of the good thing he\r\nhad allowed to get away. And racking would be the remorse, when he\r\nreturned to London as Civilized Girlhood's Sweetheart and they saw\r\nhim addressing mobs from a hotel balcony, of his Uncle Jeremiah, of\r\nFotheringay, of Bewstridge, and of Margerison.\r\n\r\nA light gleamed in Lancelot's eye, and he rolled the tip of his nose in\r\na circular movement.\r\n\r\n'You consent?' said Mr Zinzinheimer, delighted. ''At-a-boy! Here's the\r\npen and here's the contract.'\r\n\r\n'Gimme!' said Lancelot.\r\n\r\nA benevolent glow irradiated the other's spectacles.\r\n\r\n'Came the Dawn!' he murmured. 'Came the Dawn!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   6\r\n\r\n                         THE STORY OF WILLIAM\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Postlethwaite, our able and vigilant barmaid, had whispered to us\r\nthat the gentleman sitting over there in the corner was an American\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n'Comes from America,' added Miss Postlethwaite, making her meaning\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\n'From America?' echoed we.\r\n\r\n'From America,' said Miss Postlethwaite. 'He's an American.'\r\n\r\nMr Mulliner rose with an old-world grace. We do not often get Americans\r\nin the bar-parlour of the Anglers' Rest. When we do, we welcome them.\r\nWe make them realize that Hands Across the Sea is no mere phrase.\r\n\r\n'Good evening, sir,' said Mr Mulliner. 'I wonder if you would care to\r\njoin my friend and myself in a little refreshment?'\r\n\r\n'Very kind of you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Miss Postlethwaite, the usual. I understand you are from the other\r\nside, sir. Do you find our English country-side pleasant?'\r\n\r\n'Delightful. Though, of course, if I may say so, scarcely to be\r\ncompared with the scenery of my home State.'\r\n\r\n'What State is that?'\r\n\r\n'California,' replied the other, baring his head. 'California, the\r\nJewel State of the Union. With its azure sea, its noble hills, its\r\neternal sunshine, and its fragrant flowers, California stands alone.\r\nPeopled by stalwart men and womanly women....'\r\n\r\n'California would be all right,' said Mr Mulliner, 'if it wasn't for\r\nthe earthquakes.'\r\n\r\nOur guest started as though some venomous snake had bitten him.\r\n\r\n'Earthquakes are absolutely unknown in California,' he said, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n'What about the one in 1906?'\r\n\r\n'That was not an earthquake. It was a fire.'\r\n\r\n'An earthquake, I always understood,' said Mr Mulliner. 'My Uncle\r\nWilliam was out there during it, and many a time has he said to me, \"My\r\nboy, it was the San Francisco earthquake that won me a bride\".'\r\n\r\n'Couldn't have been the earthquake. May have been the fire.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I will tell you the story, and you shall judge for yourself.'\r\n\r\n'I shall be glad to hear your story about the San Francisco fire,' said\r\nthe Californian, courteously.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Uncle William (said Mr Mulliner) was returning from the East at\r\nthe time. The commercial interests of the Mulliners had always been\r\nfar-flung: and he had been over in China looking into the workings of a\r\ntea-exporting business in which he held a number of shares. It was his\r\nintention to get off the boat at San Francisco and cross the continent\r\nby rail. He particularly wanted to see the Grand Canyon of Arizona.\r\nAnd when he found that Myrtle Banks had for years cherished the same\r\ndesire, it seemed to him so plain a proof that they were twin souls\r\nthat he decided to offer her his hand and heart without delay.\r\n\r\nThis Miss Banks had been a fellow-traveller on the boat all the way\r\nfrom Hong Kong; and day by day William Mulliner had fallen more and\r\nmore deeply in love with her. So on the last day of the voyage, as they\r\nwere steaming in at the Golden Gate, he proposed.\r\n\r\nI have never been informed of the exact words which he employed, but no\r\ndoubt they were eloquent. All the Mulliners have been able speakers,\r\nand on such an occasion, he would, of course, have extended himself.\r\nWhen at length he finished, it seemed to him that the girl's attitude\r\nwas distinctly promising. She stood gazing over the rail into the water\r\nbelow in a sort of rapt way. Then she turned.\r\n\r\n'Mr Mulliner,' she said, 'I am greatly flattered and honoured by what\r\nyou have just told me.' These things happened, you will remember, in\r\nthe days when girls talked like that. 'You have paid me the greatest\r\ncompliment a man can bestow on a woman. And yet....'\r\n\r\nWilliam Mulliner's heart stood still. He did not like that 'And yet--'\r\n\r\n'Is there another?' he muttered.\r\n\r\n'Well, yes, there is. Mr Franklyn proposed to me this morning. I told\r\nhim I would think it over.'\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. William was telling himself that he had been\r\nafraid of that bounder Franklyn all along. He might have known, he\r\nfelt, that Desmond Franklyn would be a menace. The man was one of those\r\nlean, keen, hawk-faced, Empire-building sort of chaps you find out\r\nEast--the kind of fellow who stands on deck chewing his moustache with\r\na far-away look in his eyes, and then, when the girl asks him what he\r\nis thinking about, draws a short, quick breath and says he is sorry to\r\nbe so absent-minded, but a sunset like that always reminds him of the\r\nday when he killed the four pirates with his bare hands and saved dear\r\nold Tuppy Smithers in the nick of time.\r\n\r\n'There is a great glamour about Mr Franklyn,' said Myrtle Banks. 'We\r\nwomen admire men who do things. A girl cannot help but respect a man\r\nwho once killed three sharks with a Boy Scout pocket-knife.'\r\n\r\n'So he says,' growled William.\r\n\r\n'He showed me the pocket-knife,' said the girl, simply. 'And on another\r\noccasion he brought down two lions with one shot.'\r\n\r\nWilliam Mulliner's heart was heavy, but he struggled on.\r\n\r\n'Very possibly he may have done these things,' he said, 'but surely\r\nmarriage means more than this. Personally, if I were a girl, I would\r\ngo rather for a certain steadiness and stability of character. To\r\nillustrate what I mean, did you happen to see me win the Egg-and-Spoon\r\nrace at the ship's sports? Now there, it seems to me, in what I might\r\ncall microcosm, was an exhibition of all the qualities a married\r\nman most requires--intense coolness, iron resolution, and a quiet,\r\nunassuming courage. The man who under test conditions has carried an\r\negg once and a half times round a deck in a small spoon is a man who\r\ncan be trusted.'\r\n\r\nShe seemed to waver, but only for a moment.\r\n\r\n'I must think,' she said. 'I must think.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' said William. 'You will let me see something of you at the\r\nhotel, after we have landed?'\r\n\r\n'Of course. And if--I mean to say, whatever happens, I shall always\r\nlook on you as a dear, dear friend.'\r\n\r\n'M'yes,' said William Mulliner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor three days my Uncle William's stay in San Francisco was as pleasant\r\nas could reasonably be expected, considering that Desmond Franklyn was\r\nalso stopping at his and Miss Banks's hotel. He contrived to get the\r\ngirl to himself to quite a satisfactory extent; and they spent many\r\nhappy hours together in the Golden Gate Park and at the Cliff House,\r\nwatching the seals basking on the rocks. But on the evening of the\r\nthird day the blow fell.\r\n\r\n'Mr Mulliner,' said Myrtle Banks, 'I want to tell you something.'\r\n\r\n'Anything,' breathed William tenderly, 'except that you are going to\r\nmarry that perisher Franklyn.'\r\n\r\n'But that is exactly what I was going to tell you, and I must not let\r\nyou call him a perisher, for he is a very brave, intrepid man.'\r\n\r\n'When did you decide on this rash act?' asked William dully.\r\n\r\n'Scarcely an hour ago. We were talking in the garden, and somehow or\r\nother we got on to the subject of rhinoceroses. He then told me how he\r\nhad once been chased up a tree by a rhinoceros in Africa and escaped\r\nby throwing pepper in the brute's eyes. He most fortunately chanced to\r\nbe eating his lunch when the animal arrived, and he had a hard-boiled\r\negg and the pepper-pot in his hands. When I heard this story, like\r\nDesdemona, I loved him for the dangers he had passed, and he loved me\r\nthat I did pity them. The wedding is to be in June.'\r\n\r\nWilliam Mulliner ground his teeth in a sudden access of jealous rage.\r\n\r\n'Personally,' he said, 'I consider that the story you have just related\r\nreveals this man Franklyn in a very dubious--I might almost say\r\nsinister--light. On his own showing, the leading trait in his character\r\nappears to be cruelty to animals. The fellow seems totally incapable\r\nof meeting a shark or a rhinoceros or any other of our dumb friends\r\nwithout instantly going out of his way to inflict bodily injury on it.\r\nThe last thing I would wish is to be indelicate, but I cannot refrain\r\nfrom pointing out that, if your union is blessed, your children will\r\nprobably be the sort of children who kick cats and tie tin cans to\r\ndogs' tails. If you take my advice, you will write the man a little\r\nnote, saying that you are sorry but you have changed your mind.'\r\n\r\nThe girl rose in a marked manner.\r\n\r\n'I do not require your advice, Mr Mulliner,' she said, coldly. 'And I\r\nhave not changed my mind.'\r\n\r\nInstantly William Mulliner was all contrition. There is a certain stage\r\nin the progress of a man's love when he feels like curling up in a ball\r\nand making little bleating noises if the object of his affections so\r\nmuch as looks squiggle-eyed at him; and this stage my Uncle William had\r\nreached. He followed her as she paced proudly away through the hotel\r\nlobby, and stammered incoherent apologies. But Myrtle Banks was adamant.\r\n\r\n'Leave me, Mr Mulliner,' she said, pointing at the revolving door that\r\nled into the street. 'You have maligned a better man than yourself, and\r\nI wish to have nothing more to do with you. Go!'\r\n\r\nWilliam went, as directed. And so great was the confusion of his mind\r\nthat he got stuck in the revolving door and had gone round in it no\r\nfewer than eleven times before the hall-porter came to extricate him.\r\n\r\n'I would have removed you from the machinery earlier, sir,' said the\r\nhall-porter deferentially, having deposited him safely in the street,\r\n'but my bet with my mate in there called for ten laps. I waited till\r\nyou had completed eleven so that there should be no argument.'\r\n\r\nWilliam looked at him dazedly.\r\n\r\n'Hall-porter,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Tell me, hall-porter,' said William, 'suppose the only girl you have\r\never loved had gone and got engaged to another, what would you do?'\r\n\r\nThe hall-porter considered.\r\n\r\n'Let me get this right,' he said. 'The proposition is, if I have\r\nfollowed you correctly, what would I do supposing the Jane on whom I\r\nhad always looked as a steady mamma had handed me the old skimmer and\r\ntold me to take all the air I needed because she had gotten another\r\nsweetie?'\r\n\r\n'Precisely.'\r\n\r\n'Your question is easily answered,' said the hall-porter. 'I would go\r\naround the corner and get me a nice stiff drink at Mike's Place.'\r\n\r\n'A drink?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. A nice stiff one.'\r\n\r\n'At where did you say?'\r\n\r\n'Mike's Place, sir. Just round the corner. You can't miss it.'\r\n\r\nWilliam thanked him and walked away. The man's words had started a new,\r\nand in many ways interesting, train of thought. A drink? And a nice\r\nstiff one? There might be something in it.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mulliner had never tasted alcohol in his life. He had promised\r\nhis late mother that he would not do so until he was either twenty-one\r\nor forty-one--he could never remember which. He was at present\r\ntwenty-nine; but wishing to be on the safe side in case he had got his\r\nfigures wrong, he had remained a teetotaller. But now, as he walked\r\nlistlessly along the street towards the corner, it seemed to him that\r\nhis mother in the special circumstances could not reasonably object if\r\nhe took a slight snort. He raised his eyes to heaven, as though to ask\r\nher if a couple of quick ones might not be permitted; and he fancied\r\nthat a faint, far-off voice whispered, 'Go to it!'\r\n\r\nAnd at this moment he found himself standing outside a brightly-lighted\r\nsaloon.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he hesitated. Then, as a twinge of anguish in the region\r\nof his broken heart reminded him of the necessity for immediate\r\nremedies, he pushed open the swing doors and went in.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature of the cheerful, brightly-lit room in which he\r\nfound himself was a long counter, at which were standing a number of\r\nthe citizenry, each with an elbow on the woodwork and a foot upon the\r\nneat brass rail which ran below. Behind the counter appeared the upper\r\nsection of one of the most benevolent and kindly-looking men that\r\nWilliam had ever seen. He had a large smooth face, and he wore a white\r\ncoat, and he eyed William, as he advanced, with a sort of reverent joy.\r\n\r\n'Is this Mike's Place?' asked William.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' replied the white-coated man.\r\n\r\n'Are you Mike?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir. But I am his representative, and have full authority to act\r\non his behalf. What can I have the pleasure of doing for you?'\r\n\r\nThe man's whole attitude made him seem so like a large-hearted elder\r\nbrother that William felt no diffidence about confiding in him. He\r\nplaced an elbow on the counter and a foot on the rail, and spoke with a\r\nsob in his voice.\r\n\r\n'Suppose the only girl you had ever loved had gone and got engaged to\r\nanother, what in your view would best meet the case?'\r\n\r\nThe gentlemanly bar-tender pondered for some moments.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he replied at length, 'I advance it, you understand, as a\r\npurely personal opinion, and I shall not be in the least offended\r\nif you decide not to act upon it; but my suggestion--for what it is\r\nworth--is that you try a Dynamite Dew-Drop.'\r\n\r\nOne of the crowd that had gathered sympathetically round shook his\r\nhead. He was a charming man with a black eye, who had shaved on the\r\npreceding Thursday.\r\n\r\n'Much better give him a Dreamland Special.'\r\n\r\nA second man, in a sweater and a cloth cap, had yet another theory.\r\n\r\n'You can't beat an Undertaker's Joy.'\r\n\r\nThey were all so perfectly delightful and appeared to have his\r\ninterests so unselfishly at heart that William could not bring himself\r\nto choose between them. He solved the problem in diplomatic fashion\r\nby playing no favourites and ordering all three of the beverages\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nThe effect was instantaneous and gratifying. As he drained the first\r\nglass, it seemed to him that a torchlight procession, of whose\r\nexistence he had hitherto not been aware, had begun to march down his\r\nthroat and explore the recesses of his stomach. The second glass,\r\nthough slightly too heavily charged with molten lava, was extremely\r\npalatable. It helped the torchlight procession along by adding to it a\r\nbrass band of singular power and sweetness of tone. And with the third\r\nsomebody began to touch off fireworks inside his head.\r\n\r\nWilliam felt better--not only spiritually but physically. He seemed to\r\nhimself to be a bigger, finer man, and the loss of Myrtle Banks had\r\nsomehow in a flash lost nearly all its importance. After all, as he\r\nsaid to the man with the black eye, Myrtle Banks wasn't everybody.\r\n\r\n'Now what do you recommend?' he asked the man with the sweater, having\r\nturned the last glass upside down.\r\n\r\nThe other mused, one forefinger thoughtfully pressed against the side\r\nof his face.\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll tell you,' he said. 'When my brother Elmer lost his girl,\r\nhe drank straight rye. Yes, sir. That's what he drank--straight rye.\r\n\"I've lost my girl,\" he said, \"and I'm going to drink straight rye.\"\r\nThat's what he said. Yes, sir, straight rye.'\r\n\r\n'And was your brother Elmer,' asked William, anxiously, 'a man whose\r\nexample in your opinion should be followed? Was he a man you could\r\ntrust?'\r\n\r\n'He owned the biggest duck-farm in the southern half of Illinois.'\r\n\r\n'That settles it,' said William. 'What was good enough for a duck who\r\nowned half Illinois is good enough for me. Oblige me,' he said to the\r\ngentlemanly bar-tender, 'by asking these gentlemen what they will have,\r\nand start pouring.'\r\n\r\nThe bar-tender obeyed, and William, having tried a pint or two of\r\nthe strange liquid just to see if he liked it, found that he did,\r\nand ordered some. He then began to move about among his new friends,\r\npatting one on the shoulder, slapping another affably on the back, and\r\nasking a third what his Christian name was.\r\n\r\n'I want you all,' he said, climbing on to the counter so that his voice\r\nshould carry better, 'to come and stay with me in England. Never in my\r\nlife have I met men whose faces I liked so much. More like brothers\r\nthan anything is the way I regard you. So just you pack up a few things\r\nand come along and put up at my little place for as long as you can\r\nmanage. You particularly, my dear old chap,' he added, beaming at the\r\nman in the sweater.\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said the man with the sweater.\r\n\r\n'What did you say?' said William.\r\n\r\n'I said, \"Thanks\".'\r\n\r\nWilliam slowly removed his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeves.\r\n\r\n'I call you gentlemen to witness,' he said, quietly, 'that I have been\r\ngrossly insulted by this gentleman who has just grossly insulted me. I\r\nam not a quarrelsome man, but if anybody wants a row they can have it.\r\nAnd when it comes to being cursed and sworn at by an ugly bounder in a\r\nsweater and a cloth cap, it is time to take steps.'\r\n\r\nAnd with these spirited words William Mulliner sprang from the counter,\r\ngrasped the other by the throat, and bit him sharply on the right\r\near. There was a confused interval, during which somebody attached\r\nhimself to the collar of William's waistcoat and the seat of William's\r\ntrousers, and then a sense of swift movement and rush of cool air.\r\n\r\nWilliam discovered that he was seated on the pavement outside the\r\nsaloon. A hand emerged from the swing door and threw his hat out. And\r\nhe was alone with the night and his meditations.\r\n\r\nThese were, as you may suppose, of a singularly bitter nature. Sorrow\r\nand disillusionment racked William Mulliner like a physical pain.\r\nThat his friends inside there, in spite of the fact that he had been\r\nall sweetness and light and had not done a thing to them, should have\r\nthrown him out into the hard street was the saddest thing he had ever\r\nheard of; and for some minutes he sat there, weeping silently.\r\n\r\nPresently he heaved himself to his feet and, placing one foot with\r\ninfinite delicacy in front of the other, and then drawing the other one\r\nup and placing it with infinite delicacy in front of that, he began to\r\nwalk back to his hotel.\r\n\r\nAt the corner he paused. There were some railings on his right. He clung\r\nto them and rested awhile.\r\n\r\nThe railings to which William Mulliner had attached himself belonged\r\nto a brown-stone house of the kind that seems destined from the\r\nfirst moment of its building to receive guests, both resident and\r\ntransient, at a moderate weekly rental. It was, in fact, as he would\r\nhave discovered had he been clear-sighted enough to read the card over\r\nthe door, Mrs Beulah O'Brien's Theatrical Boarding-House ('A Home From\r\nHome--No Cheques Cashed--This Means You').\r\n\r\nBut William was not in the best of shape for reading cards. A sort of\r\nmist had obscured the world, and he was finding it difficult to keep\r\nhis eyes open. And presently, his chin wedged into the railings, he\r\nfell into a dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by light flashing in his eyes; and, opening them,\r\nsaw that a window opposite where he was standing had become brightly\r\nilluminated. His slumbers had cleared his vision; and he was able to\r\nobserve that the room into which he was looking was a dining-room. The\r\nlong table was set for the evening meal; and to William, as he gazed,\r\nthe sight of that cosy apartment, with the gaslight falling on the\r\nknives and forks and spoons, seemed the most pathetic and poignant that\r\nhe had ever beheld.\r\n\r\nA mood of the most extreme sentimentality now had him in its grip. The\r\nthought that he would never own a little home like that racked him from\r\nstem to stern with an almost unbearable torment. What, argued William,\r\nclinging to the railings and crying weakly, could compare, when you\r\ncame right down to it, with a little home? A man with a little home is\r\nall right, whereas a man without a little home is just a bit of flotsam\r\non the ocean of life. If Myrtle Banks had only consented to marry him,\r\nhe would have had a little home. But she had refused to marry him,\r\nso he would never have a little home. What Myrtle Banks wanted, felt\r\nWilliam, was a good swift clout on the side of the head.\r\n\r\nThe thought pleased him. He was feeling physically perfect again now,\r\nand seemed to have shaken off completely the slight indisposition from\r\nwhich he had been suffering. His legs had lost their tendency to act\r\nindependently of the rest of his body. His head felt clearer, and he\r\nhad a sense of overwhelming strength. If ever, in short, there was a\r\nmoment when he could administer that clout on the side of the head to\r\nMyrtle Banks as it should be administered, that moment was now.\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of moving off to find her and teach her what it\r\nmeant to stop a man like himself from having a little home, when\r\nsomeone entered the room into which he was looking, and he paused to\r\nmake further inspection.\r\n\r\nThe new arrival was a coloured maid-servant. She staggered to the\r\nhead of the table beneath the weight of a large tureen containing,\r\nso William suspected, hash. A moment later a stout woman with bright\r\ngolden hair came in and sat down opposite the tureen.\r\n\r\nThe instinct to watch other people eat is one of the most deeply\r\nimplanted in the human bosom, and William lingered, intent. There was,\r\nhe told himself, no need to hurry. He knew which was Myrtle's room in\r\nthe hotel. It was just across the corridor from his own. He could pop\r\nin any time, during the night, and give her that clout. Meanwhile, he\r\nwanted to watch these people eat hash.\r\n\r\nAnd then the door opened again, and there filed into the room a little\r\nprocession. And William, clutching the railings, watched it with\r\nbulging eyes.\r\n\r\nThe procession was headed by an elderly man in a check suit with a\r\ncarnation in his buttonhole. He was about three feet six in height,\r\nthough the military jauntiness with which he carried himself made him\r\nseem fully three feet seven. He was followed by a younger man who wore\r\nspectacles and whose height was perhaps three feet four. And behind\r\nthese two came, in single file, six others, scaling down by degrees\r\nuntil, bringing up the rear of the procession, there entered a rather\r\nstout man in tweeds and bedroom slippers who could not have measured\r\nmore than two feet eight.\r\n\r\nThey took their places at the table. Hash was distributed to all. And\r\nthe man in tweeds, having inspected his plate with obvious relish,\r\nremoved his slippers and, picking up his knife and fork with his toes,\r\nfell to with a keen appetite.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mulliner uttered a soft moan, and tottered away.\r\n\r\nIt was a black moment for my Uncle William. Only an instant before he\r\nhad been congratulating himself on having shaken off the effects of his\r\nfirst indulgence in alcohol after an abstinence of twenty-nine years;\r\nbut now he perceived that he was still intoxicated.\r\n\r\nIntoxicated? The word did not express it by a mile. He was oiled,\r\nboiled, fried, plastered, whiffled, sozzled, and blotto. Only by the\r\nexercise of the most consummate caution and address could he hope to\r\nget back to his hotel and reach his bedroom without causing an open\r\nscandal.\r\n\r\nOf course, if his walk that night had taken him a few yards farther\r\ndown the street than the door of Mike's Place, he would have seen that\r\nthere was a very simple explanation of the spectacle which he had\r\njust witnessed. A walk so extended would have brought him to the San\r\nFrancisco Palace of Varieties, outside which large posters proclaimed\r\nthe exclusive engagement for two weeks of\r\n\r\n                           MURPHY'S MIDGETS\r\n                      BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER\r\n\r\nBut of the existence of these posters he was not aware; and it is not\r\ntoo much to say that the iron entered into William Mulliner's soul.\r\n\r\nThat his legs should have become temporarily unscrewed at the joints\r\nwas a phenomenon which he had been able to bear with fortitude. That\r\nhis head should be feeling as if a good many bees had decided to use\r\nit as a hive was unpleasant, but not unbearably so. But that his brain\r\nshould have gone off its castors and be causing him to see visions was\r\nthe end of all things.\r\n\r\nWilliam had always prided himself on the keenness of his mental powers.\r\nAll through the long voyage on the ship, when Desmond Franklyn had\r\nrelated anecdotes illustrative of his prowess as a man of Action,\r\nWilliam Mulliner had always consoled himself by feeling that in the\r\nmatter of brain he could give Franklyn three bisques and a beating\r\nany time he chose to start. And now, it seemed, he had lost even this\r\nadvantage over his rival. For Franklyn, dull-witted clod though he\r\nmight be, was not such an absolute minus quantity that he would imagine\r\nhe had seen a man of two feet eight cutting up hash with his toes. That\r\nhideous depth of mental decay had been reserved for William Mulliner.\r\n\r\nMoodily he made his way back to his hotel. In a corner of the Palm Room\r\nhe saw Myrtle Banks deep in conversation with Franklyn, but all desire\r\nto give her a clout on the side of the head had now left him. With his\r\nchin sunk on his breast, he entered the elevator and was carried up to\r\nhis room.\r\n\r\nHere as rapidly as his quivering fingers would permit, he undressed;\r\nand, climbing into the bed as it came round for the second time, lay\r\nfor a space with wide-open eyes. He had been too shaken to switch his\r\nlight off, and the rays of the lamp shone on the handsome ceiling which\r\nundulated above him. He gave himself up to thought once more.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, he felt, thinking it over now, his mother had had some very\r\nurgent reason for withholding him from alcoholic drink. She must\r\nhave known of some family secret, sedulously guarded from his infant\r\nears--some dark tale of a fatal Mulliner taint. 'William must never\r\nlearn of this!' she had probably said when they told her the old legend\r\nof how every Mulliner for centuries back had died a maniac, victim at\r\nlast to the fatal fluid. And tonight, despite her gentle care, he had\r\nfound out for himself.\r\n\r\nHe saw now that this derangement of his eyesight was only the first\r\nstep in the gradual dissolution which was the Mulliner Curse. Soon his\r\nsense of hearing would go, then his sense of touch.\r\n\r\nHe sat up in bed. It seemed to him that, as he gazed at the ceiling, a\r\nconsiderable section of it had parted from the parent body and fallen\r\nwith a crash to the floor.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mulliner stared dumbly. He knew, of course, that it was an\r\nillusion. But what a perfect illusion! If he had not had the special\r\nknowledge which he possessed, he would have stated without fear of\r\ncontradiction that there was a gap six feet wide above him and a mass\r\nof dust and plaster on the carpet below.\r\n\r\nAnd even as his eyes deceived him, so did his ears. He seemed to be\r\nconscious of a babel of screams and shouts. The corridor, he could have\r\nsworn, was full of flying feet. The world appeared to be all bangs and\r\ncrashes and thuds. A cold fear gripped at William's heart. His sense of\r\nhearing was playing tricks with him already.\r\n\r\nHis whole being recoiled from making the final experiment, but he\r\nforced himself out of bed. He reached a finger towards the nearest heap\r\nof plaster and drew it back with a groan. Yes, it was as he feared, his\r\nsense of touch had gone wrong too. That heap of plaster, though purely\r\na figment of his disordered brain, had felt solid.\r\n\r\nSo there it was. One little moderately festive evening at Mike's Place,\r\nand the Curse of the Mulliners had got him. Within an hour of absorbing\r\nthe first drink of his life, it had deprived him of his sight, his\r\nhearing, and his sense of touch. Quick service, felt William Mulliner.\r\n\r\nAs he climbed back into bed, it appeared to him that two of the walls\r\nfell out. He shut his eyes, and presently sleep, which has been well\r\ncalled Tired Nature's Sweet Restorer, brought oblivion. His last waking\r\nthought was that he imagined he had heard another wall go.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mulliner was a sound sleeper, and it was many hours before\r\nconsciousness returned to him. When he awoke, he looked about him in\r\nastonishment. The haunting horror of the night had passed; and now,\r\nthough conscious of a rather severe headache, he knew that he was\r\nseeing things as they were.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it seemed odd to think that what he beheld was not the remains\r\nof some nightmare. Not only was the world slightly yellow and a bit\r\nblurred about the edges, but it had changed in its very essentials\r\novernight. Where eight hours before there had been a wall, only an open\r\nspace appeared, with bright sunlight streaming through it. The ceiling\r\nwas on the floor, and almost the only thing remaining of what had been\r\nan expensive bedroom in a first-class hotel was the bed. Very strange,\r\nhe thought, and very irregular.\r\n\r\nA voice broke in upon his meditations.\r\n\r\n'Why, Mr Mulliner!'\r\n\r\nWilliam turned, and being, like all the Mulliners, the soul of modesty,\r\ndived abruptly beneath the bed-clothes. For the voice was the voice of\r\nMyrtle Banks. And she was in his room!\r\n\r\n'Mr Mulliner!'\r\n\r\nWilliam poked his head out cautiously. And then he perceived that\r\nthe proprieties had not been outraged as he had imagined. Miss Banks\r\nwas not in his room, but in the corridor. The intervening wall had\r\ndisappeared. Shaken, but relieved, he sat up in bed, the sheet drawn\r\nround his shoulders.\r\n\r\n'You don't mean to say you're still in bed?' gasped the girl.\r\n\r\n'Why, is it awfully late?' said William.\r\n\r\n'Did you actually stay up here all through it?'\r\n\r\n'Through what?'\r\n\r\n'The earthquake.'\r\n\r\n'What earthquake?'\r\n\r\n'The earthquake last night.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that earthquake?' said William, carelessly. 'I did notice some\r\nsort of an earthquake. I remember seeing the ceiling come down and\r\nsaying to myself, \"I shouldn't wonder if that wasn't an earthquake.\"\r\nAnd then the walls fell out, and I said, \"Yes, I believe it _is_\r\nan earthquake.\" And then I turned over and went to sleep.'\r\n\r\nMyrtle Banks was staring at him with eyes that reminded him partly of\r\ntwin stars and partly of a snail's.\r\n\r\n'You must be the bravest man in the world!'\r\n\r\nWilliam gave a curt laugh.\r\n\r\n'Oh, well,' he said, 'I may not spend my whole life persecuting\r\nunfortunate sharks with pocket-knives, but I find I generally manage\r\nto keep my head fairly well in a crisis. We Mulliners are like that. We\r\ndo not say much, but we have the right stuff in us.'\r\n\r\nHe clutched his head. A sharp spasm had reminded him how much of the\r\nright stuff he had in him at that moment.\r\n\r\n'My hero!' breathed the girl, almost inaudibly.\r\n\r\n'And how is your fiancé this bright, sunny morning?' asked William,\r\nnonchalantly. It was torture to refer to the man, but he must show her\r\nthat a Mulliner knew how to take his medicine.\r\n\r\nShe gave a little shudder.\r\n\r\n'I have no fiancé,' she said.\r\n\r\n'But I thought you told me you and Franklyn....'\r\n\r\n'I am no longer engaged to Mr Franklyn. Last night, when the earthquake\r\nstarted, I cried to him to help me; and he with a hasty \"Some other\r\ntime!\" over his shoulder, disappeared into the open like something shot\r\nout of a gun. I never saw a man run so fast. This morning I broke off\r\nthe engagement.' She uttered a scornful laugh.\r\n\r\n'Sharks and pocket-knives! I don't believe he ever killed a shark in\r\nhis life.'\r\n\r\n'And even if he did,' said William, 'what of it? I mean to say, how\r\ninfrequently in married life must the necessity for killing sharks\r\nwith pocket-knives arise! What a husband needs is not some purely\r\nadventitious gift like that--a parlour trick, you might almost call\r\nit--but a steady character, a warm and generous disposition, and a\r\nloving heart.'\r\n\r\n'How true!' she murmured, dreamily.\r\n\r\n'Myrtle,' said William, 'I would be a husband like that. The steady\r\ncharacter, the warm and generous disposition, and the loving heart to\r\nwhich I have alluded are at your disposal. Will you accept them?'\r\n\r\n'I will,' said Myrtle Banks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd that (concluded Mr Mulliner) is the story of my Uncle William's\r\nromance. And you will readily understand, having heard it, how his\r\neldest son, my cousin, J. S. F. E. Mulliner, got his name.\r\n\r\n'J. S. F. E.?' I said.\r\n\r\n'John San Francisco Earthquake Mulliner,' explained my friend.\r\n\r\n'There never was a San Francisco earthquake,' said the Californian.\r\n'Only a fire.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   7\r\n\r\n                     PORTRAIT OF A DISCIPLINARIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with something of the relief of fog-bound city-dwellers who at\r\nlast behold the sun that we perceived, on entering the bar-parlour\r\nof the Anglers' Rest, that Mr Mulliner was seated once more in the\r\nfamiliar chair. For some days he had been away, paying a visit to an\r\nold nurse of his down in Devonshire: and there was no doubt that in his\r\nabsence the tide of intellectual conversation had run very low.\r\n\r\n'No,' said Mr Mulliner, in answer to a question as to whether he had\r\nenjoyed himself, 'I cannot pretend that it was an altogether agreeable\r\nexperience. I was conscious throughout of a sense of strain. The poor\r\nold thing is almost completely deaf, and her memory is not what it was.\r\nMoreover, it is a moot point whether a man of sensibility can ever be\r\nentirely at his ease in the presence of a woman who has frequently\r\nspanked him with the flat side of a hair-brush.'\r\n\r\nMr Mulliner winced slightly, as if the old wound still troubled him.\r\n\r\n'It is curious,' he went on, after a thoughtful pause, 'how little\r\nchange the years bring about in the attitude of a real, genuine,\r\ncrusted old family nurse towards one who in the early knickerbocker\r\nstage of his career has been a charge of hers. He may grow grey or bald\r\nand be looked up to by the rest of his world as a warm performer on the\r\nStock Exchange or a devil of a fellow in the sphere of Politics or the\r\nArts, but to his old Nanna he will still be the Master James or Master\r\nPercival who had to be hounded by threats to keep his face clean.\r\nShakespeare would have cringed before his old nurse. So would Herbert\r\nSpencer, Attila the Hun, and the Emperor Nero. My nephew Frederick ...\r\nbut I must not bore you with my family gossip.'\r\n\r\nWe reassured him.\r\n\r\n'Oh well, if you wish to hear the story. There is nothing much in it as\r\na story, but it bears out the truth of what I have just been saying.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will begin (said Mr Mulliner) at the moment when Frederick, having\r\ncome down from London in response to an urgent summons from his\r\nbrother, Dr George Mulliner, stood in the latter's consulting-room,\r\nlooking out upon the Esplanade of that quiet little watering-place,\r\nBingley-on-Sea.\r\n\r\nGeorge's consulting-room, facing west, had the advantage of getting\r\nthe afternoon sun: and this afternoon it needed all the sun it could\r\nget, to counteract Frederick's extraordinary gloom. The young man's\r\nexpression, as he confronted his brother, was that which a miasmic pool\r\nin some dismal swamp in the Bad Lands might have worn if it had had a\r\nface.\r\n\r\n'Then the position, as I see it,' he said in a low, toneless voice, 'is\r\nthis. On the pretext of wishing to discuss urgent business with me,\r\nyou have dragged me down to this foul spot--seventy miles by rail in a\r\ncompartment containing three distinct infants sucking sweets--merely to\r\nhave tea with a nurse whom I have disliked since I was a child.'\r\n\r\n'You have contributed to her support for many years,' George reminded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Naturally, when the family were clubbing together to pension off\r\nthe old blister, I chipped in with my little bit,' said Frederick.\r\n'Noblesse oblige.'\r\n\r\n'Well, noblesse obliges you to go and have tea with her when she\r\ninvites you. Wilks must be humoured. She is not so young as she was.'\r\n\r\n'She must be a hundred.'\r\n\r\n'Eighty-five.'\r\n\r\n'Good heavens! And it seems only yesterday that she shut me up in a\r\ncupboard for stealing jam.'\r\n\r\n'She was a great disciplinarian,' agreed George. 'You may find her a\r\nlittle on the autocratic side still. And I want to impress upon you, as\r\nher medical man, that you must not thwart her lightest whim. She will\r\nprobably offer you boiled eggs and home-made cake. Eat them.'\r\n\r\n'I will not eat boiled eggs at five o'clock in the afternoon,' said\r\nFrederick, with a strong man's menacing calm, 'for any woman on earth.'\r\n\r\n'You will. And with relish. Her heart is weak. If you don't humour her,\r\nI won't answer for the consequences.'\r\n\r\n'If I eat boiled eggs at five in the afternoon, I won't answer for the\r\nconsequences. And why boiled eggs, dash it? I'm not a schoolboy.'\r\n\r\n'To her you are. She looks on all of us as children still. Last\r\nChristmas she gave me a copy of _Eric, or Little by Little_.'\r\n\r\nFrederick turned to the window, and scowled down upon the noxious and\r\ndepressing scene below. Sparing neither age nor sex in his detestation,\r\nhe regarded the old ladies reading their library novels on the seats\r\nwith precisely the same dislike and contempt which he bestowed on the\r\nboys' school clattering past on its way to the bathing-houses.\r\n\r\n'Then, checking up your statements,' he said, 'I find that I am\r\nexpected to go to tea with a woman who, in addition, apparently, to\r\nbeing a blend of Lucretia Borgia and a Prussian sergeant-major, is a\r\nphysical wreck and practically potty. Why? That is what I ask. Why? As\r\na child, I objected strongly to Nurse Wilks: and now, grown to riper\r\nyears, the thought of meeting her again gives me the heeby-jeebies. Why\r\nshould I be victimized? Why me particularly?'\r\n\r\n'It isn't you particularly. We've all been to see her at intervals, and\r\nso have the Oliphants.'\r\n\r\n'The Oliphants!'\r\n\r\nThe name seemed to affect Frederick oddly. He winced, as if his brother\r\nhad been a dentist instead of a general practitioner and had just drawn\r\none of his back teeth.\r\n\r\n'She was their nurse after she left us. You can't have forgotten the\r\nOliphants. I remember you at the age of twelve climbing that old elm at\r\nthe bottom of the paddock to get Jane Oliphant a rook's egg.'\r\n\r\nFrederick laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n'I must have been a perfect ass. Fancy risking my life for a girl like\r\nthat! Not,' he went on, 'that life's worth much. An absolute wash-out,\r\nthat's what life is. However, it will soon be over. And then the\r\nsilence and peace of the grave. That,' said Frederick, 'is the thought\r\nthat sustains me.'\r\n\r\n'A pretty kid, Jane. Someone told me she had grown up quite a beauty.'\r\n\r\n'Without a heart.'\r\n\r\n'What do you know about it?'\r\n\r\n'Merely this. She pretended to love me, and then a few months ago she\r\nwent off to the country to stay with some people named Ponderby and\r\nwrote me a letter breaking off the engagement. She gave no reasons,\r\nand I have not seen her since. She is now engaged to a man named\r\nDillingwater, and I hope it chokes her.'\r\n\r\n'I never heard about this. I'm sorry.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not. Merciful release is the way I look at it.'\r\n\r\n'Would he be one of the Sussex Dillingwaters?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know what county the family infests. If I did, I would avoid\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm sorry. No wonder you're depressed.'\r\n\r\n'Depressed?' said Frederick, outraged. 'Me? You don't suppose I'm\r\nworrying myself about a girl like that, do you? I've never been so\r\nhappy in my life. I'm just bubbling over with cheerfulness.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, is that what it is?' George looked at his watch. 'Well, you'd\r\nbetter be pushing along. It'll take you about ten minutes to get to\r\nMarazion Road.'\r\n\r\n'How do I find the blasted house?'\r\n\r\n'The name's on the door.'\r\n\r\n'What is the name?'\r\n\r\n'Wee Holme.'\r\n\r\n'My God!' said Frederick Mulliner. 'It only needed that!'\r\n\r\nThe view which he had had of it from his brother's window should,\r\nno doubt, have prepared Frederick for the hideous loathsomeness of\r\nBingley-on-Sea: but, as he walked along, he found it coming on him as\r\na complete surprise. Until now he had never imagined that a small town\r\ncould possess so many soul-searing features. He passed little boys,\r\nand thought how repulsive little boys were. He met tradesmen's carts,\r\nand his gorge rose at the sight of them. He hated the houses. And,\r\nmost of all, he objected to the sun. It shone down with a cheeriness\r\nwhich was not only offensive but, it seemed to Frederick Mulliner,\r\ndeliberately offensive. What he wanted was wailing winds and driving\r\nrain: not a beastly expanse of vivid blue. It was not that the perfidy\r\nof Jane Oliphant had affected him in any way: it was simply that he\r\ndisliked blue skies and sunshine. He had a temperamental antipathy for\r\nthem, just as he had a temperamental fondness for tombs and sleet and\r\nhurricanes and earthquakes and famines and pestilences and....\r\n\r\nHe found that he had arrived in Marazion Road.\r\n\r\nMarazion Road was made up of two spotless pavements stretching into\r\nthe middle distance and flanked by two rows of neat little red-brick\r\nvillas. It smote Frederick like a blow. He felt as he looked at those\r\nhouses, with their little brass knockers and little white curtains,\r\nthat they were occupied by people who knew nothing of Frederick\r\nMulliner and were content to know nothing; people who were simply not\r\ncaring a whoop that only a few short months before the girl to whom\r\nhe had been engaged had sent back his letters and gone and madly got\r\nherself betrothed to a man named Dillingwater.\r\n\r\nHe found Wee Holme, and hit it a nasty slap with its knocker. Footsteps\r\nsounded in the passage, and the door opened.\r\n\r\n'Why, Master Frederick!' said Nurse Wilks. 'I should hardly have known\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nFrederick, in spite of the natural gloom caused by the blue sky and\r\nthe warm sunshine, found his mood lightening somewhat. Something that\r\nmight almost have been a spasm of tenderness passed through him. He was\r\nnot a bad-hearted young man--he ranked in that respect, he supposed,\r\nsomewhere mid-way between his brother George, who had a heart of gold,\r\nand people like the future Mrs Dillingwater, who had no heart at\r\nall--and there was a fragility about Nurse Wilks that first astonished\r\nand then touched him.\r\n\r\nThe images which we form in childhood are slow to fade: and Frederick\r\nhad been under the impression that Nurse Wilks was fully six feet tall,\r\nwith the shoulders of a weight-lifter and eyes that glittered cruelly\r\nbeneath beetling brows. What he saw now was a little old woman with a\r\nwrinkled face, who looked as if a puff of wind would blow her away.\r\n\r\nHe was oddly stirred. He felt large and protective. He saw his\r\nbrother's point now. Most certainly this frail old thing must be\r\nhumoured. Only a brute would refuse to humour her--yes, felt Frederick\r\nMulliner, even if it meant boiled eggs at five o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n'Well, you are getting a big boy!' said Nurse Wilks, beaming.\r\n\r\n'Do you think so?' said Frederick, with equal amiability.\r\n\r\n'Quite the little man! And all dressed up. Go into the parlour, dear,\r\nand sit down. I'm getting the tea.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks.'\r\n\r\n'WIPE YOUR BOOTS!'\r\n\r\nThe voice, thundering from a quarter whence hitherto only soft cooings\r\nhad proceeded, affected Frederick Mulliner a little like the touching\r\noff of a mine beneath his feet. Spinning round he perceived a different\r\nperson altogether from the mild and kindly hostess of a moment back. It\r\nwas plain that there yet lingered in Nurse Wilks not a little of the\r\nancient fire. Her mouth was tightly compressed and her eyes gleamed\r\ndangerously.\r\n\r\n'Theideaofyourbringingyournastydirtybootsintomynicecleanhousewithoutwipingthem!'\r\nsaid Nurse Wilks.\r\n\r\n'Sorry!' said Frederick humbly.\r\n\r\nHe burnished the criticized shoes on the mat, and tottered to the\r\nparlour. He felt much smaller, much younger, and much feebler than he\r\nhad felt a minute ago. His morale had been shattered into fragments.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not pieced together by the sight, as he entered the parlour,\r\nof Miss Jane Oliphant sitting in an arm-chair by the window.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be supposed that the reader will be interested in the\r\nappearance of a girl of the stamp of Jane Oliphant--a girl capable\r\nof wantonly returning a good man's letters and going off and getting\r\nengaged to a Dillingwater: but one may as well describe her and get\r\nit over. She had golden-brown hair; golden-brown eyes; golden-brown\r\neyebrows; a nice nose with one freckle on the tip; a mouth which, when\r\nit parted in a smile, disclosed pretty teeth; and a resolute little\r\nchin.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, the mouth was not parted in a smile. It was\r\nclosed up tight, and the chin was more than resolute. It looked like\r\nthe ram of a very small battleship. She gazed at Frederick as if he\r\nwere the smell of onions, and she did not say a word.\r\n\r\nNor did Frederick say very much. Nothing is more difficult for a\r\nyoung man than to find exactly the right remark with which to open\r\nconversation with a girl who has recently returned his letters. (Darned\r\ngood letters, too. Reading them over after opening the package, he had\r\nbeen amazed at their charm and eloquence.)\r\n\r\nFrederick, then, confined his observations to the single word 'Guk!'\r\nHaving uttered this, he sank into a chair and stared at the carpet. The\r\ngirl stared out of the window: and complete silence reigned in the room\r\ntill from the interior of a clock which was ticking on the mantelpiece\r\na small wooden bird suddenly emerged, said 'Cuckoo', and withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe abruptness of this bird's appearance and the oddly staccato nature\r\nof its diction could not but have their effect on a man whose nerves\r\nwere not what they had been. Frederick Mulliner, rising some eighteen\r\ninches from his chair, uttered a hasty exclamation.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon?' said Jane Oliphant, raising her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n'Well, how was I to know it was going to do that?' said Frederick\r\ndefensively.\r\n\r\nJane Oliphant shrugged her shoulders. The gesture seemed to imply\r\nsupreme indifference to what the sweepings of the Underworld knew or\r\ndid not know.\r\n\r\nBut Frederick, the ice being now in a manner broken, refused to return\r\nto the silence.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing here?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I have come to have tea with Nanna.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't know you were going to be here.'\r\n\r\n'Oh?'\r\n\r\n'If I'd known that you were going to be here....'\r\n\r\n'You've got a large smut on your nose.'\r\n\r\nFrederick gritted his teeth and reached for his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps I'd better go,' he said.\r\n\r\n'You will do nothing of the kind,' said Miss Oliphant sharply. 'She is\r\nlooking forward to seeing you. Though why....'\r\n\r\n'Why?' prompted Frederick coldly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, nothing.'\r\n\r\nIn the unpleasant silence which followed, broken only by the deep\r\nbreathing of a man who was trying to choose the rudest out of the three\r\nretorts which had presented themselves to him, Nurse Wilks entered.\r\n\r\n'It's just a suggestion,' said Miss Oliphant aloofly, 'but don't you\r\nthink you might help Nanna with that heavy tray?'\r\n\r\nFrederick, roused from his preoccupation, sprang to his feet, blushing\r\nthe blush of shame.\r\n\r\n'You might have strained yourself, Nanna,' the girl went on, in a voice\r\ndripping with indignant sympathy.\r\n\r\n'I was going to help her,' mumbled Frederick.\r\n\r\n'Yes, after she had put the tray down on the table. Poor Nanna! How\r\nvery heavy it must have been.'\r\n\r\nNot for the first time since their acquaintance had begun, Frederick\r\nfelt a sort of wistful wonder at his erstwhile fiancée's uncanny\r\nability to put him in the wrong. His emotions now were rather what they\r\nwould have been if he had been detected striking his hostess with some\r\nblunt instrument.\r\n\r\n'He always was a thoughtless boy,' said Nurse Wilks tolerantly. 'Do sit\r\ndown, Master Frederick, and have your tea. I've boiled some eggs for\r\nyou. I know what a boy you always are for eggs.'\r\n\r\nFrederick, starting, directed a swift glance at the tray. Yes, his\r\nworst fears had been realized. Eggs--and large ones. A stomach which\r\nhe had fallen rather into the habit of pampering of late years gave a\r\nlittle whimper of apprehension.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' proceeded Nurse Wilks, pursuing the subject, 'you never could\r\nhave enough eggs. Nor cake. Dear me, how sick you made yourself with\r\ncake that day at Miss Jane's birthday party.'\r\n\r\n'Please!' said Miss Oliphant, with a slight shiver.\r\n\r\nShe looked coldly at her fermenting fellow-guest, as he sat plumbing\r\nthe deepest abysses of self-loathing.\r\n\r\n'No eggs for me, thank you,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Master Frederick, you will eat your nice boiled eggs,' said Nurse\r\nWilks. Her voice was still amiable, but there was a hint of dynamite\r\nbehind it.\r\n\r\n'I don't want any eggs.'\r\n\r\n'Master Frederick!' The dynamite exploded. Once again that amazing\r\ntransformation had taken place, and a frail little old woman had become\r\nan intimidating force with which only a Napoleon could have reckoned.\r\n'I will not have this sulking.'\r\n\r\nFrederick gulped.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' he said, meekly. 'I should enjoy an egg.'\r\n\r\n'Two eggs,' corrected Nurse Wilks.\r\n\r\n'Two eggs,' said Frederick.\r\n\r\nMiss Oliphant twisted the knife in the wound.\r\n\r\n'There seems to be plenty of cake, too. How nice for you! Still, I\r\nshould be careful, if I were you. It looks rather rich. I never could\r\nunderstand,' she went on, addressing Nurse Wilks in a voice which\r\nFrederick, who was now about seven years old, considered insufferably\r\ngrown-up and affected, 'why people should find any enjoyment in\r\nstuffing and gorging and making pigs of themselves.'\r\n\r\n'Boys will be boys,' argued Nurse Wilks.\r\n\r\n'I suppose so,' sighed Miss Oliphant. 'Still, it's all rather\r\nunpleasant.'\r\n\r\nA slight but well-defined glitter appeared in Nurse Wilks's eyes. She\r\ndetected a tendency to hoighty-toightiness in her young guest's manner,\r\nand hoighty-toightiness was a thing to be checked.\r\n\r\n'Girls,' she said, 'are by no means perfect.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' breathed Frederick, in rapturous adhesion to the sentiment.\r\n\r\n'Girls have their little faults. Girls are sometimes inclined to be\r\nvain. I know a little girl not a hundred miles from this room who was\r\nso proud of her new panties that she ran out in the street in them.'\r\n\r\n'Nanna!' cried Miss Oliphant pinkly.\r\n\r\n'Disgusting!' said Frederick.\r\n\r\nHe uttered a short laugh: and so full was this laugh, though short, of\r\nscorn, disdain, and a certain hideous masculine superiority, that Jane\r\nOliphant's proud spirit writhed beneath the infliction. She turned on\r\nhim with blazing eyes.\r\n\r\n'What did you say?'\r\n\r\n'I said \"Disgusting!\"'\r\n\r\n'Indeed?'\r\n\r\n'I cannot,' said Frederick judicially, 'imagine a more deplorable\r\nexhibition, and I hope you were sent to bed without any supper.'\r\n\r\n'If you ever had to go without your supper,' said Miss Oliphant, who\r\nbelieved in attack as the best form of defence, 'it would kill you.'\r\n\r\n'Is that so?' said Frederick.\r\n\r\n'You're a beast, and I hate you,' said Miss Oliphant.\r\n\r\n'Is that so?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, that is so.'\r\n\r\n'Now, now, now,' said Nurse Wilks. 'Come, come, come!'\r\n\r\nShe eyed the two with that comfortable look of power and capability\r\nwhich comes naturally to women who have spent half a century in dealing\r\nwith the young and fractious.\r\n\r\n'We will have no quarrelling,' she said. 'Make it up at once. Master\r\nFrederick, give Miss Jane a nice kiss.'\r\n\r\nThe room rocked before Frederick's bulging eyes.\r\n\r\n'A what?' he gasped.\r\n\r\n'Give her a nice big kiss and tell her you're sorry you quarrelled with\r\nher.'\r\n\r\n'She quarrelled with me.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind. A little gentleman must always take the blame.'\r\n\r\nFrederick, working desperately, dragged to the surface a sketchy smile.\r\n\r\n'I apologize,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Don't mention it,' said Miss Oliphant.\r\n\r\n'Kiss her,' said Nurse Wilks.\r\n\r\n'I won't!' said Frederick.\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'I won't.'\r\n\r\n'Master Frederick,' said Nurse Wilks, rising and pointing a menacing\r\nfinger, 'you march straight into that cupboard in the passage and stay\r\nthere till you are good.'\r\n\r\nFrederick hesitated. He came of a proud family. A Mulliner had once\r\nreceived the thanks of his Sovereign for services rendered on the field\r\nof Crécy. But the recollection of what his brother George had said\r\ndecided him. Infra dig. as it might be to allow himself to be shoved\r\naway in cupboards, it was better than being responsible for a woman's\r\nheart-failure. With bowed head he passed through the door, and a key\r\nclicked behind him.\r\n\r\nAll alone in a dark world that smelt of mice, Frederick Mulliner gave\r\nhimself up to gloomy reflection. He had just put in about two minutes'\r\nintense thought of a kind which would have made the meditations of\r\nSchopenhauer on one of his bad mornings seem like the day-dreams of\r\nPollyanna, when a voice spoke through the crack in the door.\r\n\r\n'Freddie. I mean Mr Mulliner.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'She's gone into the kitchen to get the jam,' proceeded the voice\r\nrapidly. 'Shall I let you out?'\r\n\r\n'Pray do not trouble,' said Frederick coldly. 'I am perfectly\r\ncomfortable.'\r\n\r\nSilence followed. Frederick returned to his reverie. About now, he\r\nthought, but for his brother George's treachery in luring him down to\r\nthis plague-spot by a misleading telegram, he would have been on the\r\ntwelfth green at Squashy Hollow, trying out that new putter. Instead of\r\nwhich....\r\n\r\nThe door opened abruptly, and as abruptly closed again. And Frederick\r\nMulliner, who had been looking forward to an unbroken solitude,\r\ndiscovered with a good deal of astonishment that he had started taking\r\nin lodgers.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing here?' he demanded, with a touch of proprietorial\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\nThe girl did not answer. But presently muffled sounds came to him\r\nthrough the darkness. In spite of himself, a certain tenderness crept\r\nupon Frederick.\r\n\r\n'I say,' he said awkwardly. 'There's nothing to cry about.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not crying. I'm laughing.'\r\n\r\n'Oh?' The tenderness waned. 'You think it's amusing, do you, being shut\r\nup in this damned cupboard....'\r\n\r\n'There is no need to use bad language.'\r\n\r\n'I entirely disagree with you. There is every need to use bad language.\r\nIt's ghastly enough being at Bingley-on-Sea at all, but when it comes\r\nto being shut up in Bingley cupboards....'\r\n\r\n'... with a girl you hate?'\r\n\r\n'We will not go into that aspect of the matter,' said Frederick with\r\ndignity. 'The important point is that here I am in a cupboard at\r\nBingley-on-Sea when, if there were any justice or right-thinking in the\r\nworld, I should be out at Squashy Hollow....'\r\n\r\n'Oh? Do you still play golf?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly I still play golf. Why not?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know why not. I'm glad you are still able to amuse yourself.'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean, still? Do you think that just because....'\r\n\r\n'I don't think anything.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you imagined I would be creeping about the place, a\r\nbroken-hearted wreck?'\r\n\r\n'Oh no. I knew you would find it easy to console yourself.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean by that?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind.'\r\n\r\n'Are you insinuating that I am the sort of man who turns lightly from\r\none woman to another--a mere butterfly who flits from flower to flower,\r\nsipping...?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, if you want to know, I think you are a born sipper.'\r\n\r\nFrederick started. The charge was monstrous.\r\n\r\n'I have never sipped. And, what's more, I have never flitted.'\r\n\r\n'That's funny.'\r\n\r\n'What's funny?'\r\n\r\n'What you said.'\r\n\r\n'You appear to have a very keen sense of humour,' said Frederick\r\nweightily. 'It amuses you to be shut up in cupboards. It amuses you to\r\nhear me say....'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's nice to be able to get some amusement out of life, isn't\r\nit? Do you want to know why she shut me up in here?'\r\n\r\n'I haven't the slightest curiosity. Why?'\r\n\r\n'I forgot where I was and lighted a cigarette. Oh, my goodness!'\r\n\r\n'Now what?'\r\n\r\n'I thought I heard a mouse. Do you think there are mice in this\r\ncupboard?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' said Frederick. 'Dozens of them.'\r\n\r\nHe would have gone on to specify the kind of mice--large, fat,\r\nslithery, active mice: but at this juncture something hard and sharp\r\ntook him agonizingly on the ankle.\r\n\r\n'Ouch!' cried Frederick.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I'm sorry. Was that you?'\r\n\r\n'It was.'\r\n\r\n'I was kicking about to discourage the mice.'\r\n\r\n'I see.'\r\n\r\n'Did it hurt much?'\r\n\r\n'Only a trifle more than blazes, thank you for inquiring.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry.'\r\n\r\n'So am I.'\r\n\r\n'Anyway, it would have given a mouse a nasty jar, if it had been one,\r\nwouldn't it?'\r\n\r\n'The shock, I should imagine, of a lifetime.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm sorry.'\r\n\r\n'Don't mention it. Why should I worry about a broken ankle, when....'\r\n\r\n'When what?'\r\n\r\n'I forgot what I was going to say.'\r\n\r\n'When your heart is broken?'\r\n\r\n'My heart is not broken.' It was a point which Frederick wished to make\r\nluminously clear. 'I am gay ... happy.... Who the devil is this man\r\nDillingwater?' he concluded abruptly.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause.\r\n\r\n'Oh, just a man.'\r\n\r\n'Where did you meet him?'\r\n\r\n'At the Ponderbys'.'\r\n\r\n'Where did you get engaged to him?'\r\n\r\n'At the Ponderbys'.'\r\n\r\n'Did you pay another visit to the Ponderbys', then?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\nFrederick choked.\r\n\r\n'When you went to stay with the Ponderbys, you were engaged to me.\r\nDo you mean to say you broke off your engagement to me, met this\r\nDillingwater, and got engaged to him all in the course of a single\r\nvisit lasting barely two weeks?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nFrederick said nothing. It struck him later that he should have said\r\n'Oh, Woman, Woman!' but at the moment it did not occur to him.\r\n\r\n'I don't see what right you have to criticize me,' said Jane.\r\n\r\n'Who criticized you?'\r\n\r\n'You did.'\r\n\r\n'When?'\r\n\r\n'Just then.'\r\n\r\n'I call Heaven to witness,' cried Frederick Mulliner, 'that not by so\r\nmuch as a single word have I hinted at my opinion that your conduct is\r\nthe vilest and most revolting that has ever been drawn to my attention.\r\nI never so much as suggested that your revelation had shocked me to the\r\ndepths of my soul.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you did. You sniffed.'\r\n\r\n'If Bingley-on-Sea is not open for being sniffed in at this season,'\r\nsaid Frederick coldly, 'I should have been informed earlier.'\r\n\r\n'I had a perfect right to get engaged to anyone I liked and as quick as\r\nI liked, after the abominable way you behaved.'\r\n\r\n'Abominable way I behaved? What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'You know.'\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, I do not know. If you are alluding to my refusal to wear\r\nthe tie you bought for me on my last birthday, I can but repeat my\r\nstatement, made to you at the time, that, apart from being the sort of\r\ntie no upright man would be seen dead in a ditch with, its colours were\r\nthose of a Cycling, Angling, and Dart-Throwing club of which I am not a\r\nmember.'\r\n\r\n'I am not alluding to that. I mean the day I was going to the\r\nPonderbys' and you promised to see me off at Paddington, and then\r\nyou phoned and said you couldn't as you were detained by important\r\nbusiness, and I thought, well, I think I'll go by the later train after\r\nall because that will give me time to lunch quietly at the Berkeley,\r\nand I went and lunched quietly at the Berkeley, and when I was there\r\nwho should I see but you at a table at the other end of the room\r\ngorging yourself in the company of a beastly creature in a pink frock\r\nand henna'd hair. That's what I mean.'\r\n\r\nFrederick clutched at his forehead.\r\n\r\n'Repeat that,' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nJane did so.\r\n\r\n'Ye gods!' said Frederick.\r\n\r\n'It was like a blow over the head. Something seemed to snap inside me,\r\nand....'\r\n\r\n'I can explain all,' said Frederick.\r\n\r\nJane's voice in the darkness was cold.\r\n\r\n'Explain?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Explain,' said Frederick.\r\n\r\n'All?'\r\n\r\n'All.'\r\n\r\nJane coughed.\r\n\r\n'Before beginning,' she said, 'do not forget that I know every one of\r\nyour female relatives by sight.'\r\n\r\n'I don't want to talk about my female relatives.'\r\n\r\n'I thought you were going to say that she was one of them--an aunt or\r\nsomething.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing of the kind. She was a revue star. You probably saw her in a\r\npiece called _Toot-Toot_.'\r\n\r\n'And that is your idea of an explanation!'\r\n\r\nFrederick raised his hand for silence. Realizing that she could not see\r\nit, he lowered it again.\r\n\r\n'Jane,' he said in a low, throbbing voice, 'can you cast your mind back\r\nto a morning in the spring when we walked, you and I, in Kensington\r\nGardens? The sun shone brightly, the sky was a limpid blue flecked with\r\nfleecy clouds, and from the west there blew a gentle breeze....'\r\n\r\n'If you think you can melt me with that sort of....'\r\n\r\n'Nothing of the kind. What I was leading up to was this. As we\r\nwalked, you and I, there came snuffling up to us a small Pekinese dog.\r\nIt left me, I admit, quite cold, but you went into ecstasies: and\r\nfrom that moment I had but one mission in life, to discover who that\r\nPeke belonged to and buy it for you. And after the most exhaustive\r\ninquiries, I tracked the animal down. It was the property of the\r\nlady in whose company you saw me lunching--lightly, not gorging--at\r\nthe Berkeley that day. I managed to get an introduction to her, and\r\nimmediately began to make offers to her for the dog. Money was no\r\nobject to me. All I wished was to put the little beast in your arms\r\nand see your face light up. It was to be a surprise. That morning the\r\nwoman phoned, and said that she had practically decided to close with\r\nmy latest bid, and would I take her to lunch and discuss the matter?\r\nIt was agony to have to ring you up and tell you that I could not see\r\nyou off at Paddington, but it had to be done. It was anguish having to\r\nsit for two hours listening to that highly-coloured female telling me\r\nhow the comedian had ruined her big number in her last show by standing\r\nup-stage and pretending to drink ink, but that had to be done too. I\r\nbit the bullet and saw it through and I got the dog that afternoon. And\r\nnext morning I received your letter breaking off the engagement.'\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n'Is this true?' said Jane.\r\n\r\n'Quite true.'\r\n\r\n'It sounds too--how shall I put it?--too frightfully probable. Look me\r\nin the face!'\r\n\r\n'What's the good of looking you in the face when I can't see an inch in\r\nfront of me?'\r\n\r\n'Well, is it true?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly it is true.'\r\n\r\n'Can you produce the Peke?'\r\n\r\n'I have not got it on my person,' said Frederick stiffly. 'But it is at\r\nmy flat, probably chewing up a valuable rug. I will give it you for a\r\nwedding present.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Freddie!'\r\n\r\n'A wedding present,' repeated Frederick, though the words stuck in his\r\nthroat like patent American health-cereal.\r\n\r\n'But I'm not going to be married.'\r\n\r\n'You're--what did you say?'\r\n\r\n'I'm not going to be married.'\r\n\r\n'But what of Dillingwater?'\r\n\r\n'That's off.'\r\n\r\n'Off?'\r\n\r\n'Off,' said Jane firmly. 'I only got engaged to him out of pique. I\r\nthought I could go through with it, buoying myself up by thinking what\r\na score it would be off you, but one morning I saw him eating a peach\r\nand I began to waver. He splashed himself to the eyebrows. And just\r\nafter that I found that he had a trick of making a sort of funny noise\r\nwhen he drank coffee. I would sit on the other side of the breakfast\r\ntable, looking at him and saying to myself \"Now comes the funny noise!\"\r\nand when I thought of doing that all the rest of my life I saw that the\r\nscheme was impossible. So I broke off the engagement.'\r\n\r\nFrederick gasped.\r\n\r\n'Jane!'\r\n\r\nHe groped out, found her, and drew her into his arms.\r\n\r\n'Freddie!'\r\n\r\n'Jane!'\r\n\r\n'Freddie!'\r\n\r\n'Jane!'\r\n\r\n'Freddie!'\r\n\r\n'Jane!'\r\n\r\nOn the panel of the door there sounded an authoritative rap. Through it\r\nthere spoke an authoritative voice, slightly cracked by age but full,\r\nnevertheless, of the spirit that will stand no nonsense.\r\n\r\n'Master Frederick.'\r\n\r\n'Hullo?'\r\n\r\n'Are you good now?'\r\n\r\n'You bet I'm good.'\r\n\r\n'Will you give Miss Jane a nice kiss?'\r\n\r\n'I will do,' said Frederick Mulliner, enthusiasm ringing in every\r\nsyllable, 'just that little thing!'\r\n\r\n'Then you may come out,' said Nurse Wilks. 'I have boiled you two more\r\neggs.'\r\n\r\nFrederick paled, but only for an instant. What did anything matter now?\r\nHis lips were set in a firm line, and his voice, when he spoke, was\r\ncalm and steady.\r\n\r\n'Lead me to them,' he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   8\r\n\r\n                    THE ROMANCE OF A BULB-SQUEEZER\r\n\r\n\r\nSomebody had left a copy of an illustrated weekly paper in the\r\nbar-parlour of the Anglers' Rest; and, glancing through it, I came upon\r\nthe ninth full-page photograph of a celebrated musical-comedy actress\r\nthat I had seen since the preceding Wednesday. This one showed her\r\nlooking archly over her shoulder with a rose between her teeth, and I\r\nflung the periodical from me with a stifled cry.\r\n\r\n'Tut, tut!' said Mr Mulliner, reprovingly. 'You must not allow these\r\nthings to affect you so deeply. Remember, it is not actresses'\r\nphotographs that matter, but the courage which we bring to them.'\r\n\r\nHe sipped his hot Scotch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wonder if you have ever reflected (he said gravely) what life must be\r\nlike for the men whose trade it is to make these pictures? Statistics\r\nshow that the two classes of the community which least often marry are\r\nmilkmen and fashionable photographers--milkmen because they see women\r\ntoo early in the morning, and fashionable photographers because their\r\ndays are spent in an atmosphere of feminine loveliness so monotonous\r\nthat they become surfeited and morose. I know of none of the world's\r\nworkers whom I pity more sincerely than the fashionable photographer;\r\nand yet--by one of those strokes of irony which make the thoughtful\r\nman waver between sardonic laughter and sympathetic tears--it is the\r\nambition of every youngster who enters the profession some day to\r\nbecome one.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his career, you see, a young photographer is sorely\r\noppressed by human gargoyles: and gradually this begins to prey upon\r\nhis nerves.\r\n\r\n'Why is it,' I remember my cousin Clarence saying, after he had been\r\nabout a year in the business, 'that all these misfits want to be\r\nphotographed? Why do men with faces which you would have thought they\r\nwould be anxious to hush up wish to be strewn about the country on\r\nwhatnots and in albums? I started out full of ardour and enthusiasm,\r\nand my eager soul is being crushed. This morning the Mayor of Tooting\r\nEast came to make an appointment. He is coming tomorrow afternoon\r\nto be taken in his cocked hat and robes of office; and there is\r\nabsolutely no excuse for a man with a face like that perpetuating his\r\nfeatures. I wish to goodness I was one of those fellows who only take\r\ncamera-portraits of beautiful women.'\r\n\r\nHis dream was to come true sooner than he had imagined. Within a week\r\nthe great test-case of Biggs _v._ Mulliner had raised my cousin\r\nClarence from an obscure studio in West Kensington to the position of\r\nLondon's most famous photographer.\r\n\r\nYou possibly remember the case? The events that led up to it were,\r\nbriefly, as follows:\r\n\r\nJno. Horatio Biggs, O.B.E., the newly-elected Mayor of Tooting East,\r\nalighted from a cab at the door of Clarence Mulliner's studio at\r\nfour-ten on the afternoon of June the seventeenth. At four-eleven\r\nhe went in. And at four-sixteen and a half he was observed shooting\r\nout of a first-floor window, vigorously assisted by my cousin, who\r\nwas prodding him in the seat of the trousers with the sharp end of a\r\nphotographic tripod. Those who were in a position to see stated that\r\nClarence's face was distorted by a fury scarcely human.\r\n\r\nNaturally the matter could not be expected to rest there. A week\r\nlater the case of Biggs _v._ Mulliner had begun, the plaintiff\r\nclaiming damages to the extent of ten thousand pounds and a new pair of\r\ntrousers. And at first things looked very black for Clarence.\r\n\r\nIt was the speech of Sir Joseph Bodger, K.C., briefed for the defence,\r\nthat turned the scale.\r\n\r\n'I do not,' said Sir Joseph, addressing the jury on the second day,\r\n'propose to deny the charges which have been brought against my client.\r\nWe freely admit that on the seventeenth inst. we did jab the defendant\r\nwith our tripod in a manner calculated to cause alarm and despondency.\r\nBut, gentlemen, we plead justification. The whole case turns upon one\r\nquestion. Is a photographer entitled to assault--either with or, as\r\nthe case may be, without a tripod--a sitter who, after being warned\r\nthat his face is not up to the minimum standard requirements, insists\r\nupon remaining in the chair and moistening the lips with the tip of the\r\ntongue? Gentlemen, I say Yes!\r\n\r\n'Unless you decide in favour of my client, gentlemen of the jury,\r\nphotographers--debarred by law from the privilege of rejecting\r\nsitters--will be at the mercy of anyone who comes along with the price\r\nof a dozen photographs in his pocket. You have seen the plaintiff,\r\nBiggs. You have noted his broad, slab-like face, intolerable to any man\r\nof refinement and sensibility. You have observed his walrus moustache,\r\nhis double chin, his protruding eyes. Take another look at him, and\r\nthen tell me if my client was not justified in chasing him with a\r\ntripod out of that sacred temple of Art and Beauty, his studio.\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, I have finished. I leave my client's fate in your hands\r\nwith every confidence that you will return the only verdict that can\r\nconceivably issue from twelve men of your obvious intelligence, your\r\nmanifest sympathy, and your superb breadth of vision.'\r\n\r\nOf course, after that there was nothing to it. The jury decided in\r\nClarence's favour without leaving the box; and the crowd waiting\r\noutside to hear the verdict carried him shoulder-high to his house,\r\nrefusing to disperse until he had made a speech and sung Photographers\r\nnever, never, never shall be slaves. And next morning every paper in\r\nEngland came out with a leading article commending him for having so\r\ncourageously established, as it had not been established since the days\r\nof Magna Carta, the fundamental principle of the Liberty of the Subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe effect of this publicity on Clarence's fortunes was naturally\r\nstupendous. He had become in a flash the best-known photographer in\r\nthe United Kingdom, and was now in a position to realize that vision\r\nwhich he had of taking the pictures of none but the beaming and the\r\nbeautiful. Every day the loveliest ornaments of Society and the\r\nStage flocked to his studio; and it was with the utmost astonishment,\r\ntherefore, that, calling upon him one morning on my return to England\r\nafter an absence of two years in the East, I learned that Fame and\r\nWealth had not brought him happiness.\r\n\r\nI found him sitting moodily in his studio, staring with dull eyes at a\r\ncamera-portrait of a well-known actress in a bathing-suit. He looked up\r\nlistlessly as I entered.\r\n\r\n'Clarence!' I cried, shocked at his appearance, for there were hard\r\nlines about his mouth and wrinkles on a forehead that once had been\r\nsmooth as alabaster. 'What is wrong?'\r\n\r\n'Everything,' he replied, 'I'm fed up.'\r\n\r\n'What with?'\r\n\r\n'Life. Beautiful women. This beastly photography business.'\r\n\r\nI was amazed. Even in the East rumours of his success had reached me,\r\nand on my return to London I found that they had not been exaggerated.\r\nIn every photographers' club in the Metropolis, from the Negative and\r\nSolution in Pall Mall to the humble public-houses frequented by the men\r\nwho do your pictures while you wait on the sands at seaside resorts, he\r\nwas being freely spoken of as the logical successor to the Presidency\r\nof the Amalgamated Guild of Bulb-Squeezers.\r\n\r\n'I can't stick it much longer,' said Clarence, tearing the\r\ncamera-portrait into a dozen pieces with a dry sob and burying his face\r\nin his hands. 'Actresses nursing their dolls! Countesses simpering over\r\nkittens! Film stars among their books! In ten minutes I go to catch a\r\ntrain at Waterloo. I have been sent for by the Duchess of Hampshire to\r\ntake some studies of Lady Monica Southbourne in the castle grounds.'\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through him. I patted him on the shoulder. I understood\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n'She has the most brilliant smile in England,' he whispered.\r\n\r\n'Come, come!'\r\n\r\n'Coy yet roguish, they tell me.'\r\n\r\n'It may not be true.'\r\n\r\n'And I bet she will want to be taken offering a lump of sugar to her\r\ndog, and the picture will appear in the _Sketch_ and _Tatler_\r\nas \"Lady Monica Southbourne and Friend\".'\r\n\r\n'Clarence, this is morbid.'\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n'Ah, well,' he said, pulling himself together with a visible effort, 'I\r\nhave made my sodium sulphite, and I must lie in it.'\r\n\r\nI saw him off in a cab. The last view I had of him was of his pale,\r\ndrawn profile. He looked, I thought, like an aristocrat of the French\r\nRevolution being borne off to his doom on a tumbril. How little he\r\nguessed that the only girl in the world lay waiting for him round the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo, you are wrong. Lady Monica did not turn out to be the only girl\r\nin the world. If what I said caused you to expect that, I misled you.\r\nLady Monica proved to be all his fancy had pictured her. In fact even\r\nmore. Not only was her smile coy yet roguish, but she had a sort of\r\ncoquettish droop of the left eyelid of which no one had warned him.\r\nAnd, in addition to her two dogs, which she was portrayed in the act of\r\nfeeding with two lumps of sugar, she possessed a totally unforeseen pet\r\nmonkey, of which he was compelled to take no fewer than eleven studies.\r\n\r\nNo, it was not Lady Monica who captured Clarence's heart, but a girl in\r\na taxi whom he met on his way to the station.\r\n\r\nIt was in a traffic jam at the top of Whitehall that he first observed\r\nthis girl. His cab had become becalmed in a sea of omnibuses, and,\r\nchancing to look to the right, he perceived within a few feet of him\r\nanother taxi, which had been heading for Trafalgar Square. There was a\r\nface at its window. It turned towards him, and their eyes met.\r\n\r\nTo most men it would have seemed an unattractive face. To Clarence,\r\nsurfeited with the coy, the beaming, and the delicately-chiselled,\r\nit was the most wonderful thing he had ever looked at. All his life,\r\nhe felt, he had been searching for something on these lines. That\r\nsnub-nose--those freckles--that breadth of cheekbone--the squareness of\r\nthat chin. And not a dimple in sight. He told me afterwards that his\r\nonly feeling at first was one of incredulity. He had not believed that\r\nthe world contained women like this. And then the traffic jam loosened\r\nup and he was carried away.\r\n\r\nIt was as he was passing the Houses of Parliament that the realization\r\ncame to him that the strange bubbly sensation that seemed to start\r\nfrom just above the lower left side-pocket of his waistcoat was not,\r\nas he had at first supposed, dyspepsia, but love. Yes, love had come\r\nat long last to Clarence Mulliner; and for all the good it was likely\r\nto do him, he reflected bitterly, it might just as well have been the\r\ndyspepsia for which he had mistaken it. He loved a girl whom he would\r\nprobably never see again. He did not know her name or where she lived\r\nor anything about her. All he knew was that he would cherish her image\r\nin his heart for ever, and that the thought of going on with the old\r\ndreary round of photographing lovely women with coy yet roguish smiles\r\nwas almost more than he could bear.\r\n\r\nHowever, custom is strong; and a man who has once allowed the\r\nbulb-squeezing habit to get a grip on him cannot cast it off in a\r\nmoment. Next day Clarence was back in his studio, diving into the\r\nvelvet nose-bag as of yore and telling peeresses to watch the little\r\nbirdie just as if nothing had happened. And if there was now a strange,\r\nhaunting look of pain in his eyes, nobody objected to that. Indeed,\r\ninasmuch as the grief which gnawed at his heart had the effect of\r\ndeepening and mellowing his camera-side manner to an almost sacerdotal\r\nunctuousness, his private sorrows actually helped his professional\r\nprestige. Women told one another that being photographed by Clarence\r\nMulliner was like undergoing some wonderful spiritual experience in a\r\nnoble cathedral; and his appointment-book became fuller than ever.\r\n\r\nSo great now was his reputation that to anyone who had had the\r\nprivilege of being taken by him, either full face or in profile, the\r\ndoors of Society opened automatically. It was whispered that his name\r\nwas to appear in the next Birthday Honours List; and at the annual\r\nbanquet of the Amalgamated Bulb-Squeezers, when Sir Godfrey Stooge,\r\nthe retiring President, in proposing his health, concluded a glowingly\r\neulogistic speech with the words, 'Gentlemen, I give you my destined\r\nsuccessor, Mulliner the Liberator!' five hundred frantic photographers\r\nalmost shivered the glasses on the table with their applause.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he was not happy. He had lost the only girl he had ever loved,\r\nand without her what was Fame? What was Affluence? What were the\r\nHighest Honours in the Land?\r\n\r\nThese were the questions he was asking himself one night as he sat in\r\nhis library, sombrely sipping a final whisky-and-soda before retiring.\r\nHe had asked them once and was going to ask them again, when he was\r\ninterrupted by the sound of someone ringing at the front-door bell.\r\n\r\nHe rose, surprised. It was late for callers. The domestic staff had\r\ngone to bed, so he went to the door and opened it. A shadowy figure was\r\nstanding on the steps.\r\n\r\n'Mr Mulliner?'\r\n\r\n'I am Mr Mulliner.'\r\n\r\nThe man stepped past him into the hall. And, as he did so, Clarence saw\r\nthat he was wearing over the upper half of his face a black velvet mask.\r\n\r\n'I must apologize for hiding my face, Mr Mulliner,' the visitor said,\r\nas Clarence led him to the library.\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' replied Clarence, courteously. 'No doubt it is all for\r\nthe best.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed?' said the other, with a touch of asperity. 'If you really want\r\nto know, I am probably as handsome a man as there is in London. But my\r\nmission is one of such extraordinary secrecy that I dare not run the\r\nrisk of being recognized.' He paused, and Clarence saw his eyes glint\r\nthrough the holes in the mask as he directed a rapid gaze into each\r\ncorner of the library, 'Mr Mulliner, have you any acquaintance with the\r\nramifications of international secret politics?'\r\n\r\n'I have.'\r\n\r\n'And you are a patriot?'\r\n\r\n'I am.'\r\n\r\n'Then I can speak freely. No doubt you are aware, Mr Mulliner, that\r\nfor some time past this country and a certain rival Power have been\r\ncompeting for the friendship and alliance of a certain other Power?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Clarence, 'they didn't tell me that.'\r\n\r\n'Such is the case. And the President of this Power--'\r\n\r\n'Which one?'\r\n\r\n'The second one.'\r\n\r\n'Call it B.'\r\n\r\n'The President of Power B is now in London. He arrived incognito,\r\ntravelling under the assumed name of J. J. Shubert: and the\r\nrepresentatives of Power A, to the best of our knowledge, are not yet\r\naware of his presence. This gives us just the few hours necessary to\r\nclinch this treaty with Power B before Power A can interfere. I ought\r\nto tell you, Mr Mulliner, that if Power B forms an alliance with\r\nthis country, the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race will be secured\r\nfor hundreds of years. Whereas if Power A gets hold of Power B,\r\ncivilization will be thrown into the melting-pot. In the eyes of all\r\nEurope--and when I say all Europe I refer particularly to Powers C, D,\r\nand E--this nation would sink to the rank of a fourth-class Power.'\r\n\r\n'Call it Power F,' said Clarence.\r\n\r\n'It rests with you, Mr Mulliner, to save England.'\r\n\r\n'Great Britain,' corrected Clarence. He was half Scotch on his mother's\r\nside. 'But how? What can I do about it?'\r\n\r\n'The position is this. The President of Power B has an overwhelming\r\ndesire to have his photograph taken by Clarence Mulliner. Consent\r\nto take it, and our difficulties will be at an end. Overcome with\r\ngratitude, he will sign the treaty, and the Anglo-Saxon race will be\r\nsafe.'\r\n\r\nClarence did not hesitate. Apart from the natural gratification of\r\nfeeling that he was doing the Anglo-Saxon race a bit of good, business\r\nwas business; and if the President took a dozen of the large size\r\nfinished in silver wash it would mean a nice profit.\r\n\r\n'I shall be delighted,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Your patriotism,' said the visitor, 'will not go unrewarded. It will\r\nbe gratefully noted in the Very Highest Circles.'\r\n\r\nClarence reached for his appointment-book.\r\n\r\n'Now, let me see. Wednesday?--No, I'm full up Wednesday. Thursday?--No.\r\nSuppose the President looks in at my studio between four and five on\r\nFriday?'\r\n\r\nThe visitor uttered a gasp.\r\n\r\n'Good heavens, Mr Mulliner,' he exclaimed, 'surely you do not imagine\r\nthat, with the vast issues at stake, these things can be done openly\r\nand in daylight? If the devils in the pay of Power A were to learn\r\nthat the President intended to have his photograph taken by you, I\r\nwould not give a straw for your chances of living an hour.'\r\n\r\n'Then what do you suggest?'\r\n\r\n'You must accompany me now to the President's suite at the Milan Hotel.\r\nWe shall travel in a closed car, and God send that these fiends did not\r\nrecognize me as I came here. If they did, we shall never reach that car\r\nalive. Have you, by any chance, while we have been talking, heard the\r\nhoot of an owl?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Clarence. 'No owls.'\r\n\r\n'Then perhaps they are nowhere near. The fiends always imitate the hoot\r\nof an owl.'\r\n\r\n'A thing,' said Clarence, 'which I tried to do when I was a small\r\nboy and never seemed able to manage. The popular idea that owls\r\nsay \"Tu-whit, tu-whoo\" is all wrong. The actual noise they make is\r\nsomething far more difficult and complex, and it was beyond me.'\r\n\r\n'Quite so.' The visitor looked at his watch. 'However, absorbing as\r\nthese reminiscences of your boyhood days are, time is flying. Shall we\r\nbe making a start?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly.'\r\n\r\n'Then follow me.'\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be holiday-time for fiends, or else the night-shift\r\nhad not yet come on, for they reached the car without being molested.\r\nClarence stepped in, and his masked visitor, after a keen look up and\r\ndown the street, followed him.\r\n\r\n'Talking of my boyhood--' began Clarence.\r\n\r\nThe sentence was never completed. A soft wet pad was pressed over his\r\nnostrils: the air became a-reek with the sickly fumes of chloroform:\r\nand Clarence knew no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he came to, he was no longer in the car. He found himself lying\r\non a bed in a room in a strange house. It was a medium-sized room with\r\nscarlet wall-paper, simply furnished with a wash-hand stand, a chest\r\nof drawers, two cane-bottomed chairs, and a 'God Bless Our Home' motto\r\nframed in oak. He was conscious of a severe headache, and was about\r\nto rise and make for the water-bottle on the wash-stand when, to his\r\nconsternation, he discovered that his arms and legs were shackled with\r\nstout cord.\r\n\r\nAs a family, the Mulliners have always been noted for their reckless\r\ncourage; and Clarence was no exception to the rule. But for an instant\r\nhis heart undeniably beat a little faster. He saw now that his masked\r\nvisitor had tricked him. Instead of being a representative of His\r\nMajesty's Diplomatic Service (a most respectable class of men), he had\r\nreally been all along a fiend in the pay of Power A.\r\n\r\nNo doubt he and his vile associates were even now chuckling at the ease\r\nwith which their victim had been duped. Clarence gritted his teeth and\r\nstruggled vainly to loose the knots which secured his wrists. He had\r\nfallen back exhausted when he heard the sound of a key turning and the\r\ndoor opened. Somebody crossed the room and stood by the bed, looking\r\ndown on him.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer was a stout man with a complexion that matched the\r\nwall-paper. He was puffing slightly, as if he had found the stairs\r\ntrying. He had broad, slab-like features; and his face was split in the\r\nmiddle by a walrus moustache. Somewhere and in some place, Clarence was\r\nconvinced, he had seen this man before.\r\n\r\nAnd then it all came back to him. An open window with a pleasant summer\r\nbreeze blowing in; a stout man in a cocked hat trying to climb through\r\nthis window; and he, Clarence, doing his best to help him with the\r\nsharp end of a tripod. It was Jno. Horatio Biggs, the Mayor of Tooting\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nA shudder of loathing ran through Clarence.\r\n\r\n'Traitor!' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Eh?' said the Mayor.\r\n\r\n'If anybody had told me that a son of Tooting, nursed in the keen air\r\nof freedom which blows across the Common, would sell himself for gold\r\nto the enemies of his country, I would never have believed it. Well,\r\nyou may tell your employers--'\r\n\r\n'What employers?'\r\n\r\n'Power A.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that?' said the Mayor. 'I am afraid my secretary, whom I\r\ninstructed to bring you to this house, was obliged to romance a little\r\nin order to ensure your accompanying him, Mr Mulliner. All that about\r\nPower A and Power B was just his little joke. If you want to know why\r\nyou were brought here--'\r\n\r\nClarence uttered a low groan.\r\n\r\n'I have guessed your ghastly object, you ghastly object,' he said\r\nquietly. 'You want me to photograph you.'\r\n\r\nThe Mayor shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Not myself. I realize that that can never be. My daughter.'\r\n\r\n'Your daughter?'\r\n\r\n'My daughter.'\r\n\r\n'Does she take after you?'\r\n\r\n'People tell me there is a resemblance.'\r\n\r\n'I refuse,' said Clarence.\r\n\r\n'Think well, Mr Mulliner.'\r\n\r\n'I have done all the thinking that is necessary. England--or,\r\nrather, Great Britain--looks to me to photograph only her fairest\r\nand loveliest; and though, as a man, I admit that I loathe beautiful\r\nwomen, as a photographer I have a duty to consider that is higher than\r\nany personal feelings. History has yet to record an instance of a\r\nphotographer playing his country false, and Clarence Mulliner is not\r\nthe man to supply the first one. I decline your offer.'\r\n\r\n'I wasn't looking on it exactly as an offer,' said the Mayor,\r\nthoughtfully. 'More as a command, if you get my meaning.'\r\n\r\n'You imagine that you can bend a lens-artist to your will and make him\r\nfalse to his professional reputation?'\r\n\r\n'I was thinking of having a try.'\r\n\r\n'Do you realize that, if my incarceration here were known, ten thousand\r\nphotographers would tear this house brick from brick and you limb from\r\nlimb?'\r\n\r\n'But it isn't,' the Mayor pointed out. 'And that, if you follow me, is\r\nthe whole point. You came here by night in a closed car. You could stay\r\nhere for the rest of your life, and no one would be any the wiser. I\r\nreally think you had better reconsider, Mr Mulliner.'\r\n\r\n'You have had my answer.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll leave you to think it over. Dinner will be served at\r\nseven-thirty. Don't bother to dress.' At half past seven precisely\r\nthe door opened again and the Mayor reappeared, followed by a butler\r\nbearing on a silver salver a glass of water and a small slice of bread.\r\nPride urged Clarence to reject the refreshment, but hunger overcame\r\npride. He swallowed the bread which the butler offered him in small\r\nbits in a spoon, and drank the water.\r\n\r\n'At what hour would the gentleman desire breakfast, sir?' asked the\r\nbutler.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said Clarence, for his appetite, always healthy, seemed to have\r\nbeen sharpened by the trials which he had undergone.\r\n\r\n'Let us say nine o'clock,' suggested the Mayor. 'Put aside another\r\nslice of that bread, Meadows. And no doubt Mr Mulliner would enjoy a\r\nglass of this excellent water.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor perhaps half an hour after his host had left him, Clarence's mind\r\nwas obsessed to the exclusion of all other thoughts by a vision of\r\nthe dinner he would have liked to be enjoying. All we Mulliners have\r\nbeen good trenchermen, and to put a bit of bread into it after it had\r\nbeen unoccupied for a whole day was to offer to Clarence's stomach an\r\ninsult which it resented with an indescribable bitterness. Clarence's\r\nonly emotion for some considerable time, then, was that of hunger. His\r\nthoughts centred themselves on food. And it was to this fact, oddly\r\nenough, that he owed his release.\r\n\r\nFor, as he lay there in a sort of delirium, picturing himself getting\r\noutside a medium-cooked steak smothered in onions, with grilled\r\ntomatoes and floury potatoes on the side, it was suddenly borne in upon\r\nhim that this steak did not taste quite so good as other steaks which\r\nhe had eaten in the past. It was tough and lacked juiciness. It tasted\r\njust like rope.\r\n\r\nAnd then, his mind clearing, he saw that it actually was rope. Carried\r\naway by the anguish of hunger, he had been chewing the cord which bound\r\nhis hands; and he now discovered that he had bitten into it quite\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\nA sudden flood of hope poured over Clarence Mulliner. Carrying on at\r\nthis rate, he perceived, he would be able ere long to free himself. It\r\nonly needed a little imagination. After a brief interval to rest his\r\naching jaws, he put himself deliberately into that state of relaxation\r\nwhich is recommended by the apostles of Suggestion.\r\n\r\n'I am entering the dining-room of my club,' murmured Clarence. 'I\r\nam sitting down. The waiter is handing me the bill of fare. I have\r\nselected roast duck with green peas and new potatoes, lamb cutlets with\r\nbrussels sprouts, fricassee of chicken, porterhouse steak, boiled beef\r\nand carrots, leg of mutton, haunch of mutton, mutton chops, curried\r\nmutton, veal, kidneys sauté, spaghetti Caruso, and eggs and bacon,\r\nfried on both sides. The waiter is now bringing my order. I have taken\r\nup my knife and fork. I am beginning to eat.'\r\n\r\nAnd, murmuring a brief grace, Clarence flung himself on the rope and\r\nset to.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later he was hobbling about the room, restoring the\r\ncirculation to his cramped limbs.\r\n\r\nJust as he had succeeded in getting himself nicely limbered up, he\r\nheard the key turning in the door.\r\n\r\nClarence crouched for the spring. The room was quite dark now, and he\r\nwas glad of it, for darkness well fitted the work which lay before\r\nhim. His plans, conceived on the spur of the moment, were necessarily\r\nsketchy, but they included jumping on the Mayor's shoulders and pulling\r\nhis head off. After that, no doubt, other modes of self-expression\r\nwould suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. Clarence made his leap. And he was just about to start\r\non the programme as arranged, when he discovered with a shock of horror\r\nthat this was no O.B.E. that he was being rough with, but a woman. And\r\nno photographer worthy of the name will ever lay a hand upon a woman,\r\nsave to raise her chin and tilt it a little more to the left.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon!' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Don't mention it,' said his visitor, in a low voice. 'I hope I didn't\r\ndisturb you.'\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' said Clarence.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n'Rotten weather,' said Clarence, feeling that it was for him, as the\r\nmale member of the sketch, to keep the conversation going.\r\n\r\n'Yes, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'A lot of rain we've had this summer.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. It seems to get worse every year.'\r\n\r\n'Doesn't it?'\r\n\r\n'So bad for tennis.'\r\n\r\n'And cricket.'\r\n\r\n'And polo.'\r\n\r\n'And garden parties.'\r\n\r\n'I hate rain.'\r\n\r\n'So do I.'\r\n\r\n'Of course, we may have a fine August.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, there's always that.'\r\n\r\nThe ice was broken, and the girl seemed to become more at her ease.\r\n\r\n'I came to let you out,' she said. 'I must apologize for my father. He\r\nloves me foolishly and has no scruples where my happiness is concerned.\r\nHe has always yearned to have me photographed by you, but I cannot\r\nconsent to allow a photographer to be coerced into abandoning his\r\nprinciples. If you will follow me, I will let you out by the front\r\ndoor.'\r\n\r\n'It's awfully good of you,' said Clarence, awkwardly. As any man of\r\nnice sentiment would have been, he was embarrassed. He wished that he\r\ncould have obliged this kind-hearted girl by taking her picture, but\r\na natural delicacy restrained him from touching on this subject. They\r\nwent down the stairs in silence.\r\n\r\nOn the first landing a hand was placed on his in the darkness and the\r\ngirl's voice whispered in his ear.\r\n\r\n'We are just outside father's study,' he heard her say. 'We must be as\r\nquiet as mice.'\r\n\r\n'As what?' said Clarence.\r\n\r\n'Mice.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, rather,' said Clarence, and immediately bumped into what appeared\r\nto be a pedestal of some sort.\r\n\r\nThese pedestals usually have vases on top of them, and it was revealed\r\nto Clarence a moment later that this one was no exception. There was a\r\nnoise like ten simultaneous dinner-services coming apart in the hands\r\nof ten simultaneous parlour-maids; and then the door was flung open,\r\nthe landing became flooded with light, and the Mayor of Tooting East\r\nstood before them. He was carrying a revolver and his face was dark\r\nwith menace.\r\n\r\n'Ha!' said the Mayor.\r\n\r\nBut Clarence was paying no attention to him. He was staring\r\nopen-mouthed at the girl. She had shrunk back against the wall, and the\r\nlight fell full upon her.\r\n\r\n'You!' cried Clarence.\r\n\r\n'This--' began the Mayor.\r\n\r\n'You! At last!'\r\n\r\n'This is a pretty--'\r\n\r\n'Am I dreaming?'\r\n\r\n'This is a pretty state of af--'\r\n\r\n'Ever since that day I saw you in the cab I have been scouring London\r\nfor you. To think that I have found you at last!'\r\n\r\n'This is a pretty state of affairs,' said the Mayor, breathing on the\r\nbarrel of his revolver and polishing it on the sleeve of his coat. 'My\r\ndaughter helping the foe of her family to fly--'\r\n\r\n'Flee, father,' corrected the girl, faintly.\r\n\r\n'Flea or fly--this is no time for arguing about insects. Let me tell\r\nyou--'\r\n\r\nClarence interrupted him indignantly.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean,' he cried, 'by saying that she took after you?'\r\n\r\n'She does.'\r\n\r\n'She does not. She is the loveliest girl in the world, while you look\r\nlike Lon Chaney made up for something. See for yourself.' Clarence led\r\nthem to the large mirror at the head of the stairs. 'Your face--if\r\nyou can call it that--is one of those beastly blobby squashy sort of\r\nfaces--'\r\n\r\n'Here!' said the Mayor.\r\n\r\n'--whereas hers is simply divine. Your eyes are bulbous and goofy--'\r\n\r\n'Hey!' said the Mayor.\r\n\r\n'--while hers are sweet and soft and intelligent. Your ears--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes,' said the Mayor, petulantly. 'Some other time, some other\r\ntime. Then am I to take it, Mr Mulliner--'\r\n\r\n'Call me Clarence.'\r\n\r\n'I refuse to call you Clarence.'\r\n\r\n'You will have to very shortly, when I am your son-in-law.'\r\n\r\nThe girl uttered a cry. The Mayor uttered a louder cry.\r\n\r\n'My son-in-law!'\r\n\r\n'That,' said Clarence, firmly, 'is what I intend to be--and speedily.'\r\nHe turned to the girl. 'I am a man of volcanic passions, and now that\r\nlove has come to me there is no power in heaven or earth that can keep\r\nme from the object of my love. It will be my never-ceasing task--er--'\r\n\r\n'Gladys,' prompted the girl.\r\n\r\n'Thank you. It will be my never-ceasing task, Gladys, to strive daily\r\nto make you return that love--'\r\n\r\n'You need not strive, Clarence,' she whispered, softly. 'It is already\r\nreturned.'\r\n\r\nClarence reeled.\r\n\r\n'Already?' he gasped.\r\n\r\n'I have loved you since I saw you in that cab. When we were torn\r\nasunder, I felt quite faint.'\r\n\r\n'So did I. I was in a daze. I tipped my cabman at Waterloo three\r\nhalf-crowns. I was aflame with love.'\r\n\r\n'I can hardly believe it.'\r\n\r\n'Nor could I, when I found out. I thought it was threepence. And ever\r\nsince that day--'\r\n\r\nThe Mayor coughed.\r\n\r\n'Then am I to take it--er--Clarence,' he said, 'that your objections to\r\nphotographing my daughter are removed?'\r\n\r\nClarence laughed happily.\r\n\r\n'Listen,' he said, 'and I'll show you the sort of son-in-law I am. Ruin\r\nmy professional reputation though it may, I will take a photograph of\r\nyou too!'\r\n\r\n'Me!'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely. Standing beside her with the tips of your fingers on her\r\nshoulder. And what's more, you can wear your cocked hat.'\r\n\r\nTears had begun to trickle down the Mayor's cheeks.\r\n\r\n'My boy!' he sobbed, brokenly. 'My boy!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so happiness came to Clarence Mulliner at last. He never became\r\nPresident of the Bulb-Squeezers, for he retired from business the\r\nnext day, declaring that the hand that had snapped the shutter when\r\ntaking the photograph of his dear wife should never snap it again for\r\nsordid profit. The wedding, which took place some six weeks later, was\r\nattended by almost everybody of any note in Society or on the Stage;\r\nand was the first occasion on which a bride and bridegroom had ever\r\nwalked out of church beneath an arch of crossed tripods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   9\r\n\r\n                          HONEYSUCKLE COTTAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n'Do you believe in ghosts?' asked Mr Mulliner abruptly.\r\n\r\nI weighed the question thoughtfully. I was a little surprised, for\r\nnothing in our previous conversation had suggested the topic.\r\n\r\n'Well,' I replied, 'I don't like them, if that's what you mean. I was\r\nonce butted by one as a child.'\r\n\r\n'Ghosts. Not goats.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, ghosts? Do I believe in ghosts?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly.'\r\n\r\n'Well, yes--and no.'\r\n\r\n'Let me put it another way,' said Mr Mulliner, patiently. 'Do you\r\nbelieve in haunted houses? Do you believe that it is possible for a\r\nmalign influence to envelop a place and work a spell on all who come\r\nwithin its radius?'\r\n\r\nI hesitated.\r\n\r\n'Well, no--and yes.'\r\n\r\nMr Mulliner sighed a little. He seemed to be wondering if I was always\r\nas bright as this.\r\n\r\n'Of course,' I went on, 'one has read stories. Henry James's _Turn of\r\nThe Screw_....'\r\n\r\n'I am not talking about fiction.'\r\n\r\n'Well, in real life--Well, look here, I once, as a matter of fact, did\r\nmeet a man who knew a fellow....'\r\n\r\n'My distant cousin James Rodman spent some weeks in a haunted house,'\r\nsaid Mr Mulliner, who, if he has a fault, is not a very good listener.\r\n'It cost him five thousand pounds. That is to say, he sacrificed five\r\nthousand pounds by not remaining there. Did you ever,' he asked,\r\nwandering, it seemed to me, from the subject, 'hear of Leila J.\r\nPinckney?'\r\n\r\nNaturally I had heard of Leila J. Pinckney. Her death some years ago\r\nhas diminished her vogue, but at one time it was impossible to pass\r\na bookshop or a railway bookstall without seeing a long row of her\r\nnovels. I have never myself actually read any of them, but I knew that\r\nin her particular line of literature, the Squashily Sentimental, she\r\nhad always been regarded by those entitled to judge as pre-eminent. The\r\ncritics usually headed their reviews of her stories with the words:\r\n\r\n                           ANOTHER PINCKNEY\r\n\r\nor sometimes, more offensively:\r\n\r\n                          ANOTHER PINCKNEY!!!\r\n\r\nAnd once, dealing with, I think, _The Love Which Prevails_, the\r\nliterary expert of the _Scrutinizer_ had compressed his entire\r\ncritique into the single phrase 'Oh, God!'\r\n\r\n'Of course,' I said. 'But what about her?'\r\n\r\n'She was James Rodman's aunt.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'And when she died James found that she had left him five thousand\r\npounds and the house in the country where she had lived for the last\r\ntwenty years of her life.'\r\n\r\n'A very nice little legacy.'\r\n\r\n'Twenty years,' repeated Mr Mulliner. 'Grasp that, for it has a vital\r\nbearing on what follows. Twenty years, mind you, and Miss Pinckney\r\nturned out two novels and twelve short stories regularly every\r\nyear besides a monthly page of Advice to Young Girls in one of the\r\nmagazines. That is to say, forty of her novels and no fewer than two\r\nhundred and forty of her short stories were written under the roof of\r\nHoneysuckle Cottage.'\r\n\r\n'A pretty name.'\r\n\r\n'A nasty, sloppy name,' said Mr Mulliner severely, 'which should have\r\nwarned my distant cousin James from the start. Have you a pencil and\r\na piece of paper?' He scribbled for a while, poring frowningly over\r\ncolumns of figures. 'Yes,' he said, looking up, 'if my calculations\r\nare correct, Leila J. Pinckney wrote in all a matter of nine million\r\none hundred and forty thousand words of glutinous sentimentality at\r\nHoneysuckle Cottage, and it was a condition of her will that James\r\nshould reside there for six months in every year. Failing to do this,\r\nhe was to forfeit the five thousand pounds.'\r\n\r\n'It must be great fun making a freak will,' I mused. 'I often wish I\r\nwas rich enough to do it.'\r\n\r\n'This was not a freak will. The conditions are perfectly\r\nunderstandable. James Rodman was a writer of sensational mystery\r\nstories, and his aunt Leila had always disapproved of his work. She\r\nwas a great believer in the influence of environment, and the reason\r\nwhy she inserted that clause in her will was that she wished to compel\r\nJames to move from London to the country. She considered that living\r\nin London hardened him and made his outlook on life sordid. She often\r\nasked him if he thought it quite nice to harp so much on sudden death\r\nand blackmailers with squints. Surely, she said, there were enough\r\nsquinting blackmailers in the world without writing about them.\r\n\r\n'The fact that Literature meant such different things to these two\r\nhad, I believe, caused something of a coolness between them, and James\r\nhad never dreamed that he would be remembered in his aunt's will. For\r\nhe had never concealed his opinion that Leila J. Pinckney's style of\r\nwriting revolted him, however dear it might be to her enormous public.\r\nHe held rigid views on the art of the novel, and always maintained that\r\nan artist with a true reverence for his craft should not descend to\r\ngoo-ey love stories, but should stick austerely to revolvers, cries in\r\nthe night, missing papers, mysterious Chinamen, and dead bodies--with\r\nor without gash in throat. And not even the thought that his aunt\r\nhad dandled him on her knee as a baby could induce him to stifle his\r\nliterary conscience to the extent of pretending to enjoy her work.\r\nFirst, last, and all the time, James Rodman had held the opinion--and\r\nvoiced it fearlessly--that Leila J. Pinckney wrote bilge.\r\n\r\n'It was a surprise to him, therefore, to find that he had been left\r\nthis legacy. A pleasant surprise, of course. James was making quite a\r\ndecent income out of the three novels and eighteen short stories which\r\nhe produced annually, but an author can always find a use for five\r\nthousand pounds. And, as for the cottage, he had actually been looking\r\nabout for a little place in the country at the very moment when he\r\nreceived the lawyer's letter. In less than a week he was installed at\r\nhis new residence.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJames's first impressions of Honeysuckle Cottage were, he tells me,\r\nwholly favourable. He was delighted with the place. It was a low,\r\nrambling, picturesque old house with funny little chimneys and a red\r\nroof, placed in the middle of the most charming country. With its oak\r\nbeams, its trim garden, its trilling birds and its rose-hung porch,\r\nit was the ideal spot for a writer. It was just the sort of place, he\r\nreflected whimsically, which his aunt had loved to write about in her\r\nbooks. Even the apple-cheeked old housekeeper who attended to his needs\r\nmight have stepped straight out of one of them.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to James that his lot had been cast in pleasant places. He\r\nhad brought down his books, his pipes, and his golf-clubs, and was\r\nhard at work finishing the best thing he had ever done. _The Secret\r\nNine_ was the title of it; and on the beautiful summer afternoon\r\non which this story opens he was in the study, hammering away at his\r\ntypewriter, at peace with the world. The machine was running sweetly,\r\nthe new tobacco he had bought the day before was proving admirable, and\r\nhe was moving on all six cylinders to the end of a chapter.\r\n\r\nHe shoved in a fresh sheet of paper, chewed his pipe thoughtfully for a\r\nmoment, then wrote rapidly:\r\n\r\n    For an instant Lester Gage thought that he must have been mistaken.\r\n    Then the noise came again, faint but unmistakable--a soft\r\n    scratching on the outer panel.\r\n\r\n    His mouth set in a grim line. Silently, like a panther, he made one\r\n    quick step to the desk, noiselessly opened a drawer, drew out his\r\n    automatic. After that affair of the poisoned needle, he was taking\r\n    no chances. Still in dead silence, he tiptoed to the door; then,\r\n    flinging it suddenly open, he stood there, his weapon poised.\r\n\r\n    On the mat stood the most beautiful girl he had ever beheld. A\r\n    veritable child of Faërie. She eyed him for a moment with a saucy\r\n    smile; then with a pretty, roguish look of reproof shook a dainty\r\n    forefinger at him.\r\n\r\n    'I believe you've forgotten me, Mr Gage!' she fluted with a mock\r\n    severity which her eyes belied.\r\n\r\nJames stared at the paper dumbly. He was utterly perplexed. He had not\r\nhad the slightest intention of writing anything like this. To begin\r\nwith, it was a rule with him, and one which he never broke, to allow no\r\ngirls to appear in his stories. Sinister landladies, yes, and naturally\r\nany amount of adventuresses with foreign accents, but never under any\r\npretext what may be broadly described as girls. A detective story, he\r\nmaintained, should have no heroine. Heroines only held up the action\r\nand tried to flirt with the hero when he should have been busy looking\r\nfor clues, and then went and let the villain kidnap them by some\r\nchildishly simple trick. In his writing, James was positively monastic.\r\n\r\nAnd yet here was this creature with her saucy smile and her dainty\r\nforefinger horning in at the most important point in the story. It was\r\nuncanny.\r\n\r\nHe looked once more at his scenario. No, the scenario was all right.\r\n\r\nIn perfectly plain words it stated that what happened when the\r\ndoor opened was that a dying man fell in and after gasping, 'The\r\nbeetle! Tell Scotland Yard that the blue beetle is--' expired on the\r\nhearth-rug, leaving Lester Gage not unnaturally somewhat mystified.\r\nNothing whatever about any beautiful girls.\r\n\r\nIn a curious mood of irritation, James scratched out the offending\r\npassage, wrote in the necessary corrections and put the cover on the\r\nmachine. It was at this point that he heard William whining.\r\n\r\nThe only blot on this paradise which James had so far been able\r\nto discover was the infernal dog, William. Belonging nominally to\r\nthe gardener, on the very first morning he had adopted James by\r\nacclamation, and he maddened and infuriated James. He had a habit\r\nof coming and whining under the window when James was at work. The\r\nlatter would ignore this as long as he could; then, when the thing\r\nbecame insupportable, would bound out of his chair, to see the animal\r\nstanding on the gravel, gazing expectantly up at him with a stone in\r\nhis mouth. William had a weak-minded passion for chasing stones; and\r\non the first day James, in a rash spirit of camaraderie, had flung one\r\nfor him. Since then James had thrown no more stones; but he had thrown\r\nany number of other solids, and the garden was littered with objects\r\nranging from match boxes to a plaster statuette of the young Joseph\r\nprophesying before Pharaoh. And still William came and whined, an\r\noptimist to the last.\r\n\r\nThe whining, coming now at a moment when he felt irritable and\r\nunsettled, acted on James much as the scratching on the door had acted\r\non Lester Gage. Silently, like a panther, he made one quick step to the\r\nmantelpiece, removed from it a china mug bearing the legend A Present\r\nFrom Clacton-on-Sea, and crept to the window.\r\n\r\nAnd as he did so a voice outside said, 'Go away, sir, go away!' and\r\nthere followed a short, high-pitched bark which was certainly not\r\nWilliam's. William was a mixture of airedale, setter, bull terrier,\r\nand mastiff; and when in vocal mood, favoured the mastiff side of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nJames peered out. There on the porch stood a girl in blue. She held in\r\nher arms a small fluffy white dog, and she was endeavouring to foil\r\nthe upward movement toward this of the blackguard William. William's\r\nmentality had been arrested some years before at the point where he\r\nimagined that everything in the world had been created for him to eat.\r\nA bone, a boot, a steak, the back wheel of a bicycle--it was all one to\r\nWilliam. If it was there he tried to eat it. He had even made a plucky\r\nattempt to devour the remains of the young Joseph prophesying before\r\nPharaoh. And it was perfectly plain now that he regarded the curious\r\nwriggling object in the girl's arms purely in the light of a snack to\r\nkeep body and soul together till dinner-time.\r\n\r\n'William!' bellowed James.\r\n\r\nWilliam looked courteously over his shoulder with eyes that beamed with\r\nthe pure light of a life's devotion, wagged the whiplike tail which he\r\nhad inherited from his bull-terrier ancestor, and resumed his intent\r\nscrutiny of the fluffy dog.\r\n\r\n'Oh, please!' cried the girl. 'This great rough dog is frightening poor\r\nToto.'\r\n\r\nThe man of letters and the man of action do not always go hand in\r\nhand, but practice had made James perfect in handling with a swift\r\nefficiency any situation that involved William. A moment later that\r\ncanine moron, having received the present from Clacton in the short\r\nribs, was scuttling round the corner of the house, and James had jumped\r\nthrough the window and was facing the girl.\r\n\r\nShe was an extraordinarily pretty girl. Very sweet and fragile she\r\nlooked as she stood there under the honeysuckle with the breeze\r\nruffling a tendril of golden hair that strayed from beneath her\r\ncoquettish little hat. Her eyes were very big and very blue, her\r\nrose-tinted face becomingly flushed. All wasted on James, though. He\r\ndisliked all girls, and particularly the sweet, droopy type.\r\n\r\n'Did you want to see somebody?' he asked stiffly.\r\n\r\n'Just the house,' said the girl, 'if it wouldn't be giving any trouble.\r\nI do so want to see the room where Miss Pinckney wrote her books. This\r\nis where Leila J. Pinckney used to live, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I am her nephew. My name is James Rodman.'\r\n\r\n'Mine is Rose Maynard.'\r\n\r\nJames led the way into the house, and she stopped with a cry of delight\r\non the threshold of the morning-room.\r\n\r\n'Oh, how too perfect!' she cried. 'So this was her study?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'What a wonderful place it would be for you to think in if you were a\r\nwriter too.'\r\n\r\nJames held no high opinion of women's literary taste, but nevertheless\r\nhe was conscious of an unpleasant shock.\r\n\r\n'I am a writer,' he said coldly. 'I write detective stories.'\r\n\r\n'I--I'm afraid,'--she blushed--'I'm afraid I don't often read detective\r\nstories.'\r\n\r\n'You no doubt prefer,' said James, still more coldly, 'the sort of\r\nthing my aunt used to write.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I love her stories!' cried the girl, clasping her hands\r\necstatically. 'Don't you?'\r\n\r\n'I cannot say that I do.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'They are pure apple sauce,' said James sternly; 'just nasty blobs of\r\nsentimentality, thoroughly untrue to life.'\r\n\r\nThe girl stared.\r\n\r\n'Why, that's just what's so wonderful about them, their trueness to\r\nlife! You feel they might all have happened. I don't understand what\r\nyou mean.'\r\n\r\nThey were walking down the garden now. James held the gate open for her\r\nand she passed through into the road.\r\n\r\n'Well, for one thing,' he said, 'I decline to believe that a marriage\r\nbetween two young people is invariably preceded by some violent and\r\nsensational experience in which they both share.'\r\n\r\n'Are you thinking of _Scent o' the Blossom_, where Edgar saves\r\nMaud from drowning?'\r\n\r\n'I am thinking of every single one of my aunt's books.' He looked at\r\nher curiously. He had just got the solution of a mystery which had been\r\npuzzling him for some time. Almost from the moment he had set eyes on\r\nher she had seemed somehow strangely familiar. It now suddenly came to\r\nhim why it was that he disliked her so much. 'Do you know,' he said,\r\n'you might be one of my aunt's heroines yourself? You're just the sort\r\nof girl she used to love to write about.'\r\n\r\nHer face lit up.\r\n\r\n'Oh, do you really think so?' She hesitated. 'Do you know what I have\r\nbeen feeling ever since I came here? I've been feeling that you are\r\nexactly like one of Miss Pinckney's heroes.'\r\n\r\n'No, I say, really!' said James, revolted.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but you are! When you jumped through that window it gave me quite\r\na start. You were so exactly like Claude Masterton in _Heather o' the\r\nHills_.'\r\n\r\n'I have not read _Heather o' the Hills_,' said James, with a\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\n'He was very strong and quiet, with deep, dark, sad eyes.'\r\n\r\nJames did not explain that his eyes were sad because her society gave\r\nhim a pain in the neck. He merely laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n'So now, I suppose,' he said, 'a car will come and knock you down and I\r\nshall carry you gently into the house and lay you--Look out!' he cried.\r\n\r\nIt was too late. She was lying in a little huddled heap at his feet.\r\nRound the corner a large automobile had come bowling, keeping with\r\nan almost affected precision to the wrong side of the road. It was\r\nnow receding into the distance, the occupant of the tonneau, a stout\r\nred-faced gentleman in a fur coat, leaning out over the back. He had\r\nbared his head--not, one fears, as a pretty gesture of respect and\r\nregret, but because he was using his hat to hide the number plate.\r\n\r\nThe dog Toto was unfortunately uninjured.\r\n\r\nJames carried the girl gently into the house and laid her on the sofa\r\nin the morning-room. He rang the bell and the apple-cheeked housekeeper\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n'Send for the doctor,' said James. 'There has been an accident.'\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper bent over the girl.\r\n\r\n'Eh, dearie, dearie!' she said. 'Bless her sweet pretty face!'\r\n\r\nThe gardener, he who technically owned William, was routed out from\r\namong the young lettuces and told to fetch Dr Brady. He separated his\r\nbicycle from William, who was making a light meal off the left pedal,\r\nand departed on his mission. Dr Brady arrived and in due course he made\r\nhis report.\r\n\r\n'No bones broken, but a number of nasty bruises. And, of course, the\r\nshock. She will have to stay here for some time, Rodman. Can't be\r\nmoved.'\r\n\r\n'Stay here! But she can't! It isn't proper.'\r\n\r\n'Your housekeeper will act as a chaperon.'\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed. He was a stolid-looking man of middle age with side\r\nwhiskers.\r\n\r\n'A beautiful girl, that, Rodman,' he said.\r\n\r\n'I suppose so,' said James.\r\n\r\n'A sweet, beautiful girl. An elfin child.'\r\n\r\n'A what?' cried James, starting.\r\n\r\nThis imagery was very foreign to Dr Brady as he knew him. On the only\r\nprevious occasion on which they had had any extended conversation, the\r\ndoctor had talked exclusively about the effect of too much protein on\r\nthe gastric juices.\r\n\r\n'An elfin child; a tender, fairy creature. When I was looking at her\r\njust now, Rodman, I nearly broke down. Her little hand lay on the\r\ncoverlet like some white lily floating on the surface of a still pool,\r\nand her dear, trusting eyes gazed up at me.'\r\n\r\nHe pottered off down the garden, still babbling, and James stood\r\nstaring after him blankly. And slowly, like some cloud athwart a summer\r\nsky, there crept over James's heart the chill shadow of a nameless fear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was about a week later that Mr Andrew McKinnon, the senior partner\r\nin the well-known firm of literary agents, McKinnon & Gooch, sat in his\r\noffice in Chancery Lane, frowning thoughtfully over a telegram. He rang\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\n'Ask Mr Gooch to step in here.' He resumed his study of the telegram.\r\n'Oh, Gooch,' he said when his partner appeared, 'I've just had a\r\ncurious wire from young Rodman. He seems to want to see me very\r\nurgently.'\r\n\r\nMr Gooch read the telegram.\r\n\r\n'Written under the influence of some strong mental excitement,' he\r\nagreed. 'I wonder why he doesn't come to the office if he wants to see\r\nyou so badly.'\r\n\r\n'He's working very hard, finishing that novel for Prodder & Wiggs.\r\nCan't leave it, I suppose. Well, it's a nice day. If you will look\r\nafter things here I think I'll motor down and let him give me lunch.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Mr McKinnon's car reached the crossroads a mile from Honeysuckle\r\nCottage, he was aware of a gesticulating figure by the hedge. He\r\nstopped the car.\r\n\r\n'Morning, Rodman.'\r\n\r\n'Thank God, you've come!' said James. It seemed to Mr McKinnon that the\r\nyoung man looked paler and thinner. 'Would you mind walking the rest of\r\nthe way? There's something I want to speak to you about.'\r\n\r\nMr McKinnon alighted; and James, as he glanced at him, felt cheered\r\nand encouraged by the very sight of the man. The literary agent was a\r\ngrim, hard-bitten person, to whom, when he called at their offices to\r\narrange terms, editors kept their faces turned so that they might at\r\nleast retain their back collar studs. There was no sentiment in Andrew\r\nMcKinnon. Editresses of society papers practised their blandishments on\r\nhim in vain, and many a publisher had waked screaming in the night,\r\ndreaming that he was signing a McKinnon contract.\r\n\r\n'Well, Rodman,' he said, 'Prodder & Wiggs have agreed to our terms.\r\nI was writing to tell you so when your wire arrived. I had a lot\r\nof trouble with them, but it's fixed at twenty per cent, rising to\r\ntwenty-five, and two hundred pounds advance royalties on day of\r\npublication.'\r\n\r\n'Good!' said James absently. 'Good! McKinnon, do you remember my aunt,\r\nLeila J. Pinckney?'\r\n\r\n'Remember her? Why, I was her agent all her life.'\r\n\r\n'Of course. Then you know the sort of tripe she wrote.'\r\n\r\n'No author,' said Mr McKinnon reprovingly, 'who pulls down a steady\r\ntwenty thousand pounds a year writes tripe.'\r\n\r\n'Well anyway, you know her stuff.'\r\n\r\n'Who better?'\r\n\r\n'When she died she left me five thousand pounds and her house,\r\nHoneysuckle Cottage. I'm living there now. McKinnon, do you believe in\r\nhaunted houses?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Yet I tell you solemnly that Honeysuckle Cottage is haunted!'\r\n\r\n'By your aunt?' said Mr McKinnon, surprised.\r\n\r\n'By her influence. There's a malignant spell over the place; a sort of\r\nmiasma of sentimentalism. Everybody who enters it succumbs.'\r\n\r\n'Tut-tut! You mustn't have these fancies.'\r\n\r\n'They aren't fancies.'\r\n\r\n'You aren't seriously meaning to tell me--'\r\n\r\n'Well, how do you account for this? That book you were speaking about,\r\nwhich Prodder & Wiggs are to publish--_The Secret Nine_. Every\r\ntime I sit down to write it a girl keeps trying to sneak in.'\r\n\r\n'Into the room?'\r\n\r\n'Into the story.'\r\n\r\n'You don't want a love interest in your sort of book,' said Mr\r\nMcKinnon, shaking his head. 'It delays the action.'\r\n\r\n'I know it does. And every day I have to keep shooing this infernal\r\nfemale out. An awful girl, McKinnon. A soppy, soupy, treacly, drooping\r\ngirl with a roguish smile. This morning she tried to butt in on the\r\nscene where Lester Gage is trapped in the den of the mysterious leper.'\r\n\r\n'No!'\r\n\r\n'She did, I assure you. I had to rewrite three pages before I could\r\nget her out of it. And that's not the worst. Do you know, McKinnon,\r\nthat at this moment I am actually living the plot of a typical Leila\r\nJ. Pinckney novel in just the setting she always used! And I can see\r\nthe happy ending coming nearer every day! A week ago a girl was knocked\r\ndown by a car at my door and I've had to put her up, and every day I\r\nrealize more clearly that sooner or later I shall ask her to marry me.'\r\n\r\n'Don't do it,' said Mr McKinnon, a stout bachelor. 'You're too young to\r\nmarry.'\r\n\r\n'So was Methuselah,' said James, a stouter. 'But all the same I know\r\nI'm going to do it. It's the influence of this awful house weighing\r\nupon me. I feel like an eggshell in a maelstrom. I am being sucked on\r\nby a force too strong for me to resist. This morning I found myself\r\nkissing her dog!'\r\n\r\n'No!'\r\n\r\n'I did! And I loathe the little beast. Yesterday I got up at dawn and\r\nplucked a nosegay of flowers for her, wet with the dew.'\r\n\r\n'Rodman!'\r\n\r\n'It's a fact. I laid them at her door and went downstairs kicking\r\nmyself all the way. And there in the hall was the apple-cheeked\r\nhousekeeper regarding me archly. If she didn't murmur \"Bless their\r\nsweet young hearts!\" my ears deceived me.'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you pack up and leave?'\r\n\r\n'If I do I lose the five thousand pounds.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Mr McKinnon.\r\n\r\n'I can understand what has happened. It's the same with all haunted\r\nhouses. My aunt's subliminal ether vibrations have woven themselves\r\ninto the texture of the place, creating an atmosphere which forces the\r\nego of all who come in contact with it to attune themselves to it. It's\r\neither that or something to do with the fourth dimension.'\r\n\r\nMr McKinnon laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n'Tut-tut!' he said again. 'This is pure imagination. What has happened\r\nis that you've been working too hard. You'll see this precious\r\natmosphere of yours will have no effect on me.'\r\n\r\n'That's exactly why I asked you to come down. I hoped you might break\r\nthe spell.'\r\n\r\n'I will that,' said Mr McKinnon jovially.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the literary agent spoke little at lunch caused James\r\nno apprehension. Mr McKinnon was ever a silent trencherman. From time\r\nto time James caught him stealing a glance at the girl, who was well\r\nenough to come down to meals now, limping pathetically; but he could\r\nread nothing in his face. And yet the mere look of his face was a\r\nconsolation. It was so solid, so matter of fact, so exactly like an\r\nunemotional coconut.\r\n\r\n'You've done me good,' said James with a sigh of relief, as he escorted\r\nthe agent down the garden to his car after lunch. 'I felt all along\r\nthat I could rely on your rugged common sense. The whole atmosphere of\r\nthe place seems different now.'\r\n\r\nMr McKinnon did not speak for a moment. He seemed to be plunged in\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n'Rodman,' he said, as he got into his car, 'I've been thinking over\r\nthat suggestion of yours of putting a love interest into _The Secret\r\nNine_. I think you're wise. The story needs it. After all, what\r\nis there greater in the world than love? Love--love--aye, it's the\r\nsweetest word in the language. Put in a heroine and let her marry\r\nLester Gage.'\r\n\r\n'If,' said James grimly, 'she does succeed in worming her way in\r\nshe'll jolly well marry the mysterious leper. But look here, I don't\r\nunderstand--'\r\n\r\n'It was seeing that girl that changed me,' proceeded Mr McKinnon. And\r\nas James stared at him aghast, tears suddenly filled his hard-boiled\r\neyes. He openly snuffled. 'Aye, seeing her sitting there under the\r\nroses, with all that smell of honeysuckle and all. And the birdies\r\nsinging so sweet in the garden and the sun lighting up her bonny face.\r\nThe puir wee lass!' he muttered, dabbing at his eyes. 'The puir bonny\r\nwee lass! Rodman,' he said, his voice quivering, 'I've decided that\r\nwe're being hard on Prodder & Wiggs. Wiggs has had sickness in his home\r\nlately. We mustn't be hard on a man who's had sickness in his home,\r\nhey, laddie? No, no! I'm going to take back that contract and alter it\r\nto a flat twelve per cent and no advance royalties.'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'But you shan't lose by it, Rodman. No, no, you shan't lose by it, my\r\nmanny. I am going to waive my commission. The puir bonny wee lass!'\r\n\r\nThe car rolled off down the road. Mr McKinnon, seated in the back, was\r\nblowing his nose violently.\r\n\r\n'This is the end!' said James.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is necessary at this point to pause and examine James Rodman's\r\nposition with an unbiased eye. The average man, unless he puts himself\r\nin James's place, will be unable to appreciate it. James, he will feel,\r\nwas making a lot of fuss about nothing. Here he was, drawing daily\r\ncloser and closer to a charming girl with big blue eyes, and surely\r\nrather to be envied than pitied.\r\n\r\nBut we must remember that James was one of Nature's bachelors. And\r\nno ordinary man, looking forward dreamily to a little home of his\r\nown with a loving wife putting out his slippers and changing the\r\ngramophone records, can realize the intensity of the instinct for\r\nself-preservation which animates Nature's bachelors in times of peril.\r\n\r\nJames Rodman had a congenital horror of matrimony. Though a young man,\r\nhe had allowed himself to develop a great many habits which were as the\r\nbreath of life to him; and these habits, he knew instinctively, a wife\r\nwould shoot to pieces within a week of the end of the honeymoon.\r\n\r\nJames liked to breakfast in bed; and, having breakfasted, to smoke in\r\nbed and knock the ashes out on the carpet. What wife would tolerate\r\nthis practice?\r\n\r\nJames liked to pass his days in a tennis shirt, grey flannel trousers,\r\nand slippers. What wife ever rests until she has inclosed her husband\r\nin a stiff collar, tight boots, and a morning suit and taken him with\r\nher to _thés musicaux_?\r\n\r\nThese and a thousand other thoughts of the same kind flashed through\r\nthe unfortunate young man's mind as the days went by, and every day\r\nthat passed seemed to draw him nearer to the brink of the chasm.\r\nFate appeared to be taking a malicious pleasure in making things as\r\ndifficult for him as possible. Now that the girl was well enough\r\nto leave her bed, she spent her time sitting in a chair on the\r\nsun-sprinkled porch, and James had to read to her--and poetry, at\r\nthat; and not the jolly, wholesome sort of poetry the boys are turning\r\nout nowadays, either--good, honest stuff about sin and gas-works and\r\ndecaying corpses--but the old-fashioned kind with rhymes in it, dealing\r\nalmost exclusively with love. The weather, moreover, continued superb.\r\nThe honeysuckle cast its sweet scent on the gentle breeze; the roses\r\nover the porch stirred and nodded; the flowers in the garden were\r\nlovelier than ever; the birds sang their little throats sore. And every\r\nevening there was a magnificent sunset. It was almost as if Nature were\r\ndoing it on purpose.\r\n\r\nAt last James intercepted Dr Brady as he was leaving after one of his\r\nvisits and put the thing to him squarely:\r\n\r\n'When is that girl going?'\r\n\r\nThe doctor patted him on the arm.\r\n\r\n'Not yet, Rodman,' he said in a low, understanding voice. 'No need\r\nto worry yourself about that. Mustn't be moved for days and days and\r\ndays--I might almost say weeks and weeks and weeks.'\r\n\r\n'Weeks and weeks!' cried James.\r\n\r\n'And weeks,' said Dr Brady. He prodded James roguishly in the abdomen.\r\n'Good luck to you, my boy, good luck to you,' he said.\r\n\r\nIt was some small consolation to James that the mushy physician\r\nimmediately afterward tripped over William on his way down the path and\r\nbroke his stethoscope. When a man is up against it like James every\r\nlittle helps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was walking dismally back to the house after this conversation when\r\nhe was met by the apple-cheeked housekeeper.\r\n\r\n'The little lady would like to speak to you, sir,' said the\r\napple-cheeked exhibit, rubbing her hands.\r\n\r\n'Would she?' said James hollowly.\r\n\r\n'So sweet and pretty she looks, sir--oh, sir, you wouldn't believe!\r\nLike a blessed angel sitting there with her dear eyes all a-shining.'\r\n\r\n'Don't do it!' cried James with extraordinary vehemence. 'Don't do it!'\r\n\r\nHe found the girl propped up on the cushions and thought once again\r\nhow singularly he disliked her. And yet, even as he thought this, some\r\nforce against which he had to fight madly was whispering to him, 'Go\r\nto her and take that little hand! Breathe into that little ear the\r\nburning words that will make that little face turn away crimsoned with\r\nblushes!' He wiped a bead of perspiration from his forehead and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n'Mrs Stick-in-the-Mud--what's her name?--says you want to see me.'\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded.\r\n\r\n'I've had a letter from Uncle Henry. I wrote to him as soon as I was\r\nbetter and told him what had happened, and he is coming here tomorrow\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\n'Uncle Henry?'\r\n\r\n'That's what I call him, but he's really no relation. He is my\r\nguardian. He and daddy were officers in the same regiment, and when\r\ndaddy was killed, fighting on the Afghan frontier, he died in Uncle\r\nHenry's arms and with his last breath begged him to take care of me.'\r\n\r\nJames started. A sudden wild hope had waked in his heart. Years ago,\r\nhe remembered, he had read a book of his aunt's entitled _Rupert's\r\nLegacy_, and in that book--\r\n\r\n'I'm engaged to marry him,' said the girl quietly.\r\n\r\n'Wow!' shouted James.\r\n\r\n'What?' asked the girl, startled.\r\n\r\n'Touch of cramp,' said James. He was thrilling all over. That wild hope\r\nhad been realized.\r\n\r\n'It was daddy's dying wish that we should marry,' said the girl.\r\n\r\n'And dashed sensible of him, too; dashed sensible,' said James warmly.\r\n\r\n'And yet,' she went on, a little wistfully, 'I sometimes wonder--'\r\n\r\n'Don't!' said James. 'Don't! You must respect daddy's dying wish.\r\nThere's nothing like daddy's dying wish; you can't beat it. So he's\r\ncoming here tomorrow, is he? Capital, capital. To lunch, I suppose?\r\nExcellent! I'll run down and tell Mrs Who-Is-It to lay in another chop.'\r\n\r\nIt was with a gay and uplifted heart that James strolled the garden\r\nand smoked his pipe next morning. A great cloud seemed to have rolled\r\nitself away from him. Everything was for the best in the best of all\r\npossible worlds. He had finished _The Secret Nine_ and shipped it\r\noff to Mr McKinnon, and now as he strolled there was shaping itself in\r\nhis mind a corking plot about a man with only half a face who lived in\r\na secret den and terrorized London with a series of shocking murders.\r\nAnd what made them so shocking was the fact that each of the victims,\r\nwhen discovered, was found to have only half a face too. The rest had\r\nbeen chipped off, presumably by some blunt instrument.\r\n\r\nThe thing was coming out magnificently, when suddenly his attention was\r\ndiverted by a piercing scream. Out of the bushes fringing the river\r\nthat ran beside the garden burst the apple-cheeked housekeeper.\r\n\r\n'Oh, sir! Oh, sir! Oh, sir!'\r\n\r\n'What is it?' demanded James irritably.\r\n\r\n'Oh, sir! Oh, sir! Oh, sir!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, and then what?'\r\n\r\n'The little dog, sir! He's in the river!'\r\n\r\n'Well, whistle him to come out.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, sir, do come quick! He'll be drowned!'\r\n\r\nJames followed her through the bushes, taking off his coat as he went.\r\nHe was saying to himself, 'I will not rescue this dog. I do not like\r\nthe dog. It is high time he had a bath, and in any case it would be\r\nmuch simpler to stand on the bank and fish for him with a rake. Only an\r\nass out of a Leila J. Pinckney book would dive into a beastly river to\r\nsave--'\r\n\r\nAt this point he dived. Toto, alarmed by the splash, swam rapidly for\r\nthe bank, but James was too quick for him. Grasping him firmly by\r\nthe neck, he scrambled ashore and ran for the house, followed by the\r\nhousekeeper.\r\n\r\nThe girl was seated on the porch. Over her there bent the tall\r\nsoldierly figure of a man with keen eyes and greying hair. The\r\nhousekeeper raced up.\r\n\r\n'Oh, miss! Toto! In the river! He saved him! He plunged in and saved\r\nhim!'\r\n\r\nThe girl drew a quick breath.\r\n\r\n'Gallant, damme! By Jove! By gad! Yes, gallant, by George!' exclaimed\r\nthe soldierly man.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed to wake from a reverie.\r\n\r\n'Uncle Henry, this is Mr Rodman. Mr Rodman, my guardian, Colonel\r\nCarteret.'\r\n\r\n'Proud to meet you, sir,' said the colonel, his honest blue eyes\r\nglowing as he fingered his short crisp moustache. 'As fine a thing as I\r\never heard of, damme!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you are brave--brave,' the girl whispered.\r\n\r\n'I am wet--wet,' said James, and went upstairs to change his clothes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he came down for lunch, he found to his relief that the girl\r\nhad decided not to join them, and Colonel Carteret was silent and\r\npreoccupied. James, exerting himself in his capacity of host, tried\r\nhim with the weather, golf, India, the Government, the high cost of\r\nliving, first-class cricket, the modern dancing craze, and murderers\r\nhe had met, but the other still preserved that strange, absent-minded\r\nsilence. It was only when the meal was concluded and James had produced\r\ncigarettes that he came abruptly out of his trance.\r\n\r\n'Rodman,' he said, 'I should like to speak to you.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?' said James, thinking it was about time.\r\n\r\n'Rodman,' said Colonel Carteret, 'or rather, George--I may call you\r\nGeorge?' he added, with a sort of wistful diffidence that had a\r\nsingular charm.\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' replied James, 'if you wish it. Though my name is James.'\r\n\r\n'James, eh? Well, well, it amounts to the same thing, eh, what,\r\ndamme, by gad?' said the colonel with a momentary return of his bluff\r\nsoldierly manner. 'Well, then, James, I have something that I wish to\r\nsay to you. Did Miss Maynard--did Rose happen to tell you anything\r\nabout myself in--er--in connexion with herself?'\r\n\r\n'She mentioned that you and she were engaged to be married.'\r\n\r\nThe colonel's tightly drawn lips quivered.\r\n\r\n'No longer,' he said.\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'No, John, my boy.'\r\n\r\n'James.'\r\n\r\n'No, James, my boy, no longer. While you were upstairs changing your\r\nclothes she told me--breaking down, poor child, as she spoke--that she\r\nwished our engagement to be at an end.'\r\n\r\nJames half rose from the table, his cheeks blanched.\r\n\r\n'You don't mean that!' he gasped.\r\n\r\nColonel Carteret nodded. He was staring out of the window, his fine\r\neyes set in a look of pain.\r\n\r\n'But this is nonsense!' cried James. 'This is absurd! She--she mustn't\r\nbe allowed to chop and change like this. I mean to say, it--it isn't\r\nfair--'\r\n\r\n'Don't think of me, my boy.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not--I mean, did she give any reason?'\r\n\r\n'Her eyes did.'\r\n\r\n'Her eyes did?'\r\n\r\n'Her eyes, when she looked at you on the porch, as you stood\r\nthere--young, heroic--having just saved the life of the dog she loves.\r\nIt is you who have won that tender heart, my boy.'\r\n\r\n'Now, listen,' protested James, 'you aren't going to sit there and tell\r\nme that a girl falls in love with a man just because he saves her dog\r\nfrom drowning?'\r\n\r\n'Why, surely,' said Colonel Carteret, surprised. 'What better reason\r\ncould she have?' He sighed. 'It is the old, old story, my boy.\r\nYouth to youth. I am an old man. I should have known--I should have\r\nforeseen--yes, youth to youth.'\r\n\r\n'You aren't a bit old.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes.'\r\n\r\n'No, no.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes.'\r\n\r\n'Don't keep on saying yes, yes!' cried James, clutching at his hair.\r\n'Besides, she wants a steady old buffer--a steady, sensible man of\r\nmedium age--to look after her.'\r\n\r\nColonel Carteret shook his head with a gentle smile.\r\n\r\n'This is mere quixotry, my boy. It is splendid of you to take this\r\nattitude; but no, no.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes.'\r\n\r\n'No, no.' He gripped James's hand for an instant, then rose and walked\r\nto the door. 'That is all I wished to say, Tom.'\r\n\r\n'James.'\r\n\r\n'James. I just thought that you ought to know how matters stood. Go\r\nto her, my boy, go to her, and don't let any thought of an old man's\r\nbroken dream keep you from pouring out what is in your heart. I am an\r\nold soldier, lad, an old soldier. I have learned to take the rough\r\nwith the smooth. But I think--I think I will leave you now. I--I\r\nshould--should like to be alone for a while. If you need me you will\r\nfind me in the raspberry bushes.'\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely gone when James also left the room. He took his hat\r\nand stick and walked blindly out of the garden, he knew not whither.\r\nHis brain was numbed. Then, as his powers of reasoning returned, he\r\ntold himself that he should have foreseen this ghastly thing. If there\r\nwas one type of character over which Leila J. Pinckney had been wont\r\nto spread herself, it was the pathetic guardian who loves his ward but\r\nrelinquishes her to the younger man. No wonder the girl had broken off\r\nthe engagement. Any elderly guardian who allowed himself to come within\r\na mile of Honeysuckle Cottage was simply asking for it. And then, as\r\nhe turned to walk back, a dull defiance gripped James. Why, he asked,\r\nshould he be put upon in this manner? If the girl liked to throw over\r\nthis man, why should he be the goat?\r\n\r\nHe saw his way clearly now. He just wouldn't do it, that was all. And\r\nif they didn't like it they could lump it.\r\n\r\nFull of a new fortitude, he strode in at the gate. A tall, soldierly\r\nfigure emerged from the raspberry bushes and came to meet him.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Colonel Carteret.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said James defiantly.\r\n\r\n'Am I to congratulate you?'\r\n\r\nJames caught his keen blue eye and hesitated. It was not going to be so\r\nsimple as he had supposed.\r\n\r\n'Well--er--' he said.\r\n\r\nInto the keen blue eyes there came a look that James had not seen there\r\nbefore. It was the stern, hard look which--probably--had caused men to\r\nbestow upon this old soldier the name of Cold-Steel Carteret.\r\n\r\n'You have not asked Rose to marry you?'\r\n\r\n'Er--no; not yet.'\r\n\r\nThe keen blue eyes grew keener and bluer.\r\n\r\n'Rodman,' said Colonel Carteret in a strange, quiet voice, 'I have\r\nknown that little girl since she was a tiny child. For years she has\r\nbeen all in all to me. Her father died in my arms and with his last\r\nbreath bade me see that no harm came to his darling. I have nursed her\r\nthrough mumps, measles--aye, and chicken pox--and I live but for her\r\nhappiness.' He paused, with a significance that made James's toes curl.\r\n'Rodman,' he said, 'do you know what I would do to any man who trifled\r\nwith that little girl's affections?' He reached in his hip pocket and\r\nan ugly-looking revolver glittered in the sunlight. 'I would shoot him\r\nlike a dog.'\r\n\r\n'Like a dog?' faltered James.\r\n\r\n'Like a dog,' said Colonel Carteret. He took James's arm and turned\r\nhim towards the house. 'She is on the porch. Go to her. And if--' He\r\nbroke off. 'But tut!' he said in a kindlier tone. 'I am doing you an\r\ninjustice, my boy. I know it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, you are,' said James fervently.\r\n\r\n'Your heart is in the right place.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, absolutely,' said James.\r\n\r\n'Then go to her, my boy. Later on you may have something to tell me.\r\nYou will find me in the strawberry beds.'\r\n\r\nIt was very cool and fragrant on the porch. Overhead, little breezes\r\nplayed and laughed among the roses. Somewhere in the distance sheep\r\nbells tinkled, and in the shrubbery a thrush was singing its evensong.\r\n\r\nSeated in her chair behind a wicker table laden with tea things, Rose\r\nMaynard watched James as he shambled up the path.\r\n\r\n'Tea's ready,' she called gaily. 'Where is Uncle Henry?' A look of pity\r\nand distress flitted for a moment over her flower-like face. 'Oh, I--I\r\nforgot,' she whispered.\r\n\r\n'He is in the strawberry beds,' said James in a low voice.\r\n\r\nShe nodded unhappily.\r\n\r\n'Of course, of course. Oh, why is life like this?' James heard her\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nHe sat down. He looked at the girl. She was leaning back with closed\r\neyes, and he thought he had never seen such a little squirt in his\r\nlife. The idea of passing his remaining days in her society revolted\r\nhim. He was stoutly opposed to the idea of marrying anyone; but if,\r\nas happens to the best of us, he ever were compelled to perform the\r\nwedding glide, he had always hoped it would be with some lady golf\r\nchampion who would help him with his putting, and thus, by bringing his\r\nhandicap down a notch or two, enable him to save something from the\r\nwreck, so to speak. But to link his lot with a girl who read his aunt's\r\nbooks and liked them; a girl who could tolerate the presence of the dog\r\nToto; a girl who clasped her hands in pretty, childish joy when she saw\r\na nasturtium in bloom--it was too much. Nevertheless, he took her hand\r\nand began to speak.\r\n\r\n'Miss Maynard--Rose--'\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes and cast them down. A flush had come into\r\nher cheeks. The dog Toto at her side sat up and begged for cake,\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\n'Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time there was a lonely man who\r\nlived in a cottage all by himself--'\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Was it James Rodman who was talking this bilge?\r\n\r\n'Yes?' whispered the girl.\r\n\r\n'--but one day there came to him out of nowhere a little fairy\r\nprincess. She--'\r\n\r\nHe stopped again, but this time not because of the sheer shame of\r\nlistening to his own voice. What caused him to interrupt his tale was\r\nthe fact that at this moment the tea-table suddenly began to rise\r\nslowly in the air, tilting as it did so a considerable quantity of hot\r\ntea on to the knees of his trousers.\r\n\r\n'Ouch!' cried James, leaping.\r\n\r\nThe table continued to rise, and then fell sideways, revealing the\r\nhomely countenance of William, who, concealed by the cloth, had been\r\ntaking a nap beneath it. He moved slowly forward, his eyes on Toto. For\r\nmany a long day William had been desirous of putting to the test, once\r\nand for all, the problem of whether Toto was edible or not. Sometimes\r\nhe thought yes, at other times no. Now seemed an admirable opportunity\r\nfor a definite decision. He advanced on the object of his experiment,\r\nmaking a low whistling noise through his nostrils, not unlike a boiling\r\nkettle. And Toto, after one long look of incredulous horror, tucked\r\nhis shapely tail between his legs and, turning, raced for safety. He\r\nhad laid a course in a bee-line for the open garden gate, and William,\r\nshaking a dish of marmalade off his head a little petulantly, galloped\r\nponderously after him. Rose Maynard staggered to her feet.\r\n\r\n'Oh, save him!' she cried.\r\n\r\nWithout a word James added himself to the procession. His interest in\r\nToto was but tepid. What he wanted was to get near enough to William to\r\ndiscuss with him that matter of the tea on his trousers. He reached the\r\nroad and found that the order of the runners had not changed. For so\r\nsmall a dog, Toto was moving magnificently. A cloud of dust rose as he\r\nskidded round the corner. William followed. James followed William.\r\n\r\nAnd so they passed Farmer Birkett's barn, Farmer Giles's cow shed,\r\nthe place where Farmer Willetts's pigsty used to be before the big\r\nfire, and the Bunch of Grapes public-house, Jno. Biggs propr., licensed\r\nto sell tobacco, wines, and spirits. And it was as they were turning\r\ndown the lane that leads past Farmer Robinson's chicken run that Toto,\r\nthinking swiftly, bolted abruptly into a small drain pipe.\r\n\r\n'William!' roared James, coming up at a canter. He stopped to pluck a\r\nbranch from the hedge and swooped darkly on.\r\n\r\nWilliam had been crouching before the pipe, making a noise like a\r\nbassoon into its interior; but now he rose and came beamingly to James.\r\nHis eyes were aglow with chumminess and affection; and placing his\r\nforefeet on James's chest, he licked him three times on the face in\r\nrapid succession. And as he did so, something seemed to snap in James.\r\nThe scales seemed to fall from James's eyes. For the first time he saw\r\nWilliam as he really was, the authentic type of dog that saves his\r\nmaster from a frightful peril. A wave of emotion swept over him.\r\n\r\n'William!' he muttered. 'William!'\r\n\r\nWilliam was making an early supper off a half brick he had found in the\r\nroad. James stooped and patted him fondly.\r\n\r\n'William,' he whispered, 'you knew when the time had come to change\r\nthe conversation, didn't you, old boy!' He straightened himself.\r\n'Come, William,' he said. 'Another four miles and we reach Meadowsweet\r\nJunction. Make it snappy and we shall just catch the up express, first\r\nstop London.'\r\n\r\nWilliam looked up into his face and it seemed to James that he gave\r\na brief nod of comprehension and approval. James turned. Through the\r\ntrees to the east he could see the red roof of Honeysuckle Cottage,\r\nlurking like some evil dragon in ambush.\r\n\r\nThen, together, man and dog passed silently into the sunset.\r\n\r\nThat (concluded Mr Mulliner) is the story of my distant cousin James\r\nRodman. As to whether it is true, that, of course, is an open question.\r\nI, personally, am of opinion that it is. There is no doubt that James\r\ndid go to live at Honeysuckle Cottage and, while there, underwent some\r\nexperience which has left an ineradicable mark upon him. His eyes today\r\nhave that unmistakable look which is to be seen only in the eyes of\r\nconfirmed bachelors whose feet have been dragged to the very brink\r\nof the pit and who have gazed at close range into the naked face of\r\nmatrimony.\r\n\r\nAnd, if further proof be needed, there is William. He is now James's\r\ninseparable companion. Would any man be habitually seen in public with\r\na dog like William unless he had some solid cause to be grateful to\r\nhim--unless they were linked together by some deep and imperishable\r\nmemory? I think not. Myself, when I observe William coming along\r\nthe street, I cross the road and look into a shop window till he has\r\npassed. I am not a snob, but I dare not risk my position in Society by\r\nbeing seen talking to that curious compound.\r\n\r\nNor is the precaution an unnecessary one. There is about William a\r\nshameless absence of appreciation of class distinctions which recalls\r\nthe worst excesses of the French Revolution. I have seen him with these\r\neyes chivvy a pomeranian belonging to a Baroness in her own right from\r\nnear the Achilles Statue to within a few yards of the Marble Arch.\r\n\r\nAnd yet James walks daily with him in Piccadilly. It is surely\r\nsignificant."
