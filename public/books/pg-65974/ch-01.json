Lots of people think I'm much too dependent on him. My Aunt\r\nAgatha, in fact, has even gone so far as to call him my keeper. Well,\r\nwhat I say is: Why not? The man's a genius. From the collar upward he\r\nstands alone, I gave up trying to run my own affairs within a week of\r\nhis coming to me. That was about half a dozen years ago, directly after\r\nthe rather rummy business of Florence Craye, my Uncle Willoughby's\r\nbook, and Edwin, the Boy Scout.\r\n\r\nThe thing really began when I got back to Easeby, my uncle's place in\r\nShropshire. I was spending a week or so there, as I generally did in\r\nthe summer; and I had had to break my visit to come back to London\r\nto get a new valet. I had found Meadowes, the fellow I had taken to\r\nEaseby with me, sneaking my silk socks, a thing no bloke of spirit\r\ncould stick at any price. It transpiring, moreover, that he had looted\r\na lot of other things here and there about the place, I was reluctantly\r\ncompelled to hand the misguided blighter the mitten and go to London\r\nto ask the registry office to dig up another specimen for my approval.\r\nThey sent me Jeeves.\r\n\r\nI shall always remember the morning he came. It so happened that the\r\nnight before I had been present at a rather cheery little supper, and\r\nI was feeling pretty rocky. On top of this I was trying to read a book\r\nFlorence Craye had given me. She had been one of the house-party at\r\nEaseby, and two or three days before I left we had got engaged. I was\r\ndue back at the end of the week, and I knew she would expect me to\r\nhave finished the book by then. You see, she was particularly keen on\r\nboosting me up a bit nearer her own plane of intellect. She was a girl\r\nwith a wonderful profile, but steeped to the gills in serious purpose.\r\nI can't give you a better idea of the way things stood than by telling\r\nyou that the book she'd given me to read was called _Types of Ethical\r\nTheory_, and that when I opened it at random I struck a page beginning:\r\n\r\n    The postulate or common understanding involved in speech is\r\n    certainly co-extensive, in the obligation it carries, with the\r\n    social organism of which language is the instrument, and the ends\r\n    of which it is an effort to subserve.\r\n\r\nAll perfectly true, no doubt; but not the sort of thing to spring on a\r\nlad with a morning head.\r\n\r\nI was doing my best to skim through this bright little volume when\r\nthe bell rang. I crawled off the sofa and opened the door. A kind of\r\ndarkish sort of respectful Johnnie stood without.\r\n\r\n'I was sent by the agency, sir,' he said. 'I was given to understand\r\nthat you required a valet.'\r\n\r\nI'd have preferred an undertaker; but I told him to stagger in, and\r\nhe floated noiselessly through the doorway like a healing zephyr.\r\nThat impressed me from the start. Meadowes had had flat feet and used\r\nto clump. This fellow didn't seem to have any feet at all. He just\r\nstreamed in. He had a grave, sympathetic face, as if he, too, knew what\r\nit was to sup with the lads.\r\n\r\n'Excuse me, sir,' he said gently.\r\n\r\nThen he seemed to flicker, and wasn't there any longer. I heard him\r\nmoving about in the kitchen, and presently he came back with a glass on\r\na tray.\r\n\r\n'If you would drink this, sir,' he said, with a kind of bedside manner,\r\nrather like the royal doctor shooting the bracer into the sick prince.\r\n'It is a little preparation of my own invention. It is the Worcester\r\nSauce that gives it its colour. The raw egg makes it nutritious. The\r\nred pepper gives it its bite. Gentlemen have told me they have found it\r\nextremely invigorating after a late evening.'\r\n\r\nI would have clutched at anything that looked like a lifeline that\r\nmorning. I swallowed the stuff. For a moment I felt as if somebody had\r\ntouched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling down my throat\r\nwith a lighted torch, and then everything seemed suddenly to get all\r\nright. The sun shone in through the window; birds twittered in the\r\ntree-tops; and, generally speaking, hope dawned once more.\r\n\r\n'You're engaged!' I said, as soon as I could say anything.\r\n\r\nI perceived clearly that this cove was one of the world's workers, the\r\nsort no home should be without.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir. My name is Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'You can start in at once?'\r\n\r\n'Immediately, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Because I'm due down at Easeby, in Shropshire, the day after tomorrow.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.' He looked past me at the mantelpiece. 'That is an\r\nexcellent likeness of Lady Florence Craye, sir. It is two years since\r\nI saw her ladyship. I was at one time in Lord Worplesdon's employment.\r\nI tendered my resignation because I could not see eye to eye with his\r\nlordship in his desire to dine in dress trousers, a flannel shirt, and\r\na shooting coat.'\r\n\r\nHe couldn't tell me anything I didn't know about the old boy's\r\neccentricity. This Lord Worplesdon was Florence's father. He was the\r\nold buster who, a few years later, came down to breakfast one morning,\r\nlifted the first cover he saw, said 'Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Damn all eggs!'\r\nin an overwrought sort of voice, and instantly legged it for France,\r\nnever to return to the bosom of his family. This, mind you, being a bit\r\nof luck for the bosom of the family, for old Worplesdon had the worst\r\ntemper in the county.\r\n\r\nI had known the family ever since I was a kid, and from boyhood up this\r\nold boy had put the fear of death into me. Time, the great healer,\r\ncould never remove from my memory the occasion when he found me--then\r\na stripling of fifteen--smoking one of his special cigars in the\r\nstables. He got after me with a hunting-crop just at the moment when I\r\nwas beginning to realize that what I wanted most on earth was solitude\r\nand repose, and chased me more than a mile across difficult country.\r\nIf there was a flaw, so to speak, in the pure joy of being engaged\r\nto Florence, it was the fact that she rather took after her father,\r\nand one was never certain when she might erupt. She had a wonderful\r\nprofile, though.\r\n\r\n'Lady Florence and I are engaged, Jeeves,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\nYou know, there was a kind of rummy something about his manner.\r\nPerfectly all right and all that, but not what you'd call chirpy.\r\nIt somehow gave me the impression that he wasn't keen on Florence.\r\nWell, of course, it wasn't my business. I supposed that while he had\r\nbeen valeting old Worplesdon she must have trodden on his toes in\r\nsome way. Florence was a dear girl, and, seen sideways, most awfully\r\ngood-looking; but if she had a fault it was a tendency to be a bit\r\nimperious with the domestic staff.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the proceedings there was another ring at the front\r\ndoor. Jeeves shimmered out and came back with a telegram. I opened it.\r\nIt ran:\r\n\r\n    Return immediately. Extremely urgent. Catch first train. Florence.\r\n\r\n'Rum!' I said.\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, nothing!'\r\n\r\nIt shows how little I knew Jeeves in those days that I didn't go a\r\nbit deeper into the matter with him. Nowadays I would never dream of\r\nreading a rummy communication without asking him what he thought of\r\nit. And this one was devilish odd. What I mean is, Florence knew I was\r\ngoing back to Easeby the day after tomorrow, anyway; so why the hurry\r\ncall? Something must have happened, of course; but I couldn't see what\r\non earth it could be.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'we shall be going down to Easeby this afternoon. Can\r\nyou manage it?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You can get your packing done and all that?'\r\n\r\n'Without any difficulty, sir. Which suit will you wear for the journey?'\r\n\r\n'This one.'\r\n\r\nI had on a rather sprightly young check that morning, to which I was a\r\ngood deal attached; I fancied it, in fact, more than a little. It was\r\nperhaps rather sudden till you got used to it, but, nevertheless, an\r\nextremely sound effort, which many lads at the club and elsewhere had\r\nadmired unrestrainedly.\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nAgain there was that kind of rummy something in his manner. It was\r\nthe way he said it, don't you know. He didn't like the suit. I pulled\r\nmyself together to assert myself. Something seemed to tell me that,\r\nunless I was jolly careful and nipped this lad in the bud, he would\r\nbe starting to boss me. He had the aspect of a distinctly resolute\r\nblighter.\r\n\r\nWell, I wasn't going to have any of that sort of thing, by Jove!\r\nI'd seen so many cases of fellows who had become perfect slaves to\r\ntheir valets. I remember poor old Aubrey Fothergill telling me--with\r\nabsolute tears in his eyes, poor chap!--one night at the club, that\r\nhe had been compelled to give up a favourite pair of brown shoes\r\nsimply because Meekyn, his man, disapproved of them. You have to\r\nkeep these fellows in their place, don't you know. You have to work\r\nthe good old iron-hand-in-the-velvet-glove wheeze. If you give them a\r\nwhat's-its-name, they take a thingummy.\r\n\r\n'Don't you like this suit, Jeeves?' I said coldly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what don't you like about it?'\r\n\r\n'It is a very nice suit, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what's wrong with it? Out with it, dash it!'\r\n\r\n'If I might make the suggestion, sir, a simple brown or blue, with a\r\nhint of some quiet twill--'\r\n\r\n'What absolute rot!'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Perfectly blithering, my dear man!'\r\n\r\n'As you say, sir.'\r\n\r\nI felt as if I had stepped on the place where the last stair ought to\r\nhave been, but wasn't. I felt defiant, if you know what I mean, and\r\nthere didn't seem anything to defy.\r\n\r\n'All right, then,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nAnd then he went away to collect his kit, while I started in again\r\non _Types of Ethical Theory_ and took a stab at a chapter headed\r\n'Idiopsychological Ethics'.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost of the way down in the train that afternoon, I was wondering what\r\ncould be up at the other end. I simply couldn't see what could have\r\nhappened. Easeby wasn't one of those country houses you read about in\r\nthe society novels, where young girls are lured on to play baccarat and\r\nthen skinned to the bone of their jewellery, and so on. The house-party\r\nI had left had consisted entirely of law-abiding birds like myself.\r\n\r\nBesides, my uncle wouldn't have let anything of that kind go on in his\r\nhouse. He was a rather stiff, precise sort of old boy, who liked a\r\nquiet life. He was just finishing a history of the family or something,\r\nwhich he had been working on for the last year, and didn't stir much\r\nfrom the library. He was rather a good instance of what they say about\r\nits being a good scheme for a fellow to sow his wild oats. I'd been\r\ntold that in his youth Uncle Willoughby had been a bit of a rounder.\r\nYou would never have thought it to look at him now.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the house, Oakshott, the butler, told me that Florence\r\nwas in her room, watching her maid pack. Apparently there was a dance\r\non at a house about twenty miles away that night, and she was motoring\r\nover with some of the Easeby lot and would be away some nights.\r\nOakshott said she had told him to tell her the moment I arrived; so I\r\ntrickled into the smoking-room and waited, and presently in she came. A\r\nglance showed me that she was perturbed, and even peeved. Her eyes had\r\na goggly look, and altogether she appeared considerably pipped.\r\n\r\n'Darling!' I said, and attempted the good old embrace; but she\r\nside-stepped like a bantam-weight.\r\n\r\n'Don't!'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?'\r\n\r\n'Everything's the matter! Bertie, you remember asking me, when you\r\nleft, to make myself pleasant to your uncle?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nThe idea being, of course, that as at that time I was more or less\r\ndependent on Uncle Willoughby I couldn't very well marry without his\r\napproval. And though I knew he wouldn't have any objection to Florence,\r\nhaving known her father since they were at Oxford together, I hadn't\r\nwanted to take any chances; so I had told her to make an effort to\r\nfascinate the old boy.\r\n\r\n'You told me it would please him particularly if I asked him to read me\r\nsome of his history of the family.'\r\n\r\n'Wasn't he pleased?'\r\n\r\n'He was delighted. He finished writing the thing yesterday afternoon,\r\nand read me nearly all of it last night. I have never had such a shock\r\nin my life. The book is an outrage. It is impossible. It is horrible!'\r\n\r\n'But, dash it, the family weren't so bad as all that.'\r\n\r\n'It is not a history of the family at all. Your uncle has written his\r\nreminiscences! He calls them \"Recollections of a Long Life\"!'\r\n\r\nI began to understand. As I say, Uncle Willoughby had been somewhat on\r\nthe tabasco side as a young man, and it began to look as if he might\r\nhave turned out something pretty fruity if he had started recollecting\r\nhis long life.\r\n\r\n'If half of what he has written is true,' said Florence, 'your uncle's\r\nyouth must have been perfectly appalling. The moment we began to read\r\nhe plunged straight into a most scandalous story of how he and my\r\nfather were thrown out of a music-hall in 1887!'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'I decline to tell you why.'\r\n\r\nIt must have been something pretty bad. It took a lot to make them\r\nchuck people out of music-halls in 1887.\r\n\r\n'Your uncle specifically states that father had drunk a quart and a\r\nhalf of champagne before beginning the evening,' she went on. 'The\r\nbook is full of stories like that. There is a dreadful one about Lord\r\nEmsworth.'\r\n\r\n'Lord Emsworth? Not the one we know? Not the one at Blandings?'\r\n\r\nA most respectable old Johnnie, don't you know. Doesn't do a thing\r\nnowadays but dig in the garden with a spud.\r\n\r\n'The very same. That is what makes the book so unspeakable. It is full\r\nof stories about people one knows who are the essence of propriety\r\ntoday, but who seem to have behaved, when they were in London in\r\nthe eighties, in a manner that would not have been tolerated in\r\nthe fo'c'sle of a whaler. Your uncle seems to remember everything\r\ndisgraceful that happened to anybody when he was in his early twenties.\r\nThere is a story about Sir Stanley Gervase-Gervase at Rosherville\r\nGardens which is ghastly in its perfection of detail. It seems that\r\nSir Stanley--but I can't tell you!'\r\n\r\n'Have a dash!'\r\n\r\n'No!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, I shouldn't worry. No publisher will print the book if it's\r\nas bad as all that.'\r\n\r\n'On the contrary, your uncle told me that all negotiations are settled\r\nwith Riggs and Ballinger, and he's sending off the manuscript tomorrow\r\nfor immediate publication. They make a special thing of that sort of\r\nbook. They published Lady Carnaby's _Memories of Eighty Interesting\r\nYears_.'\r\n\r\n'I read 'em!'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, when I tell you that Lady Carnaby's Memories are simply\r\nnot to be compared with your uncle's Recollections, you will understand\r\nmy state of mind. And father appears in nearly every story in the book!\r\nI am horrified at the things he did when he was a young man!'\r\n\r\n'What's to be done?'\r\n\r\n'The manuscript must be intercepted before it reaches Riggs and\r\nBallinger, and destroyed!'\r\n\r\nI sat up.\r\n\r\nThis sounded rather sporting.\r\n\r\n'How are you going to do it?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n'How can I do it? Didn't I tell you the parcel goes off tomorrow? I\r\nam going to the Murgatroyds' dance tonight and shall not be back till\r\nMonday. You must do it. That is why I telegraphed to you.'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\nShe gave me a look.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to say you refuse to help me, Bertie?'\r\n\r\n'No; but--I say!'\r\n\r\n'It's quite simple.'\r\n\r\n'But even if I--What I mean is--Of course, anything I can do--but--if\r\nyou know what I mean--'\r\n\r\n'You say you want to marry me, Bertie?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, of course; but still--'\r\n\r\nFor a moment she looked exactly like her old father.\r\n\r\n'I will never marry you if those Recollections are published.'\r\n\r\n'But, Florence, old thing!'\r\n\r\n'I mean it. You may look on it as a test, Bertie. If you have the\r\nresource and courage to carry this thing through, I will take it as\r\nevidence that you are not the vapid and shiftless person most people\r\nthink you. If you fail, I shall know that your Aunt Agatha was right\r\nwhen she called you a spineless invertebrate and advised me strongly\r\nnot to marry you. It will be perfectly simple for you to intercept the\r\nmanuscript, Bertie. It only requires a little resolution.'\r\n\r\n'But suppose Uncle Willoughby catches me at it? He'd cut me off with a\r\nbob.'\r\n\r\n'If you care more for your uncle's money than for me--'\r\n\r\n'No, no! Rather not!'\r\n\r\n'Very well, then. The parcel containing the manuscript will, of course,\r\nbe placed on the hall table tomorrow for Oakshott to take to the\r\nvillage with the letters. All you have to do is to take it away and\r\ndestroy it. Then your uncle will think it has been lost in the post.'\r\n\r\nIt sounded thin to me.\r\n\r\n'Hasn't he got a copy of it?'\r\n\r\n'No; it has not been typed. He is sending the manuscript just as he\r\nwrote it.'\r\n\r\n'But he could write it over again.'\r\n\r\n'As if he would have the energy!'\r\n\r\n'But--'\r\n\r\n'If you are going to do nothing but make absurd objections, Bertie--'\r\n\r\n'I was only pointing things out.'\r\n\r\n'Well, don't! Once and for all, will you do me this quite simple act of\r\nkindness?'\r\n\r\nThe way she put it gave me an idea.\r\n\r\n'Why not get Edwin to do it? Keep it in the family, kind of, don't you\r\nknow. Besides, it would be a boon to the kid.'\r\n\r\nA jolly bright idea it seemed to me. Edwin was her young brother, who\r\nwas spending his holidays at Easeby. He was a ferret-faced kid, whom I\r\nhad disliked since birth. As a matter of fact, talking of Recollections\r\nand Memories, it was young blighted Edwin who, nine years before, had\r\nled his father to where I was smoking his cigar and caused all the\r\nunpleasantness. He was fourteen now and had just joined the Boy Scouts.\r\nHe was one of those thorough kids, and took his responsibilities pretty\r\nseriously. He was always in a sort of fever because he was dropping\r\nbehind schedule with his daily acts of kindness. However hard he tried,\r\nhe'd fall behind; and then you would find him prowling about the house,\r\nsetting such a clip to try and catch up with himself that Easeby was\r\nrapidly becoming a perfect hell for man and beast.\r\n\r\nThe idea didn't seem to strike Florence.\r\n\r\n'I shall do nothing of the kind, Bertie. I wonder you can't appreciate\r\nthe compliment I am paying you--trusting you like this.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I see that all right, but what I mean is, Edwin would do it so\r\nmuch better than I would. These Boy Scouts are up to all sorts of\r\ndodges. They spoor, don't you know, and take cover and creep about, and\r\nwhat-not.'\r\n\r\n'Bertie, will you or will you not do this perfectly trivial thing for\r\nme? If not, say so now, and let us end this farce of pretending that\r\nyou care a snap of the fingers for me.'\r\n\r\n'Dear old soul, I love you devotedly!'\r\n\r\n'Then will you or will you not--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' I said. 'All right! All right! All right!'\r\n\r\nAnd then I tottered forth to think it over. I met Jeeves in the passage\r\njust outside.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon, sir. I was endeavouring to find you.'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?'\r\n\r\n'I felt that I should tell you, sir, that somebody has been putting\r\nblack polish on our brown walking shoes.'\r\n\r\n'What! Who? Why?'\r\n\r\n'I could not say, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Can anything be done with them?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Damn!'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI've often wondered since then how these murderer fellows manage to\r\nkeep in shape while they're contemplating their next effort. I had a\r\nmuch simpler sort of job on hand, and the thought of it rattled me to\r\nsuch an extent in the night watches that I was a perfect wreck next\r\nday. Dark circles under the eyes--I give you my word! I had to call on\r\nJeeves to rally round with one of those life-savers of his.\r\n\r\nFrom breakfast on I felt like a bag-snatcher at a railway station. I\r\nhad to hang about waiting for the parcel to be put on the hall table,\r\nand it wasn't put. Uncle Willoughby was a fixture in the library,\r\nadding the finishing touches to the great work, I supposed, and the\r\nmore I thought the thing over the less I liked it. The chances against\r\nmy pulling it off seemed about three to two, and the thought of what\r\nwould happen if I didn't gave me cold shivers down the spine. Uncle\r\nWilloughby was a pretty mild sort of old boy, as a rule, but I've known\r\nhim to cut up rough, and, by Jove, he was scheduled to extend himself\r\nif he caught me trying to get away with his life work.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't till nearly four that he toddled out of the library with the\r\nparcel under his arm, put it on the table, and toddled off again.\r\nI was hiding a bit to the south-east at the moment, behind a suit\r\nof armour. I bounded out and legged it for the table. Then I ripped\r\nupstairs to hide the swag. I charged in like a mustang and nearly\r\nstubbed my toe on young blighted Edwin, the Boy Scout. He was standing\r\nat the chest of drawers, confound him, messing about with my ties.\r\n\r\n'Hallo!' he said.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing here?'\r\n\r\n'I'm tidying your room. It's my last Saturday's act of kindness.'\r\n\r\n'Last Saturday's.'\r\n\r\n'I'm five days behind. I was six till last night, but I polished your\r\nshoes.'\r\n\r\n'Was it you--'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Did you see them? I just happened to think of it. I was in here,\r\nlooking round. Mr Berkeley had this room while you were away. He left\r\nthis morning. I thought perhaps he might have left something in it that\r\nI could have sent on. I've often done acts of kindness that way.'\r\n\r\n'You must be a comfort to one and all!'\r\n\r\nIt became more and more apparent to me that this infernal kid must\r\nsomehow be turned out eftsoons or right speedily. I had hidden the\r\nparcel behind my back, and I didn't think he had seen it; but I wanted\r\nto get at that chest of drawers quick, before anyone else came along.\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't bother about tidying the room,' I said.\r\n\r\n'I like tidying it. It's not a bit of trouble--really.'\r\n\r\n'But it's quite tidy now.'\r\n\r\n'Not so tidy as I shall make it.'\r\n\r\nThis was getting perfectly rotten. I didn't want to murder the kid, and\r\nyet there didn't seem any other way of shifting him. I pressed down the\r\nmental accelerator. The old lemon throbbed fiercely. I got an idea.\r\n\r\n'There's something much kinder than that which you could do,' I said.\r\n'You see that box of cigars? Take it down to the smoking-room and snip\r\noff the ends for me. That would save me no end of trouble. Stagger\r\nalong, laddie.'\r\n\r\nHe seemed a bit doubtful; but he staggered. I shoved the parcel into\r\na drawer, locked it, trousered the key, and felt better. I might be a\r\nchump, but, dash it, I could out-general a mere kid with a face like a\r\nferret. I went downstairs again. Just as I was passing the smoking-room\r\ndoor out curveted Edwin. It seemed to me that if he wanted to do a real\r\nact of kindness he would commit suicide.\r\n\r\n'I'm snipping them,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Snip on! Snip on!'\r\n\r\n'Do you like them snipped much, or only a bit?'\r\n\r\n'Medium.'\r\n\r\n'All right. I'll be getting on, then.'\r\n\r\n'I should.'\r\n\r\nAnd we parted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFellows who know all about that sort of thing--detectives, and so\r\non--will tell you that the most difficult thing in the world is to get\r\nrid of the body. I remember, as a kid, having to learn by heart a poem\r\nabout a bird by the name of Eugene Aram, who had the deuce of a job in\r\nthis respect. All I can recall of the actual poetry is the bit that\r\ngoes:\r\n\r\n    Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum-tumty-tum,\r\n    I slew him, tum-tum tum!\r\n\r\nBut I recollect that the poor blighter spent much of his valuable time\r\ndumping the corpse into ponds and burying it, and what-not, only to\r\nhave it pop out at him again. It was about an hour after I had shoved\r\nthe parcel into the drawer when I realized that I had let myself in for\r\njust the same sort of thing.\r\n\r\nFlorence had talked in an airy sort of way about destroying the\r\nmanuscript; but when one came down to it, how the deuce can a chap\r\ndestroy a great chunky mass of paper in somebody else's house in the\r\nmiddle of summer? I couldn't ask to have a fire in my bedroom, with the\r\nthermometer in the eighties. And if I didn't burn the thing, how else\r\ncould I get rid of it? Fellows on the battlefield eat dispatches to\r\nkeep them from falling into the hands of the enemy, but it would have\r\ntaken me a year to eat Uncle Willoughby's Recollections.\r\n\r\nI'm bound to say the problem absolutely baffled me. The only thing\r\nseemed to be to leave the parcel in the drawer and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether you have ever experienced it, but it's a dashed\r\nunpleasant thing having a crime on one's conscience. Towards the end\r\nof the day the mere sight of the drawer began to depress me. I found\r\nmyself getting all on edge; and once when Uncle Willoughby trickled\r\nsilently into the smoking-room when I was alone there and spoke to me\r\nbefore I knew he was there, I broke the record for the sitting high\r\njump.\r\n\r\nI was wondering all the time when Uncle Willoughby would sit up and\r\ntake notice. I didn't think he would have time to suspect that anything\r\nhad gone wrong till Saturday morning, when he would be expecting,\r\nof course, to get the acknowledgement of the manuscript from the\r\npublishers. But early on Friday evening he came out of the library as\r\nI was passing and asked me to step in. He was looking considerably\r\nrattled.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he said--he always spoke in a precise sort of pompous kind\r\nof way--'an exceedingly disturbing thing has happened. As you know, I\r\ndispatched the manuscript of my book to Messrs Riggs and Ballinger, the\r\npublishers, yesterday afternoon. It should have reached them by the\r\nfirst post this morning. Why I should have been uneasy I cannot say,\r\nbut my mind was not altogether at rest respecting the safety of the\r\nparcel. I therefore telephoned to Messrs Riggs and Ballinger a few\r\nmoments back to make inquiries. To my consternation they informed me\r\nthat they were not yet in receipt of my manuscript.'\r\n\r\n'Very rum!'\r\n\r\n'I recollect distinctly placing it myself on the hall table in good\r\ntime to be taken to the village. But here is a sinister thing. I have\r\nspoken to Oakshott, who took the rest of the letters to the post\r\noffice, and he cannot recall seeing it there. He is, indeed, unswerving\r\nin his assertions that when he went to the hall to collect the letters\r\nthere was no parcel among them.'\r\n\r\n'Sounds funny!'\r\n\r\n'Bertie, shall I tell you what I suspect?'\r\n\r\n'What's that?'\r\n\r\n'The suspicion will no doubt sound to you incredible, but it alone\r\nseems to fit the facts as we know them. I incline to the belief that\r\nthe parcel has been stolen.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say! Surely not!'\r\n\r\n'Wait! Hear me out. Though I have said nothing to you before, or to\r\nanyone else, concerning the matter, the fact remains that during the\r\npast few weeks a number of objects--some valuable, others not--have\r\ndisappeared in this house. The conclusion to which one is irresistibly\r\nimpelled is that we have a kleptomaniac in our midst. It is a\r\npeculiarity of kleptomania, as you are no doubt aware, that the subject\r\nis unable to differentiate between the intrinsic values of objects. He\r\nwill purloin an old coat as readily as a diamond ring, or a tobacco\r\npipe costing but a few shillings with the same eagerness as a purse of\r\ngold. The fact that this manuscript of mine could be of no possible\r\nvalue to any outside person convinces me that--'\r\n\r\n'But, uncle, one moment; I know all about those things that were\r\nstolen. It was Meadowes, my man, who pinched them. I caught him\r\nsnaffling my silk socks. Right in the act, by Jove!'\r\n\r\nHe was tremendously impressed.\r\n\r\n'You amaze me, Bertie! Send for the man at once and question him.'\r\n\r\n'But he isn't here. You see, directly I found that he was a\r\nsock-sneaker I gave him the boot. That's why I went to London--to get a\r\nnew man.'\r\n\r\n'Then, if the man Meadowes is no longer in the house it could not be he\r\nwho purloined my manuscript. The whole thing is inexplicable.'\r\n\r\nAfter which we brooded for a bit. Uncle Willoughby pottered about the\r\nroom, registering baffledness, while I sat sucking at a cigarette,\r\nfeeling rather like a chappie I'd once read about in a book, who\r\nmurdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table, and\r\nthen had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there all\r\nthe time. My guilty secret oppressed me to such an extent that after\r\na while I couldn't stick it any longer. I lit another cigarette and\r\nstarted for a stroll in the grounds, by way of cooling off.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those still evenings you get in the summer, when you can\r\nhear a snail clear its throat a mile away. The sun was sinking over\r\nthe hills and the gnats were fooling about all over the place, and\r\neverything smelled rather topping--what with the falling dew and so\r\non--and I was just beginning to feel a little soothed by the peace of\r\nit all when suddenly I heard my name spoken.\r\n\r\n'It's about Bertie.'\r\n\r\nIt was the loathsome voice of young blighted Edwin! For a moment I\r\ncouldn't locate it. Then I realized that it came from the library. My\r\nstroll had taken me within a few yards of the open window.\r\n\r\nI had often wondered how those Johnnies in books did it--I mean the\r\nfellows with whom it was the work of a moment to do about a dozen\r\nthings that ought to have taken them about ten minutes. But, as a\r\nmatter of fact, it was the work of a moment with me to chuck away my\r\ncigarette, swear a bit, leap about ten yards, dive into a bush that\r\nstood near the library window, and stand there with my ears flapping. I\r\nwas as certain as I've ever been of anything that all sorts of rotten\r\nthings were in the offing.\r\n\r\n'About Bertie?' I heard Uncle Willoughby say.\r\n\r\n'About Bertie and your parcel. I heard you talking to him just now. I\r\nbelieve he's got it.'\r\n\r\nWhen I tell you that just as I heard these frightful words a fairly\r\nsubstantial beetle of sorts dropped from the bush down the back of my\r\nneck, and I couldn't even stir to squash the same, you will understand\r\nthat I felt pretty rotten. Everything seemed against me.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean, boy? I was discussing the disappearance of my\r\nmanuscript with Bertie only a moment back, and he professed himself as\r\nperplexed by the mystery as myself.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I was in his room yesterday afternoon, doing him an act of\r\nkindness, and he came in with a parcel. I could see it, though he\r\ntried to keep it behind his back. And then he asked me to go to the\r\nsmoking-room and snip some cigars for him; and about two minutes\r\nafterwards he came down--and he wasn't carrying anything. So it must be\r\nin his room.'\r\n\r\nI understand they deliberately teach these dashed Boy Scouts to\r\ncultivate their powers of observation and deduction and what-not.\r\nDevilish thoughtless and inconsiderate of them, I call it. Look at the\r\ntrouble it causes.\r\n\r\n'It sounds incredible,' said Uncle Willoughby, thereby bucking me up a\r\ntrifle.\r\n\r\n'Shall I go and look in his room?' asked young blighted Edwin. 'I'm\r\nsure the parcel's there.'\r\n\r\n'But what could be his motive for perpetrating this extraordinary\r\ntheft?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps he's a--what you said just now.'\r\n\r\n'A kleptomaniac? Impossible!'\r\n\r\n'It might have been Bertie who took all those things from the very\r\nstart,' suggested the little brute hopefully. 'He may be like Raffles.'\r\n\r\n'Raffles?'\r\n\r\n'He's a chap in a book who went about pinching things.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot believe that Bertie would--ah--go about pinching things.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm sure he's got the parcel. I'll tell you what you might do.\r\nYou might say that Mr Berkeley wired that he had left something here.\r\nHe had Bertie's room, you know. You might say you wanted to look for\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'That would be possible. I--'\r\n\r\nI didn't wait to hear any more. Things were getting too hot. I sneaked\r\nsoftly out of my bush and raced for the front door. I sprinted up to\r\nmy room and made for the drawer where I had put the parcel. And then\r\nI found I hadn't the key. It wasn't for the deuce of a time that I\r\nrecollected I had shifted it to my evening trousers the night before\r\nand must have forgotten to take it out again.\r\n\r\nWhere the dickens were my evening things? I had looked all over the\r\nplace before I remembered that Jeeves must have taken them away to\r\nbrush. To leap at the bell and ring it was, with me, the work of a\r\nmoment. I had just rung it when there was a footstep outside, and in\r\ncame Uncle Willoughby.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Bertie,' he said, without a blush, 'I have--ah--received a\r\ntelegram from Berkeley, who occupied this room in your absence, asking\r\nme to forward him his--er--his cigarette-case, which, it would appear,\r\nhe inadvertently omitted to take with him when he left the house. I\r\ncannot find it downstairs; and it has, therefore, occurred to me that\r\nhe may have left it in this room. I will--er--just take a look round.'\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most disgusting spectacles I've ever seen--this\r\nwhite-haired old man, who should have been thinking of the hereafter,\r\nstanding there lying like an actor.\r\n\r\n'I haven't seen it anywhere,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Nevertheless, I will search. I must--ah--spare no effort.'\r\n\r\n'I should have seen it if it had been here--what?'\r\n\r\n'It may have escaped your notice. It is--er--possibly in one of the\r\ndrawers.'\r\n\r\nHe began to nose about. He pulled out drawer after drawer, pottering\r\nround like an old bloodhound, and babbling from time to time about\r\nBerkeley and his cigarette-case in a way that struck me as perfectly\r\nghastly. I just stood there, losing weight every moment.\r\n\r\nThen he came to the drawer where the parcel was.\r\n\r\n'This appears to be locked,' he said, rattling the handle.\r\n\r\n'Yes; I shouldn't bother about that one. It--it's--er--locked, and all\r\nthat sort of thing.'\r\n\r\n'You have not the key?'\r\n\r\nA soft, respectful voice spoke behind me.\r\n\r\n'I fancy, sir, that this must be the key you require. It was in the\r\npocket of your evening trousers.'\r\n\r\nIt was Jeeves. He had shimmered in, carrying my evening things, and was\r\nstanding there holding out the key. I could have massacred the man.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said my uncle.\r\n\r\n'Not at all, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe next moment Uncle Willoughby had opened the drawer. I shut my eyes.\r\n\r\n'No,' said Uncle Willoughby, 'there is nothing here. The drawer\r\nis empty. Thank you, Bertie. I hope I have not disturbed you. I\r\nfancy--er--Berkeley must have taken his case with him after all.'\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone I shut the door carefully. Then I turned to Jeeves.\r\nThe man was putting my evening things out on a chair.\r\n\r\n'Er--Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, nothing.'\r\n\r\nIt was deuced difficult to know how to begin.\r\n\r\n'Er--Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Did you--Was there--Have you by chance--'\r\n\r\n'I removed the parcel this morning, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Oh--ah--why?'\r\n\r\n'I considered it more prudent, sir.'\r\n\r\nI mused for a while.\r\n\r\n'Of course, I suppose all this seems tolerably rummy to you, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all, sir. I chanced to overhear you and Lady Florence speaking\r\nof the matter the other evening, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Did you, by Jove?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well--er--Jeeves, I think that, on the whole, if you were to--as it\r\nwere--freeze on to that parcel until we get back to London--'\r\n\r\n'Exactly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And then we might--er--so to speak--chuck it away somewhere--what?'\r\n\r\n'Precisely, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I'll leave it in your hands.'\r\n\r\n'Entirely, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You know, Jeeves, you're by way of being rather a topper.'\r\n\r\n'I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir.'\r\n\r\n'One in a million, by Jove!'\r\n\r\n'It is very kind of you to say so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's about all, then, I think.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlorence came back on Monday. I didn't see her till we were all having\r\ntea in the hall. It wasn't till the crowd had cleared away a bit that\r\nwe got a chance of having a word together.\r\n\r\n'Well, Bertie?' she said.\r\n\r\n'It's all right.'\r\n\r\n'You have destroyed the manuscript?'\r\n\r\n'Not exactly; but--'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I mean I haven't absolutely--'\r\n\r\n'Bertie, your manner is furtive!'\r\n\r\n'It's all right. It's this way--'\r\n\r\nAnd I was just going to explain how things stood when out of the\r\nlibrary came leaping Uncle Willoughby, looking as braced as a\r\ntwo-year-old. The old boy was a changed man.\r\n\r\n'A most remarkable thing, Bertie! I have just been speaking with Mr\r\nRiggs on the telephone, and he tells me he received my manuscript by\r\nthe first post this morning. I cannot imagine what can have caused the\r\ndelay. Our postal facilities are extremely inadequate in the rural\r\ndistricts. I shall write to headquarters about it. It is insufferable\r\nif valuable parcels are to be delayed in this fashion.'\r\n\r\nI happened to be looking at Florence's profile at the moment, and\r\nat this juncture she swung round and gave me a look that went right\r\nthrough me like a knife. Uncle Willoughby meandered back to the\r\nlibrary, and there was a silence that you could have dug bits out of\r\nwith a spoon.\r\n\r\n'I can't understand it,' I said at last. 'I can't understand it, by\r\nJove!'\r\n\r\n'I can. I can understand it perfectly, Bertie. Your heart failed you.\r\nRather than risk offending your uncle you--'\r\n\r\n'No, no! Absolutely!'\r\n\r\n'You preferred to lose me rather than risk losing the money. Perhaps\r\nyou did not think I meant what I said. I meant every word. Our\r\nengagement is ended.'\r\n\r\n'But--I say!'\r\n\r\n'Not another word!'\r\n\r\n'But, Florence, old thing!'\r\n\r\n'I do not wish to hear any more. I see now that your Aunt Agatha was\r\nperfectly right. I consider that I have had a very lucky escape. There\r\nwas a time when I thought that, with patience, you might be moulded\r\ninto something worth while. I see now that you are impossible!'\r\n\r\nAnd she popped off, leaving me to pick up the pieces. When I had\r\ncollected the debris to some extent I went to my room and rang for\r\nJeeves. He came in looking as if nothing had happened or was ever going\r\nto happen. He was the calmest thing in captivity.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves!' I yelled. 'Jeeves, that parcel has arrived in London!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Did you send it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. I acted for the best, sir. I think that both you and Lady\r\nFlorence overestimated the danger of people being offended at being\r\nmentioned in Sir Willoughby's Recollections. It has been my experience,\r\nsir, that the normal person enjoys seeing his or her name in print,\r\nirrespective of what is said about them. I have an aunt, sir, who a\r\nfew years ago was a martyr to swollen limbs. She tried Walkinshaw's\r\nSupreme Ointment and obtained considerable relief--so much so that\r\nshe sent them an unsolicited testimonial. Her pride at seeing her\r\nphotograph in the daily papers in connexion with descriptions of her\r\nlower limbs before taking, which were nothing less than revolting, was\r\nso intense that it led me to believe that publicity, of whatever sort,\r\nis what nearly everybody desires. Moreover, if you have ever studied\r\npsychology, sir, you will know that respectable old gentlemen are by no\r\nmeans averse to having it advertised that they were extremely wild in\r\ntheir youth. I have an uncle--'\r\n\r\nI cursed his aunts and his uncles and him and all the rest of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n'Do you know that Lady Florence has broken off her engagement with me?'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\nNot a bit of sympathy! I might have been telling him it was a fine day.\r\n\r\n'You're sacked!'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nHe coughed gently.\r\n\r\n'As I am no longer in your employment, sir, I can speak freely without\r\nappearing to take a liberty. In my opinion you and Lady Florence were\r\nquite unsuitably matched. Her ladyship is of a highly determined\r\nand arbitrary temperament, quite opposed to your own. I was in Lord\r\nWorplesdon's service for nearly a year, during which time I had\r\nample opportunities of studying her ladyship. The opinion of the\r\nservants' hall was far from favourable to her. Her ladyship's temper\r\ncaused a good deal of adverse comment among us. It was at times quite\r\nimpossible. You would not have been happy, sir!'\r\n\r\n'Get out!'\r\n\r\n'I think you would also have found her educational methods a little\r\ntrying, sir. I have glanced at the book her ladyship gave you--it has\r\nbeen lying on your table since our arrival--and it is, in my opinion,\r\nquite unsuitable. You would not have enjoyed it. And I have it from her\r\nladyship's own maid, who happened to overhear a conversation between\r\nher ladyship and one of the gentlemen staying here--Mr Maxwell, who is\r\nemployed in an editorial capacity by one of the reviews--that it was\r\nher intention to start you almost immediately upon Nietzsche. You would\r\nnot enjoy Nietzsche, sir. He is fundamentally unsound.'\r\n\r\n'Get out!'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt's rummy how sleeping on a thing often makes you feel quite different\r\nabout it. It's happened to me over and over again. Somehow or other,\r\nwhen I woke next morning the old heart didn't feel half so broken as\r\nit had done. It was a perfectly topping day, and there was something\r\nabout the way the sun came in at the window and the row the birds were\r\nkicking up in the ivy that made me half wonder whether Jeeves wasn't\r\nright. After all, though she had a wonderful profile, was it such a\r\ncatch being engaged to Florence Craye as the casual observer might\r\nimagine? Wasn't there something in what Jeeves had said about her\r\ncharacter? I began to realize that my ideal wife was something quite\r\ndifferent, something a lot more clinging and drooping and prattling,\r\nand what-not.\r\n\r\nI had got as far as this in thinking the thing out when that _Types of\r\nEthical Theory_ caught my eye. I opened it, and I give you my honest\r\nword this was what hit me:\r\n\r\n    Of the two antithetic terms in the Greek philosophy one only was\r\n    real and self-subsisting; and that one was Ideal Thought as opposed\r\n    to that which it has to penetrate and mould. The other,\r\n    corresponding to our Nature, was in itself phenomenal, unreal,\r\n    without any permanent footing, having no predicates that held true\r\n    for two moments together; in short, redeemed from negation only by\r\n    including indwelling realities appearing through.\r\n\r\nWell--I mean to say--what? And Nietzsche, from all accounts, a lot\r\nworse than that!\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, when he came in with my morning tea, 'I've been\r\nthinking it over. You're engaged again.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\nI sucked down a cheerful mouthful. A great respect for this bloke's\r\njudgement began to soak through me.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Jeeves,' I said; 'about that check suit.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Is it really a frost?'\r\n\r\n'A trifle too bizarre, sir, in my opinion.'\r\n\r\n'But lots of fellows have asked me who my tailor is.'\r\n\r\n'Doubtless in order to avoid him, sir.'\r\n\r\n'He's supposed to be one of the best men in London.'\r\n\r\n'I am saying nothing against his moral character, sir.'\r\n\r\nI hesitated a bit. I had a feeling that I was passing into this\r\nchappie's clutches, and that if I gave in now I should become just like\r\npoor old Aubrey Fothergill, unable to call my soul my own. On the other\r\nhand, this was obviously a cove of rare intelligence, and it would be a\r\ncomfort in a lot of ways to have him doing the thinking for me. I made\r\nup my mind.\r\n\r\n'All right, Jeeves,' I said. 'You know! Give the bally thing away to\r\nsomebody!'\r\n\r\nHe looked down at me like a father gazing tenderly at the wayward child.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir. I gave it to the under-gardener last night. A little\r\nmore tea, sir?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    2--The Artistic Career of Corky\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will notice, as you flit through these reminiscences of mine, that\r\nfrom time to time the scene of action is laid in and around the city of\r\nNew York; and it is just possible that this may occasion the puzzled\r\nlook and the start of surprise. 'What,' it is possible that you may ask\r\nyourselves, 'is Bertram doing so far from his beloved native land?'\r\n\r\nWell, it's a fairly longish story; but, reefing it down a bit and\r\nturning it for the nonce into a two-reeler, what happened was that my\r\nAunt Agatha on one occasion sent me over to America to try to stop\r\nyoung Gussie, my cousin, marrying a girl on the vaudeville stage, and\r\nI got the whole thing so mixed up that I decided it would be a sound\r\nscheme to stop on in New York for a bit instead of going back and\r\nhaving long, cosy chats with her about the affair.\r\n\r\nSo I sent Jeeves out to find a decent flat, and settled down for a\r\nspell of exile.\r\n\r\nI'm bound to say New York's a most sprightly place to be exiled in.\r\nEverybody was awfully good to me, and there seemed to be plenty of\r\nthings going on so, take it for all in all, I didn't undergo any\r\nfrightful hardships. Blokes introduced me to other blokes, and so on\r\nand so forth, and it wasn't long before I knew squads of the right\r\nsort, some who rolled in the stuff in houses up by the Park, and\r\nothers who lived with the gas turned down mostly around Washington\r\nSquare--artists and writers and so forth. Brainy coves.\r\n\r\nCorky, the bird I am about to treat of, was one of the artists.\r\nA portrait-painter, he called himself, but as a matter of fact\r\nhis score up to date had been nil. You see, the catch about\r\nportrait-painting--I've looked into the thing a bit--is that you\r\ncan't start painting portraits till people come along and ask you to,\r\nand they won't come and ask you to until you've painted a lot first.\r\nThis makes it kind of difficult, not to say tough, for the ambitious\r\nyoungster.\r\n\r\nCorky managed to get along by drawing an occasional picture for the\r\ncomic papers--he had rather a gift for funny stuff when he got a good\r\nidea--and doing bedsteads and chairs and things for the advertisements.\r\nHis principal source of income, however, was derived from biting\r\nthe ear of a rich uncle--one Alexander Worple, who was in the jute\r\nbusiness. I'm a bit foggy as to what jute is, but it's apparently\r\nsomething the populace is pretty keen on, for Mr Worple had made quite\r\nan indecently large stack out of it.\r\n\r\nNow, a great many fellows think that having a rich uncle is a pretty\r\nsoft snap; but, according to Corky, such is not the case. Corky's uncle\r\nwas a robust sort of cove, who looked like living for ever. He was\r\nfifty-one, and it seemed as if he might go to par. It was not this,\r\nhowever, that distressed poor Corky, for he was not bigoted and had no\r\nobjection to the man going on living. What Corky kicked at was the way\r\nthe above Worple used to harry him.\r\n\r\nCorky's uncle, you see, didn't want him to be an artist. He didn't\r\nthink he had any talent in that direction. He was always urging him\r\nto chuck Art and go into the jute business and start at the bottom\r\nand work his way up. And what Corky said was that, while he didn't\r\nknow what they did at the bottom of a jute business, instinct told him\r\nthat it was something too beastly for words. Corky, moreover, believed\r\nin his future as an artist. Some day, he said, he was going to make\r\na hit. Meanwhile, by using the utmost tact and persuasiveness, he\r\nwas inducing his uncle to cough up very grudgingly a small quarterly\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn't have got this if his uncle hadn't had a hobby. Mr Worple\r\nwas peculiar in this respect. As a rule, from what I've observed, the\r\nAmerican captain of industry doesn't do anything out of business hours.\r\nWhen he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night,\r\nhe just relapses into a state of coma from which he emerges only to\r\nstart being a captain of industry again. But Mr Worple in his spare\r\ntime was what is known as an ornithologist. He had written a book\r\ncalled _American Birds_, and was writing another, to be called _More\r\nAmerican Birds_. When he had finished that, the presumption was that\r\nhe would begin a third, and keep on till the supply of American birds\r\ngave out. Corky used to go to him about once every three months and let\r\nhim talk about American birds. Apparently you could do what you liked\r\nwith old Worple if you gave him his head first on his pet subject, so\r\nthese little chats used to make Corky's allowance all right for the\r\ntime being. But it was pretty rotten for the poor chap. There was the\r\nfrightful suspense, you see, and, apart from that, birds, except when\r\nbroiled and in the society of a cold bottle, bored him stiff.\r\n\r\nTo complete the character-study of Mr Worple, he was a man of extremely\r\nuncertain temper, and his general tendency was to think that Corky was\r\na poor chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own\r\naccount was just another proof of his innate idiocy. I should imagine\r\nJeeves feels very much the same about me.\r\n\r\nSo when Corky trickled into my apartment one afternoon, shooing a girl\r\nin front of him, and said, 'Bertie, I want you to meet my fiancée, Miss\r\nSinger,' the aspect of the matter which hit me first was precisely the\r\none which he had come to consult me about. The very first words I\r\nspoke were, 'Corky, how about your uncle?'\r\n\r\nThe poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs. He was looking\r\nanxious and worried, like a man who has done the murder all right but\r\ncan't think what the deuce to do with the body.\r\n\r\n'We're so scared, Mr Wooster,' said the girl. 'We were hoping that you\r\nmight suggest a way of breaking it to him.'\r\n\r\nMuriel Singer was one of those very quiet, appealing girls who have a\r\nway of looking at you with their big eyes as if they thought you were\r\nthe greatest thing on earth and wondered that you hadn't got on to it\r\nyet yourself. She sat there in a sort of shrinking way, looking at me\r\nas if she were saying to herself, 'Oh, I do hope this great strong\r\nman isn't going to hurt me.' She gave a fellow a protective kind of\r\nfeeling, made him want to stroke her hand and say, 'There, there,\r\nlittle one!' or words to that effect. She made me feel that there\r\nwas nothing I wouldn't do for her. She was rather like one of those\r\ninnocent-tasting American drinks which creep imperceptibly into your\r\nsystem so that, before you know what you're doing, you're starting out\r\nto reform the world by force if necessary and pausing on your way to\r\ntell the large man in the corner that, if he looks at you like that,\r\nyou will knock his head off. What I mean is, she made me feel alert and\r\ndashing, like a knight-errant or something of that kind. I felt that I\r\nwas with her in this thing to the limit.\r\n\r\n'I don't see why your uncle shouldn't be most awfully bucked,' I said\r\nto Corky. 'He will think Miss Singer the ideal wife for you.'\r\n\r\nCorky declined to cheer up.\r\n\r\n'You don't know him. Even if he did like Muriel, he wouldn't admit\r\nit. That's the sort of pig-headed ass he is. It would be a matter of\r\nprinciple with him to kick. All he would consider would be that I had\r\ngone and taken an important step without asking his advice, and he\r\nwould raise Cain automatically. He's always done it.'\r\n\r\nI strained the old bean to meet this emergency.\r\n\r\n'You want to work it so that he makes Miss Singer's acquaintance\r\nwithout knowing that you know her. Then you come along--'\r\n\r\n'But how can I work it that way?'\r\n\r\nI saw his point. That was the catch.\r\n\r\n'There's only one thing to do,' I said.\r\n\r\n'What's that?'\r\n\r\n'Leave it to Jeeves.'\r\n\r\nAnd I rang the bell.\r\n\r\n'Sir?' said Jeeves, kind of manifesting himself. One of the rummy\r\nthings about Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you very\r\nseldom see him come into a room. He's like one of those weird birds in\r\nIndia who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a\r\nsort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they\r\nwant them. I've got a cousin who's what they call a Theosophist, and\r\nhe says he's often nearly worked the thing himself, but couldn't quite\r\nbring it off, probably owing to having fed in his boyhood on the flesh\r\nof animals slain in anger and pie.\r\n\r\nThe moment I saw the man standing there, registering respectful\r\nattention, a weight seemed to roll off my mind. I felt like a lost\r\nchild who spots his father in the offing.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'we want your advice.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nI boiled down Corky's painful case into a few well-chosen words.\r\n\r\n'So you see what it amounts to, Jeeves. We want you to suggest some way\r\nby which Mr Worple can make Miss Singer's acquaintance without getting\r\non to the fact that Mr Corcoran already knows her. Understand?'\r\n\r\n'Perfectly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, try to think of something.'\r\n\r\n'I have thought of something already, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You have!'\r\n\r\n'The scheme I would suggest cannot fail of success, but it has what may\r\nseem to you a drawback, sir, in that it requires a certain financial\r\noutlay.'\r\n\r\n'He means,' I translated to Corky, 'that he has got a pippin of an\r\nidea, but it's going to cost a bit.'\r\n\r\nNaturally the poor chap's face dropped, for this seemed to dish the\r\nwhole thing. But I was still under the influence of the girl's melting\r\ngaze, and I saw that this was where I started in as the knight-errant.\r\n\r\n'You can count on me for all that sort of thing, Corky,' I said. 'Only\r\ntoo glad. Carry on, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'I would suggest, sir, that Mr Corcoran take advantage of Mr Worple's\r\nattachment to ornithology.'\r\n\r\n'How on earth did you know that he was fond of birds?'\r\n\r\n'It is the way these New York apartments are constructed, sir. Quite\r\nunlike our London houses. The partitions between the rooms are of the\r\nflimsiest nature. With no wish to overhear, I have sometimes heard Mr\r\nCorcoran expressing himself with a generous strength on the subject I\r\nhave mentioned.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! Well?'\r\n\r\n'Why should not the young lady write a small volume, to be\r\nentitled--let us say--_The Children's Book of American Birds_ and\r\ndedicate it to Mr Worple? A limited edition could be published at\r\nyour expense, sir, and a great deal of the book would, of course, be\r\ngiven over to eulogistic remarks concerning Mr Worple's own larger\r\ntreatise on the same subject. I should recommend the dispatching of a\r\npresentation copy to Mr Worple, immediately on publication, accompanied\r\nby a letter in which the young lady asks to be allowed to make the\r\nacquaintance of one to whom she owes so much. This would, I fancy,\r\nproduce the desired result, but as I say, the expense involved would be\r\nconsiderable.'\r\n\r\nI felt like the proprietor of a performing dog on the vaudeville stage\r\nwhen the tyke has just pulled off his trick without a hitch. I had\r\nbetted on Jeeves all along, and I had known that he wouldn't let me\r\ndown. It beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied to\r\nhang around pressing my clothes and what-not. If I had half Jeeves's\r\nbrain I should have a stab at being Prime Minister or something.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'that is absolutely ripping! One of your very best\r\nefforts.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe girl made an objection.\r\n\r\n'But I'm sure I couldn't write a book about anything. I can't even\r\nwrite good letters.'\r\n\r\n'Muriel's talents,' said Corky, with a little cough, 'lie more in the\r\ndirection of the drama, Bertie. I didn't mention it before, but one of\r\nour reasons for being a trifle nervous as to how Uncle Alexander will\r\nreceive the news is that Muriel is in the chorus of that show _Choose\r\nyour Exit_ at the Manhattan. It's absurdly unreasonable, but we both\r\nfeel that that fact might increase Uncle Alexander's natural tendency\r\nto kick like a steer.'\r\n\r\nI saw what he meant. I don't know why it is--one of these psychology\r\nsharps could explain it, I suppose--but uncles and aunts, as a class,\r\nare always dead against the drama, legitimate or otherwise. They don't\r\nseem able to stick it at any price.\r\n\r\nBut Jeeves had a solution, of course.\r\n\r\n'I fancy it would be a simple matter, sir, to find some impecunious\r\nauthor who would be glad to do the actual composition of the volume for\r\na small fee. It is only necessary that the young lady's name should\r\nappear on the title page.'\r\n\r\n'That's true,' said Corky. 'Sam Patterson would do it for a hundred\r\ndollars. He writes a novelette, three short stories, and ten thousand\r\nwords of a serial for one of the all-fiction magazines under different\r\nnames every month. A little thing like this would be nothing to him.\r\nI'll get after him right away.'\r\n\r\n'Fine!'\r\n\r\n'Will that be all, sir?' said Jeeves. 'Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI always used to think that publishers had to be devilish intelligent\r\nfellows, loaded down with the grey matter; but I've got their number\r\nnow. All a publisher has to do is to write cheques at intervals, while\r\na lot of deserving and industrious chappies rally round and do the real\r\nwork. I know, because I've been one myself. I simply sat tight in the\r\nold flat with a fountain-pen, and in due season a topping, shiny book\r\ncame along.\r\n\r\nI happened to be down at Corky's place when the first copies of _The\r\nChildren's Book of American Birds_ bobbed up. Muriel Singer was there,\r\nand we were talking of things in general when there was a bang at the\r\ndoor and the parcel was delivered.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly some book. It had a red cover with a fowl of some\r\nspecies on it, and underneath the girl's name in gold letters. I opened\r\na copy at random.\r\n\r\n'Often of a spring morning,' it said at the top of page twenty-one,\r\n'as you wander through the fields, you will hear the sweet-toned,\r\ncarelessly flowing warble of the purple finch linnet. When you are\r\nolder you must read all about him in Mr Alexander Worple's wonderful\r\nbook, _American Birds_.'\r\n\r\nYou see. A boost for the uncle right away. And only a few pages later\r\nthere he was in the limelight again in connexion with the yellow-billed\r\ncuckoo. It was great stuff. The more I read, the more I admired the\r\nchap who had written it and Jeeves's genius in putting us on to the\r\nwheeze. I didn't see how the uncle could fail to drop. You can't call a\r\nchap the world's greatest authority on the yellow-billed cuckoo without\r\nrousing a certain disposition towards chumminess in him.\r\n\r\n'It's a cert!' I said.\r\n\r\n'An absolute cinch!' said Corky.\r\n\r\nAnd a day or two later he meandered up the Avenue to my flat to tell me\r\nthat all was well. The uncle had written Muriel a letter so dripping\r\nwith the milk of human kindness that if he hadn't known Mr Worple's\r\nhandwriting Corky would have refused to believe him the author of it.\r\nAny time it suited Miss Singer to call, said the uncle, he would be\r\ndelighted to make her acquaintance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after this I had to go out of town. Divers sound sportsmen\r\nhad invited me to pay visits to their country places, and it wasn't\r\nfor several months that I settled down in the city again. I had been\r\nwondering a lot, of course, about Corky, whether it all turned out\r\nright, and so forth, and my first evening in New York, happening to\r\npop into a quiet sort of little restaurant which I go to when I don't\r\nfeel inclined for the bright lights, I found Muriel Singer there,\r\nsitting by herself at a table near the door. Corky, I took it, was out\r\ntelephoning. I went up and passed the time of day.\r\n\r\n'Well, well, well, what?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Why, Mr Wooster! How do you do?'\r\n\r\n'Corky around?'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon?'\r\n\r\n'You're waiting for Corky, aren't you?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I didn't understand. No, I'm not waiting for him.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that there was a sort of something in her voice, a kind\r\nof thingummy, you know.\r\n\r\n'I say, you haven't had a row with Corky, have you?'\r\n\r\n'A row?'\r\n\r\n'A spat, don't you know--little misunderstanding--faults on both\r\nsides--er--and all that sort of thing.'\r\n\r\n'Why, whatever makes you think that?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, as it were, what? What I mean is--I thought you usually\r\ndined with him before you went to the theatre.'\r\n\r\n'I've left the stage now.'\r\n\r\nSuddenly the whole thing dawned on me. I had forgotten what a long time\r\nI had been away.\r\n\r\n'Why, of course, I see now! You're married!'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'How perfectly topping! I wish you all kinds of happiness.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you so much. Oh, Alexander,' she said, looking past me, 'this is\r\na friend of mine--Mr Wooster.'\r\n\r\nI spun round. A bloke with a lot of stiff grey hair and a red sort\r\nof healthy face was standing there. Rather a formidable Johnnie, he\r\nlooked, though peaceful at the moment.\r\n\r\n'I want you to meet my husband, Mr Wooster. Mr Wooster is a friend of\r\nBruce's, Alexander.'\r\n\r\nThe old boy grasped my hand warmly, and that was all that kept me from\r\nhitting the floor in a heap. The place was rocking. Absolutely.\r\n\r\n'So you know my nephew, Mr Wooster?' I heard him say. 'I wish you would\r\ntry to knock a little sense into him and make him quit this playing at\r\npainting. But I have an idea that he is steadying down. I noticed it\r\nfirst that night he came to dinner with us, my dear, to be introduced\r\nto you. He seemed altogether quieter and more serious. Something seemed\r\nto have sobered him. Perhaps you will give us the pleasure of your\r\ncompany at dinner tonight, Mr Wooster? Or have you dined?'\r\n\r\nI said I had. What I needed then was air, not dinner. I felt that I\r\nwanted to get into the open and think this thing out.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached my flat I heard Jeeves moving about in his lair. I\r\ncalled him.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'now is the time for all good men to come to the aid\r\nof the party. A stiff b-and-s first of all, and then I've a bit of news\r\nfor you.'\r\n\r\nHe came back with a tray and a long glass.\r\n\r\n'Better have one yourself, Jeeves. You'll need it.'\r\n\r\n'Later on, perhaps, thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'All right. Please yourself. But you're going to get a shock. You\r\nremember my friend, Mr Corcoran?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And the girl who was to slide gracefully into his uncle's esteem by\r\nwriting the book on birds?'\r\n\r\n'Perfectly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, she's slid. She's married the uncle.'\r\n\r\nHe took it without blinking. You can't rattle Jeeves.\r\n\r\n'That was always a development to be feared, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean to tell me that you were expecting it?'\r\n\r\n'It crossed my mind as a possibility.'\r\n\r\n'Did it, by Jove! Well, I think you might have warned us!'\r\n\r\n'I hardly liked to take the liberty, sir.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course, as I saw after I had had a bite to eat and was in a calmer\r\nframe of mind, what had happened wasn't my fault, if you came down to\r\nit. I couldn't be expected to foresee that the scheme, in itself a\r\ncracker-jack, would skid into the ditch as it had done; but all the\r\nsame I'm bound to admit that I didn't relish the idea of meeting Corky\r\nagain until time, the great healer, had been able to get in a bit of\r\nsoothing work. I cut Washington Square out absolutely for the next few\r\nmonths. I gave it the complete miss-in-baulk. And then, just when I\r\nwas beginning to think I might safely pop down in that direction and\r\ngather up the dropped threads, so to speak, time, instead of working\r\nthe healing wheeze, went and pulled the most awful bone and put the lid\r\non it. Opening the paper one morning, I read that Mrs Alexander Worple\r\nhad presented her husband with a son and heir.\r\n\r\nI was so dashed sorry for poor old Corky that I hadn't the heart to\r\ntouch my breakfast. I was bowled over. Absolutely. It was the limit.\r\n\r\nI hardly knew what to do. I wanted, of course, to rush down to\r\nWashington Square and grip the poor blighter silently by the hand; and\r\nthen, thinking it over, I hadn't the nerve. Absent treatment seemed the\r\ntouch. I gave it him in waves.\r\n\r\nBut after a month or so I began to hesitate again. It struck me that\r\nit was playing it a bit low-down on the poor chap, avoiding him like\r\nthis just when he probably wanted his pals to surge round him most.\r\nI pictured him sitting in his lonely studio with no company but his\r\nbitter thoughts, and the pathos of it got me to such an extent that I\r\nbounded straight into a taxi and told the driver to go all out for the\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\nI rushed in, and there was Corky, hunched up at the easel, painting\r\naway, while on the model throne sat a severe-looking female of middle\r\nage, holding a baby.\r\n\r\nA fellow has to be ready for that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n'Oh, ah!' I said, and started to back out.\r\n\r\nCorky looked over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, Bertie. Don't go. We're just finishing for the day. That will\r\nbe all this afternoon,' he said to the nurse, who got up with the baby\r\nand decanted it into a perambulator which was standing in the fairway.\r\n\r\n'At the same hour tomorrow, Mr Corcoran?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, please.'\r\n\r\n'Good afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'Good afternoon.'\r\n\r\nCorky stood there, looking at the door, and then he turned to me and\r\nbegan to get it off his chest. Fortunately, he seemed to take it for\r\ngranted that I knew all about what had happened, so it wasn't as\r\nawkward as it might have been.\r\n\r\n'It's my uncle's idea,' he said. 'Muriel doesn't know about it yet. The\r\nportrait's to be a surprise for her on her birthday. The nurse takes\r\nthe kid out ostensibly to get a breather, and they beat it down here.\r\nIf you want an instance of the irony of fate, Bertie, get acquainted\r\nwith this. Here's the first commission I have ever had to paint a\r\nportrait, and the sitter is that human poached egg that has butted\r\nin and bounced me out of my inheritance. Can you beat it! I call it\r\nrubbing the thing in to expect me to spend my afternoons gazing into\r\nthe ugly face of a little brat who to all intents and purposes has hit\r\nme behind the ear with a black-jack and swiped all I possess. I can't\r\nrefuse to paint the portrait, because if I did my uncle would stop my\r\nallowance; yet every time I look up and catch that kid's vacant eye,\r\nI suffer agonies. I tell you, Bertie, sometimes when he gives me a\r\npatronizing glance and then turns away and is sick, as if it revolted\r\nhim to look at me, I come within an ace of occupying the entire front\r\npage of the evening papers as the latest murder sensation. There are\r\nmoments when I can almost see the headlines: \"Promising Young Artist\r\nBeans Baby With Axe.\"'\r\n\r\nI patted his shoulder silently. My sympathy for the poor old scout was\r\ntoo deep for words.\r\n\r\nI kept away from the studio for some time after that, because it didn't\r\nseem right to me to intrude on the poor chappie's sorrow. Besides, I'm\r\nbound to say that nurse intimidated me. She reminded me so infernally\r\nof Aunt Agatha. She was the same gimlet-eyed type.\r\n\r\nBut one afternoon Corky called me on the phone.\r\n\r\n'Bertie!'\r\n\r\n'Hallo?'\r\n\r\n'Are you doing anything this afternoon?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing special.'\r\n\r\n'You couldn't come down here, could you?'\r\n\r\n'What's the trouble? Anything up?'\r\n\r\n'I've finished the portrait.'\r\n\r\n'Good boy! Stout work!'\r\n\r\n'Yes.' His voice sounded rather doubtful. 'The fact is, Bertie, it\r\ndoesn't look quite right to me. There's something about it--My uncle's\r\ncoming in half an hour to inspect it, and--I don't know why it is, but\r\nI kind of feel I'd like your moral support!'\r\n\r\nI began to see that I was letting myself in for something. The\r\nsympathetic cooperation of Jeeves seemed to me to be indicated.\r\n\r\n'You think he'll cut up rough?'\r\n\r\n'He may.'\r\n\r\nI threw my mind back to the red-faced chappie I had met at the\r\nrestaurant, and tried to picture him cutting up rough. It was only too\r\neasy. I spoke to Corky firmly on the telephone.\r\n\r\n'I'll come,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Good!'\r\n\r\n'But only if I may bring Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Why Jeeves? What's Jeeves got to do with it? Who wants Jeeves? Jeeves\r\nis the fool who suggested the scheme that has led--'\r\n\r\n'Listen, Corky, old top! If you think I am going to face that uncle of\r\nyours without Jeeves's support, you're mistaken. I'd sooner go into a\r\nden of wild beasts and bite a lion on the back of the neck.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' said Corky. Not cordially, but he said it; so I rang\r\nfor Jeeves, and explained the situation.\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir,' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe found Corky near the door, looking at the picture with one hand up\r\nin a defensive sort of way, as if he thought it might swing on him.\r\n\r\n'Stand right where you are, Bertie,' he said, without moving. 'Now,\r\ntell me honestly, how does it strike you?'\r\n\r\nThe light from the big window fell right on the picture. I took a good\r\nlook at it. Then I shifted a bit nearer and took another look. Then I\r\nwent back to where I had been at first, because it hadn't seemed quite\r\nso bad from there.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Corky anxiously.\r\n\r\nI hesitated a bit.\r\n\r\n'Of course, old man, I only saw the kid once, and then only for a\r\nmoment, but--but it _was_ an ugly sort of kid, wasn't it, if I remember\r\nrightly?'\r\n\r\n'As ugly as that?'\r\n\r\nI looked again, and honesty compelled me to be frank.\r\n\r\n'I don't see how it could have been, old chap.'\r\n\r\nPoor old Corky ran his fingers through his hair in a temperamental sort\r\nof way. He groaned.\r\n\r\n'You're quite right, Bertie. Something's gone wrong with the darned\r\nthing. My private impression is that, without knowing it, I've worked\r\nthat stunt that Sargent used to pull--painting the soul of the sitter.\r\nI've got through the mere outward appearance, and have put the child's\r\nsoul on canvas.'\r\n\r\n'But could a child of that age have a soul like that? I don't see how\r\nhe could have managed it in the time. What do you think, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'I doubt it, sir.'\r\n\r\n'It--it sort of leers at you, doesn't it?'\r\n\r\n'You've noticed that, too?' said Corky.\r\n\r\n'I don't see how one could help noticing.'\r\n\r\n'All I tried to do was to give the little brute a cheerful expression.\r\nBut, as it has worked out, he looks positively dissipated.'\r\n\r\n'Just what I was going to suggest, old man. He looks as if he were in\r\nthe middle of a colossal spree, and enjoying every minute of it. Don't\r\nyou think so, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'He has a decidedly inebriated air, sir.'\r\n\r\nCorky was starting to say something, when the door opened and the uncle\r\ncame in.\r\n\r\nFor about three seconds all was joy, jollity and goodwill. The old boy\r\nshook hands with me, slapped Corky on the back, said he didn't think\r\nhe had ever seen such a fine day, and whacked his leg with his stick.\r\nJeeves had projected himself into the background, and he didn't notice\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Well, Bruce, my boy; so the portrait is really finished, is it--really\r\nfinished? Well, bring it out. Let's have a look at it. This will be a\r\nwonderful surprise for your aunt. Where is it? Let's--'\r\n\r\nAnd then he got it--suddenly, when he wasn't set for the punch; and he\r\nrocked back on his heels.\r\n\r\n'Oosh!' he exclaimed. And for perhaps a minute there was one of the\r\nscaliest silences I've ever run up against.\r\n\r\n'Is this a practical joke?' he said at last, in a way that set about\r\nsixteen draughts cutting through the room at once.\r\n\r\nI thought it was up to me to rally round old Corky.\r\n\r\n'You want to stand a bit farther away from it,' I said.\r\n\r\n'You're perfectly right!' he snorted. 'I do! I want to stand so far\r\naway from it that I can't see the thing with a telescope!' He turned\r\non Corky like an untamed tiger of the jungle who has just located a\r\nchunk of meat. 'And this--this--is what you have been wasting your\r\ntime and my money for all these years! A painter! I wouldn't let you\r\npaint a house of mine. I gave you this commission, thinking that you\r\nwere a competent worker, and this--this--this extract from a comic\r\nsupplement is the result!' He swung towards the door, lashing his tail\r\nand growling to himself. 'This ends it. If you wish to continue this\r\nfoolery of pretending to be an artist because you want an excuse for\r\nidleness, please yourself. But let me tell you this. Unless you report\r\nat my office on Monday morning, prepared to abandon all this idiocy\r\nand start in at the bottom of the business to work your way up, as you\r\nshould have done half a dozen years ago, not another cent--not another\r\ncent--not another--Boosh!'\r\n\r\nThen the door closed and he was no longer with us. And I crawled out of\r\nthe bomb-proof shelter.\r\n\r\n'Corky, old top!' I whispered faintly.\r\n\r\nCorky was standing staring at the picture. His face was set. There was\r\na hunted look in his eye.\r\n\r\n'Well, that finishes it!' he muttered brokenly.\r\n\r\n'What are you going to do?'\r\n\r\n'Do? What can I do? I can't stick on here if he cuts off supplies. You\r\nheard what he said. I shall have to go to the office on Monday.'\r\n\r\nI couldn't think of a thing to say. I knew exactly how he felt about\r\nthe office. I don't know when I've been so infernally uncomfortable. It\r\nwas like hanging round trying to make conversation to a pal who's just\r\nbeen sentenced to twenty years in quod.\r\n\r\nAnd then a soothing voice broke the silence.\r\n\r\n'If I might make a suggestion, sir!'\r\n\r\nIt was Jeeves. He had slid from the shadows and was gazing gravely\r\nat the picture. Upon my word, I can't give you a better idea of the\r\nshattering effect of Corky's Uncle Alexander when in action than by\r\nsaying that he had absolutely made me forget for the moment that Jeeves\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\n'I wonder if I have ever happened to mention to you, sir, a Mr Digby\r\nThistleton, with whom I was once in service? Perhaps you have met him?\r\nHe was a financier. He is now Lord Bridgworth. It was a favourite\r\nsaying of his that there is always a way. The first time I heard him\r\nuse the expression was after the failure of a patent depilatory which\r\nhe promoted.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'what on earth are you talking about?'\r\n\r\n'I mentioned Mr Thistleton, sir, because his was in some respects a\r\nparallel case to the present one. His depilatory failed, but he did\r\nnot despair. He put it on the market again under the name of Hair-o,\r\nguaranteed to produce a full crop of hair in a few months. It was\r\nadvertised, if you remember, sir, by a humorous picture of a billiard\r\nball, before and after taking, and made such a substantial fortune that\r\nMr Thistleton was soon afterwards elevated to the peerage for services\r\nto his Party. It seems to me that, if Mr Corcoran looks into the\r\nmatter, he will find, like Mr Thistleton, that there is always a way.\r\nMr Worple himself suggested the solution of the difficulty. In the heat\r\nof the moment he compared the portrait to an extract from a coloured\r\ncomic supplement. I consider the suggestion a very valuable one, sir.\r\nMr Corcoran's portrait may not have pleased Mr Worple as a likeness of\r\nhis only child, but I have no doubt that editors would gladly consider\r\nit as a foundation for a series of humorous drawings. If Mr Corcoran\r\nwill allow me to make the suggestion, his talent has always been for\r\nthe humorous. There is something about this picture--something bold and\r\nvigorous, which arrests the attention. I feel sure it would be highly\r\npopular.'\r\n\r\nCorky was glaring at the picture, and making a sort of dry, sucking\r\nnoise with his mouth. He seemed completely overwrought.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly he began to laugh in a wild way.\r\n\r\n'Corky, old man!' I said, massaging him tenderly. I feared the poor\r\nblighter was hysterical.\r\n\r\nHe began to stagger about all over the floor.\r\n\r\n'He's right! The man's absolutely right! Jeeves, you're a life-saver.\r\nYou've hit on the greatest idea of the age. Report at the office on\r\nMonday! Start at the bottom of the business! I'll buy the business if I\r\nfeel like it. I know the man who runs the comic section of the _Sunday\r\nStar_. He'll eat this thing. He was telling me only the other day how\r\nhard it was to get a good new series. He'll give me anything I ask for\r\na real winner like this. I've got a gold mine. Where's my hat? I've\r\ngot an income for life! Where's that confounded hat? Lend me a five,\r\nBertie. I want to take a taxi down to Park Row!'\r\n\r\nJeeves smiled paternally. Or, rather, he had a kind of paternal\r\nmuscular spasm about the mouth, which is the nearest he ever gets to\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n'If I might make the suggestion, Mr Corcoran--for a title of the series\r\nwhich you have in mind--\"The Adventures of Baby Blobbs\".'\r\n\r\nCorky and I looked at the picture, then at each other in an awed way.\r\nJeeves was right. There could be no other title.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said. It was a few weeks later, and I had just finished\r\nlooking at the comic section of the _Sunday Star_. 'I'm an optimist. I\r\nalways have been. The older I get, the more I agree with Shakespeare\r\nand those poet Johnnies about it always being darkest before the dawn\r\nand there's a silver lining and what you lose on the swings you make\r\nup on the roundabouts. Look at Mr Corcoran, for instance. There was a\r\nfellow, one would have said, clear up to the eyebrows in the soup. To\r\nall appearances he had got it right in the neck. Yet look at him now.\r\nHave you seen these pictures?'\r\n\r\n'I took the liberty of glancing at them before bringing them to you,\r\nsir. Extremely diverting.'\r\n\r\n'They have made a big hit, you know.'\r\n\r\n'I anticipated it, sir.'\r\n\r\nI leaned back against the pillows.\r\n\r\n'You know, Jeeves, you're a genius. You ought to be drawing a\r\ncommission on these things.'\r\n\r\n'I have nothing to complain of in that respect, sir. Mr Corcoran has\r\nbeen most generous. I am putting out the brown suit, sir.'\r\n\r\n'No, I think I'll wear the blue with the faint red stripe.'\r\n\r\n'Not the blue with the faint red stripe, sir.'\r\n\r\n'But I rather fancy myself in it.'\r\n\r\n'Not the blue with the faint red stripe, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right, have it your own way.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   3--Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it's\r\nShakespeare--or, if not, it's some equally brainy bird--who says that\r\nit's always just when a fellow is feeling particularly braced with\r\nthings in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with the bit of lead\r\npiping. And what I'm driving at is that the man is perfectly right.\r\nTake, for instance, the business of Lady Malvern and her son Wilmot.\r\nThat was one of the scaliest affairs I was ever mixed up with, and a\r\nmoment before they came into my life I was just thinking how thoroughly\r\nall right everything was.\r\n\r\nI was still in New York when the thing started, and it was about\r\nthe time of year when New York is at its best. It was one of those\r\ntopping mornings, and I had just climbed out from under the cold\r\nshower, feeling like a million dollars. As a matter of fact, what was\r\nbucking me up more than anything was the fact that the day before I\r\nhad asserted myself with Jeeves--absolutely asserted myself, don't you\r\nknow. You see, the way things had been going on I was rapidly becoming\r\na dashed serf. The man had jolly well oppressed me. I didn't so much\r\nmind when he made me give up one of my new suits, because Jeeves's\r\njudgement about suits is sound and can generally be relied upon.\r\n\r\nBut I as near as a toucher rebelled when he wouldn't let me wear a pair\r\nof cloth-topped boots which I loved like a couple of brothers. And,\r\nfinally, when he tried to tread on me like a worm in the matter of a\r\nhat, I put the Wooster foot down and showed him in no uncertain manner\r\nwho was who.\r\n\r\nIt's a long story, and I haven't time to tell you now, but the nub of\r\nthe thing was that he wanted me to wear the White House Wonder--as worn\r\nby President Coolidge--when I had set my heart on the Broadway Special,\r\nmuch patronized by the Younger Set; and the end of the matter was that,\r\nafter a rather painful scene, I bought the Broadway Special. So that's\r\nhow things were on this particular morning, and I was feeling pretty\r\nmanly and independent.\r\n\r\nWell, I was in the bathroom, wondering what there was going to be\r\nfor breakfast while I massaged the spine with a rough towel and sang\r\nslightly, when there was a tap at the door. I stopped singing and\r\nopened the door an inch.\r\n\r\n'What ho, without there!' I said.\r\n\r\n'Lady Malvern has called, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'Lady Malvern, sir. She is waiting in the sitting-room.'\r\n\r\n'Pull yourself together, Jeeves, my man,' I said rather severely, for I\r\nbar practical jokes before breakfast. 'You know perfectly well there's\r\nno one waiting for me in the sitting-room. How could there be when it's\r\nbarely ten o'clock yet?'\r\n\r\n'I gathered from her ladyship, sir, that she had landed from an ocean\r\nliner at an early hour this morning.'\r\n\r\nThis made the thing a bit more plausible. I remembered that when I\r\nhad arrived in America about a year before, the proceedings had begun\r\nat some ghastly hour like six, and that I had been shot out on to a\r\nforeign shore considerably before eight.\r\n\r\n'Who the deuce is Lady Malvern, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Her ladyship did not confide in me, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Is she alone?'\r\n\r\n'Her ladyship is accompanied by a Lord Pershore, sir. I fancy that his\r\nlordship would be her ladyship's son.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, put out rich raiment of sorts, and I'll be dressing.'\r\n\r\n'Our heather-mixture lounge is in readiness, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Then lead me to it.'\r\n\r\nWhile I was dressing I kept trying to think who on earth Lady Malvern\r\ncould be. It wasn't till I had climbed through the top of my shirt and\r\nwas reaching out for the studs that I remembered.\r\n\r\n'I've placed her, Jeeves. She's a pal of my Aunt Agatha.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. I met her at lunch one Sunday before I left London. A very\r\nvicious specimen. Writes books. She wrote a book on social conditions\r\nin India when she came back from the Durbar.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir? Pardon me, sir, but not that tie.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'Not that tie with the heather-mixture lounge, sir.'\r\n\r\nIt was a shock to me. I thought I had quelled the fellow. It was rather\r\na solemn moment. What I mean is, if I weakened now, all my good work\r\nthe night before would be thrown away. I braced myself.\r\n\r\n'What's wrong with this tie? I've seen you give it a nasty look before.\r\nSpeak out like a man! What's the matter with it?'\r\n\r\n'Too ornate, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense! A cheerful pink. Nothing more.'\r\n\r\n'Unsuitable, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, this is the tie I wear!'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nDashed unpleasant. I could see that the man was wounded. But I was\r\nfirm. I tied the tie, got into the coat and waistcoat, and went into\r\nthe sitting-room.\r\n\r\n'Hullo-ullo-ullo!' I said. 'What?'\r\n\r\n'Ah! How do you do, Mr Wooster? You have never met my son Wilmot, I\r\nthink? Motty, darling, this is Mr Wooster.'\r\n\r\nLady Malvern was a hearty, happy, healthy, overpowering sort of dashed\r\nfemale, not so very tall but making up for it by measuring about six\r\nfeet from the O. P. to the Prompt Side. She fitted into my biggest\r\narm-chair as if it had been built round her by someone who knew they\r\nwere wearing arm-chairs tight about the hips that season. She had\r\nbright, bulging eyes and a lot of yellow hair, and when she spoke she\r\nshowed about fifty-seven front teeth. She was one of those women who\r\nkind of numb a fellow's faculties. She made me feel as if I were ten\r\nyears old and had been brought into the drawing-room in my Sunday\r\nclothes to say how-d'you-do. Altogether by no means the sort of thing a\r\nchappie would wish to find in his sitting-room before breakfast.\r\n\r\nMotty, the son, was about twenty-three, tall and thin and meek-looking.\r\nHe had the same yellow hair as his mother, but he wore it plastered\r\ndown and parted in the middle. His eyes bulged, too, but they weren't\r\nbright. They were a dull grey with pink rims. His chin gave up the\r\nstruggle about half-way down, and he didn't appear to have any\r\neyelashes. A mild, furtive, sheepish sort of blighter, in short.\r\n\r\n'Awfully glad to see you,' I said, though this was far from the case,\r\nfor already I was beginning to have a sort of feeling that dirty work\r\nwas threatening in the offing. 'So you've popped over, eh? Making a\r\nlong stay in America?'\r\n\r\n'About a month. Your aunt gave me your address and told me to be sure\r\nto call on you.'\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear this, for it seemed to indicate that Aunt Agatha\r\nwas beginning to come round a bit. As I believe I told you before,\r\nthere had been some slight unpleasantness between us, arising from the\r\noccasion when she had sent me over to New York to disentangle my cousin\r\nGussie from the clutches of a girl on the music-hall stage. When I tell\r\nyou that by the time I had finished my operations Gussie had not only\r\nmarried the girl but had gone on the Halls himself and was doing well,\r\nyou'll understand that relations were a trifle strained between aunt\r\nand nephew.\r\n\r\nI simply hadn't dared go back and face her, and it was a relief to\r\nfind that time had healed the wound enough to make her tell her pals\r\nto call on me. What I mean is, much as I liked America, I didn't want\r\nto have England barred to me for the rest of my natural; and, believe\r\nme, England is a jolly sight too small for anyone to live in with Aunt\r\nAgatha, if she's really on the war-path. So I was braced at hearing\r\nthese words and smiled genially on the assemblage.\r\n\r\n'Your aunt said that you would do anything that was in your power to be\r\nof assistance to us.'\r\n\r\n'Rather! Oh, rather. Absolutely.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you so much. I want you to put dear Motty up for a little while.'\r\n\r\nI didn't get this for a moment.\r\n\r\n'Put him up? For my clubs?'\r\n\r\n'No, no! Darling Motty is essentially a home bird. Aren't you, Motty,\r\ndarling?'\r\n\r\nMotty, who was sucking the knob of his stick, uncorked himself.\r\n\r\n'Yes, mother,' he said, and corked himself up again.\r\n\r\n'I should not like him to belong to clubs. I mean put him up here. Have\r\nhim to live with you while I am away.'\r\n\r\nThese frightful words trickled out of her like honey. The woman simply\r\ndidn't seem to understand the ghastly nature of her proposal. I gave\r\nMotty the swift east-to-west. He was sitting with his mouth nuzzling\r\nthe stick, blinking at the wall. The thought of having this planted on\r\nme for an indefinite period appalled me. Absolutely appalled me, don't\r\nyou know. I was just starting to say that the shot wasn't on the board\r\nat any price, and that the first sign Motty gave of trying to nestle\r\ninto my little home I would yell for the police, when she went on,\r\nrolling placidly over me, as it were.\r\n\r\nThere was something about this woman that sapped one's will-power.\r\n\r\n'I am leaving New York by the midday train, as I have to pay a visit\r\nto Sing-Sing prison. I am extremely interested in prison conditions\r\nin America. After that I work my way gradually across to the coast,\r\nvisiting the points of interest on the journey. You see, Mr Wooster,\r\nI am in America principally on business. No doubt you read my book,\r\n_India and the Indians_? My publishers are anxious for me to write a\r\ncompanion volume on the United States. I shall not be able to spend\r\nmore than a month in the country, as I have to get back for the season,\r\nbut a month should be ample. I was less than a month in India, and my\r\ndear friend Sir Roger Cremorne wrote his _America from Within_ after a\r\nstay of only two weeks. I should love to take dear Motty with me, but\r\nthe poor boy gets so sick when he travels by train. I shall have to\r\npick him up on my return.'\r\n\r\nFrom where I sat I could see Jeeves in the dining-room, laying the\r\nbreakfast-table. I wished I could have had a minute with him alone.\r\nI felt certain that he would have been able to think of some way of\r\nputting a stop to this woman.\r\n\r\n'It will be such a relief to know that Motty is safe with you, Mr\r\nWooster. I know what the temptations of a great city are. Hitherto dear\r\nMotty has been sheltered from them. He has lived quietly with me in the\r\ncountry. I know that you will look after him carefully, Mr Wooster.\r\nHe will give very little trouble.' She talked about the poor blighter\r\nas if he wasn't there. Not that Motty seemed to mind. He had stopped\r\nchewing his walking-stick and was sitting there with his mouth open.\r\n'He is a vegetarian and a teetotaller and is devoted to reading. Give\r\nhim a nice book and he will be quite contented.' She got up. 'Thank\r\nyou so much, Mr Wooster. I don't know what I should have done without\r\nyour help. Come, Motty. We have just time to see a few of the sights\r\nbefore my train goes. But I shall have to rely on you for most of my\r\ninformation about New York, darling. Be sure to keep your eyes open and\r\ntake notes of your impressions. It will be such a help. Good-bye, Mr\r\nWooster. I will send Motty back early in the afternoon.'\r\n\r\nThey went out, and I howled for Jeeves.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'What's to be done? You heard it all, didn't you? You were in the\r\ndining-room most of the time. That pill is coming to stay here.'\r\n\r\n'Pill, sir?'\r\n\r\n'The excrescence.'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon, sir?'\r\n\r\nI looked at Jeeves sharply. This sort of thing wasn't like him. Then I\r\nunderstood. The man was really upset about that tie. He was trying to\r\nget his own back.\r\n\r\n'Lord Pershore will be staying here from tonight, Jeeves,' I said\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir. Breakfast is ready, sir.'\r\n\r\nI could have sobbed into the bacon and eggs. That there wasn't any\r\nsympathy to be got out of Jeeves was what put the lid on it. For a\r\nmoment I almost weakened and told him to destroy the hat and tie if he\r\ndidn't like them, but I pulled myself together again. I was dashed if I\r\nwas going to let Jeeves treat me like a bally one-man chain-gang.\r\n\r\nBut, what with brooding on Jeeves and brooding on Motty, I was in a\r\npretty reduced sort of state. The more I examined the situation, the\r\nmore blighted it became. There was nothing I could do. If I slung Motty\r\nout, he would report to his mother, and she would pass it on to Aunt\r\nAgatha, and I didn't like to think what would happen then. Sooner or\r\nlater I should be wanting to go back to England, and I didn't want\r\nto get there and find Aunt Agatha waiting on the quay for me with a\r\nstuffed eelskin. There was absolutely nothing for it but to put the\r\nfellow up and make the best of it.\r\n\r\nAbout midday Motty's luggage arrived, and soon afterwards a large\r\nparcel of what I took to be nice books. I brightened up a little when\r\nI saw it. It was one of those massive parcels and looked as if it\r\nhad enough in it to keep him busy for a year. I felt a trifle more\r\ncheerful, and I got my Broadway Special and stuck it on my head, and\r\ngave the pink tie a twist, and reeled out to take a bite of lunch\r\nwith one or two of the lads at a neighbouring hostelry; and what with\r\nexcellent browsing and sluicing and cheery conversation and what-not,\r\nthe afternoon passed quite happily. By dinner-time I had almost\r\nforgotten Motty's existence.\r\n\r\nI dined at the club and looked in at a show afterwards, and it wasn't\r\ntill fairly late that I got back to the flat. There were no signs of\r\nMotty, and I took it that he had gone to bed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed rummy to me, though, that the parcel of nice books was still\r\nthere with the string and paper on it. It looked as if Motty, after\r\nseeing mother off at the station, had decided to call it a day.\r\n\r\nJeeves came in with the nightly whisky and soda. I could tell by the\r\nchappie's manner that he was still upset.\r\n\r\n'Lord Pershore gone to bed, Jeeves?' I asked, with reserved hauteur and\r\nwhat-not.\r\n\r\n'No sir. His lordship has not yet returned.'\r\n\r\n'Not returned? What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'His lordship came in shortly after six-thirty, and, having dressed,\r\nwent out again.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a noise outside the front door, a sort of\r\nscrabbling noise, as if somebody were trying to paw his way through the\r\nwoodwork. Then a sort of thud.\r\n\r\n'Better go and see what that is, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nHe went out and came back again.\r\n\r\n'If you would not mind stepping this way sir, I think we might be able\r\nto carry him in.'\r\n\r\n'Carry him in?'\r\n\r\n'His lordship is lying on the mat, sir.'\r\n\r\nI went to the front door. The man was right. There was Motty huddled up\r\noutside on the floor. He was moaning a bit.\r\n\r\n'He's had some sort of dashed fit,' I said. I took another look.\r\n'Jeeves! Someone's been feeding him meat!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'He's a vegetarian, you know. He must have been digging into a steak or\r\nsomething. Call up a doctor!'\r\n\r\n'I hardly think it will be necessary, sir. If you would take his\r\nlordship's legs, while I--'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott, Jeeves! You don't think--he can't be--'\r\n\r\n'I am inclined to think so, sir.'\r\n\r\nAnd, by Jove, he was right! Once on the right track, you couldn't\r\nmistake it. Motty was under the surface. Completely sozzled.\r\n\r\nIt was the deuce of a shock.\r\n\r\n'You never can tell, Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Very seldom, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Remove the eye of authority and where are you?'\r\n\r\n'Precisely, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Where is my wandering boy tonight and all that sort of thing, what?'\r\n\r\n'It would seem so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, we had better bring him in, eh?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nSo we lugged him in, and Jeeves put him to bed, and I lit a cigarette\r\nand sat down to think the thing over. I had a kind of foreboding. It\r\nseemed to me that I had let myself in for something pretty rocky.\r\n\r\nNext morning, after I had sucked down a thoughtful cup of tea, I went\r\ninto Motty's room to investigate. I expected to find the fellow a\r\nwreck, but there he was, sitting up in bed, quite chirpy, reading\r\n_Gingery Stories_.\r\n\r\n'What ho!' I said.\r\n\r\n'What ho!' said Motty.\r\n\r\n'What ho! What ho!'\r\n\r\n'What ho! What ho! What ho!'\r\n\r\nAfter that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation.\r\n\r\n'How are you feeling this morning?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Topping!' replied Motty, blithely and with abandon. 'I say, you know,\r\nthat fellow of yours--Jeeves, you know--is a corker. I had a most\r\nfrightful headache when I woke up, and he brought me a sort of rummy\r\ndark drink, and it put me right again at once. Said it was his own\r\ninvention. I must see more of that lad. He seems to me distinctly one\r\nof the ones.'\r\n\r\nI couldn't believe that this was the same blighter who had sat and\r\nsucked his stick the day before.\r\n\r\n'You ate something that disagreed with you last night, didn't you?' I\r\nsaid, by way of giving him a chance to slide out of it if he wanted to.\r\nBut he wouldn't have it at any price.\r\n\r\n'No!' he replied firmly. 'I didn't do anything of the kind. I drank\r\ntoo much. Much too much. Lots and lots too much. And, what's more, I'm\r\ngoing to do it again. I'm going to do it every night. If ever you see\r\nme sober, old top,' he said, with a kind of holy exaltation, 'tap me\r\non the shoulder and say, \"Tut! Tut!\" and I'll apologize and remedy the\r\ndefect.'\r\n\r\n'But I say, you know, what about me?'\r\n\r\n'What about you?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm, so to speak, as it were, kind of responsible for you. What\r\nI mean to say is, if you go doing this sort of thing I'm apt to get in\r\nthe soup somewhat.'\r\n\r\n'I can't help your troubles,' said Motty firmly. 'Listen to me, old\r\nthing: this is the first time in my life that I've had a real chance to\r\nyield to the temptations of a great city. What's the use of a great\r\ncity having temptations if fellows don't yield to them? Makes it so\r\nbally discouraging for the great city. Besides, mother told me to keep\r\nmy eyes open and collect impressions.'\r\n\r\nI sat on the edge of the bed. I felt dizzy.\r\n\r\n'I know just how you feel, old dear,' said Motty consolingly. 'And,\r\nif my principles would permit it, I would simmer down for your sake.\r\nBut duty first! This is the first time I've been let out alone, and I\r\nmean to make the most of it. We're only young once. Why interfere with\r\nlife's morning? Young man, rejoice in thy youth! Tra-la! What ho!'\r\n\r\nPut like that, it did seem reasonable.\r\n\r\n'All my bally life, dear boy,' Motty went on, 'I've been cooped up in\r\nthe ancestral home at Much Middlefold, in Shropshire, and till you've\r\nbeen cooped up in Much Middlefold you don't know what cooping is. The\r\nonly time we get any excitement is when one of the choir-boys is caught\r\nsucking chocolate during the sermon. When that happens, we talk about\r\nit for days. I've got about a month of New York, and I mean to store\r\nup a few happy memories for the long winter evenings. This is my only\r\nchance to collect a past, and I'm going to do it. Now tell me, old\r\nsport, as man to man, how does one get in touch with that very decent\r\nbird Jeeves? Does one ring a bell or shout a bit? I should like to\r\ndiscuss the subject of a good stiff b-and-s with him.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had had a sort of vague idea, don't you know, that if I stuck close\r\nto Motty and went about the place with him, I might act as a bit of a\r\ndamper on the gaiety. What I mean is, I thought that if, when he was\r\nbeing the life and soul of the party, he were to catch my reproving eye\r\nhe might ease up a trifle on the revelry. So the next night I took him\r\nalong to supper with me. It was the last time. I'm a quiet, peaceful\r\nsort of bloke who has lived all his life in London, and I can't stand\r\nthe pace these swift sportsmen from the rural districts set. What I\r\nmean to say is, I'm all for rational enjoyment and so forth, but I\r\nthink a chappie makes himself conspicuous when he throws soft-boiled\r\neggs at the electric fan. And decent mirth and all that sort of thing\r\nare all right, but I do bar dancing on tables and having to dash all\r\nover the place dodging waiters, managers, and chuckers-out, just when\r\nyou want to sit still and digest.\r\n\r\nDirectly I managed to tear myself away that night and get home, I made\r\nup my mind that this was jolly well the last time that I went about\r\nwith Motty. The only time I met him late at night after that was once\r\nwhen I passed the door of a fairly low-down sort of restaurant and had\r\nto step aside to dodge him as he sailed through the air _en route_ for\r\nthe opposite pavement, with a muscular sort of looking fellow peering\r\nout after him with a kind of gloomy satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn a way, I couldn't help sympathizing with the chap. He had about\r\nfour weeks to have the good time that ought to have been spread over\r\nabout ten years, and I didn't wonder at his wanting to be pretty busy.\r\nI should have been just the same in his place. Still, there was no\r\ndenying that it was a bit thick. If it hadn't been for the thought of\r\nLady Malvern and Aunt Agatha in the background, I should have regarded\r\nMotty's rapid work with an indulgent smile. But I couldn't get rid of\r\nthe feeling that, sooner or later, I was the lad who was scheduled\r\nto get it behind the ear. And what with brooding on this prospect,\r\nand sitting up in the old flat waiting for the familiar footstep, and\r\nputting it to bed when it got there, and stealing into the sick-chamber\r\nnext morning to contemplate the wreckage, I was beginning to lose\r\nweight. Absolutely becoming the good old shadow, I give you my honest\r\nword. Starting at sudden noises and what-not.\r\n\r\nAnd no sympathy from Jeeves. That was what cut me to the quick. The man\r\nwas still thoroughly pipped about the hat and tie, and simply wouldn't\r\nrally round. One morning I wanted comforting so much that I sank the\r\npride of the Woosters and appealed to the fellow direct.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'this is getting a bit thick!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'You know what I mean. This lad seems to have chucked all the\r\nprinciples of a well-spent boyhood. He has got it up his nose!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I shall get blamed, don't you know. You know what my Aunt Agatha\r\nis.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Very well, then.'\r\n\r\nI waited a moment, but he wouldn't unbend.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'haven't you any scheme up your sleeve for coping\r\nwith this blighter?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\nAnd he shimmered off to his lair. Obstinate devil! So dashed absurd,\r\ndon't you know. It wasn't as if there was anything wrong with that\r\nBroadway Special hat. It was a remarkably priceless effort, and much\r\nadmired by the lads. But, just because he preferred the White House\r\nWonder, he left me flat.\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after this that young Motty got the idea of bringing\r\npals back in the small hours to continue the gay revels in the home.\r\nThis was where I began to crack under the strain. You see, the part\r\nof town where I was living wasn't the right place for that sort of\r\nthing. I knew lots of chappies down Washington Square way who started\r\nthe evening at about two a.m.--artists and writers and so forth who\r\nfrolicked considerably till checked by the arrival of the morning\r\nmilk. That was all right. They like that sort of thing down there. The\r\nneighbours can't get to sleep unless there's someone dancing Hawaiian\r\ndances over their heads. But on Fifty-seventh Street the atmosphere\r\nwasn't right, and when Motty turned up at three in the morning with a\r\ncollection of hearty lads, who only stopped singing their college song\r\nwhen they started singing 'The Old Oaken Bucket', there was a marked\r\npeevishness among the old settlers in the flats. The management was\r\nextremely terse over the telephone at breakfast-time, and took a lot of\r\nsoothing.\r\n\r\nThe next night I came home early, after a lonely dinner at a place\r\nwhich I'd chosen because there didn't seem any chance of meeting Motty\r\nthere. The sitting-room was quite dark, and I was just moving to switch\r\non the light, when there was a sort of explosion and something collared\r\nhold of my trouser-leg. Living with Motty had reduced me to such an\r\nextent that I was simply unable to cope with this thing. I jumped\r\nbackward with a loud yell of anguish, and tumbled out into the hall\r\njust as Jeeves came out of his den to see what the matter was.\r\n\r\n'Did you call, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves! There's something in there that grabs you by the leg!'\r\n\r\n'That would be Rollo, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'I would have warned you of his presence, but I did not hear you come\r\nin. His temper is a little uncertain at present, as he has not yet\r\nsettled down.'\r\n\r\n'Who the deuce is Rollo?'\r\n\r\n'His lordship's bull-terrier, sir. His lordship won him in a raffle,\r\nand tied him to the leg of the table. If you will allow me, sir, I will\r\ngo in and switch on the light.'\r\n\r\nThere really is nobody like Jeeves. He walked straight into the\r\nsitting-room, the biggest feat since Daniel and the lions' den, without\r\na quiver. What's more, his magnetism or whatever they call it was such\r\nthat the dashed animal, instead of pinning him by the leg, calmed down\r\nas if he had had a bromide, and rolled over on his back with all his\r\npaws in the air. If Jeeves had been his rich uncle he couldn't have\r\nbeen more chummy. Yet directly he caught sight of me again, he got all\r\nworked up and seemed to have only one idea in life--to start chewing me\r\nwhere he had left off.\r\n\r\n'Rollo is not used to you yet, sir,' said Jeeves, regarding the bally\r\nquadruped in an admiring sort of way. 'He is an excellent watch-dog.'\r\n\r\n'I don't want a watch-dog to keep me out of my rooms.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what am I to do?'\r\n\r\n'No doubt in time the animal will learn to discriminate, sir. He will\r\nlearn to distinguish your peculiar scent.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean--my peculiar scent? Correct the impression that I\r\nintend to hang about in the hall while life slips by, in the hope that\r\none of these days that dashed animal will decide that I smell all\r\nright.' I thought for a bit. 'Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going away--tomorrow morning by the first train. I shall go and\r\nstop with Mr Todd in the country.'\r\n\r\n'Do you wish me to accompany you, sir?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know when I shall be back. Forward my letters.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I was back within the week. Rocky Todd, the pal I\r\nwent to stay with, is a rummy sort of a chap who lives all alone in the\r\nwilds of Long Island, and likes it; but a little of that sort of thing\r\ngoes a long way with me. Dear old Rocky is one of the best, but after\r\na few days in his cottage in the woods, miles away from anywhere, New\r\nYork, even with Motty on the premises, began to look pretty good to me.\r\nThe days down on Long Island have forty-eight hours in them, you can't\r\nget to sleep at night because of the bellowing of the crickets; and\r\nyou have to walk two miles for a drink and six for an evening paper. I\r\nthanked Rocky for his kind hospitality, and caught the only train they\r\nhave down in those parts. It landed me in New York about dinner-time.\r\nI went straight to the old flat. Jeeves came out of his lair. I looked\r\nround cautiously for Rollo.\r\n\r\n'Where's that dog, Jeeves? Have you got him tied up?'\r\n\r\n'The animal is no longer here, sir. His lordship gave him to the\r\nporter, who sold him. His lordship took a prejudice against the animal\r\non account of being bitten by him in the calf of the leg.'\r\n\r\nI don't think I've ever been so bucked by a bit of news. I felt I had\r\nmisjudged Rollo. Evidently, when you got to know him better, he had a\r\nlot of good in him.\r\n\r\n'Fine!' I said. 'Is Lord Pershore in, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Do you expect him back to dinner?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Where is he?'\r\n\r\n'In prison, sir.'\r\n\r\n'In prison!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean--in prison?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nI lowered myself into a chair.\r\n\r\n'Why?' I said.\r\n\r\n'He assaulted a constable, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Lord Pershore assaulted a constable!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nI digested this.\r\n\r\n'But, Jeeves, I say! This is frightful!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'What will Lady Malvern say when she finds out?'\r\n\r\n'I do not fancy that her ladyship will find out, sir.'\r\n\r\n'But she'll come back and want to know where he is.'\r\n\r\n'I rather fancy, sir, that his lordship's bit of time will have run out\r\nby then.'\r\n\r\n'But supposing it hasn't?'\r\n\r\n'In that event, sir, it may be judicious to prevaricate a little.'\r\n\r\n'How?'\r\n\r\n'If I might make the suggestion, sir, I should inform her ladyship that\r\nhis lordship has left for a short visit to Boston.'\r\n\r\n'Why Boston?'\r\n\r\n'Very interesting and respectable centre, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, I believe you've hit it.'\r\n\r\n'I fancy so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Why, this is really the best thing that could have happened. If this\r\nhadn't turned up to prevent him, young Motty would have been in a\r\nsanatorium by the time Lady Malvern got back.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe more I looked at it in that way, the sounder this prison wheeze\r\nseemed to me. There was no doubt in the world that prison was just what\r\nthe doctor ordered for Motty. It was the only thing that could have\r\npulled him up. I was sorry for the poor blighter, but after all, I\r\nreflected, a fellow who had lived all his life with Lady Malvern, in a\r\nsmall village in the interior of Shropshire, wouldn't have much to kick\r\nat in a prison. Altogether, I began to feel absolutely braced again.\r\nLife became like what the poet Johnnie says--one grand, sweet song.\r\nThings went on so comfortably and peacefully for a couple of weeks that\r\nI give you my word that I'd almost forgotten such a person as Motty\r\nexisted. The only flaw in the scheme of things was that Jeeves was\r\nstill pained and distant. It wasn't anything he said, or did, mind you,\r\nbut there was a rummy something about him all the time. Once when I was\r\ntying the pink tie I caught sight of him in the looking-glass. There\r\nwas a kind of grieved look in his eye.\r\n\r\nAnd then Lady Malvern came back, a good bit ahead of schedule. I hadn't\r\nbeen expecting her for days. I'd forgotten how time had been slipping\r\nalong. She turned up one morning while I was still in bed sipping tea\r\nand thinking of this and that. Jeeves flowed in with the announcement\r\nthat he had just loosed her into the sitting-room. I draped a few\r\ngarments round me and went in.\r\n\r\nThere she was, sitting in the same arm-chair, looking as massive as\r\never. The only difference was that she didn't uncover the teeth as she\r\nhad done the first time.\r\n\r\n'Good morning,' I said. 'So you've got back, what?'\r\n\r\n'I have got back.'\r\n\r\nThere was something sort of bleak about her tone, rather as if she had\r\nswallowed an east wind. This I took to be due to the fact that she\r\nprobably hadn't breakfasted. It's only after a bit of breakfast that\r\nI'm able to regard the world with that sunny cheeriness which makes\r\na fellow the universal favourite. I'm never much of a lad till I've\r\nengulfed an egg or two and a beaker of coffee.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you haven't breakfasted?'\r\n\r\n'I have not yet breakfasted.'\r\n\r\n'Won't you have an egg or something? Or a sausage or something? Or\r\nsomething?'\r\n\r\n'No, thank you.'\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if she belonged to an anti-sausage society or a league for\r\nthe suppression of eggs. There was a bit of a silence.\r\n\r\n'I called on you last night,' she said, 'but you were out.'\r\n\r\n'Awfully sorry. Had a pleasant trip?'\r\n\r\n'Extremely, thank you.'\r\n\r\n'See everything? Niagara Falls, Yellowstone Park, and the jolly old\r\nGrand Canyon, and what-not?'\r\n\r\n'I saw a great deal.'\r\n\r\nThere was another slightly _frappé_ silence. Jeeves floated silently\r\ninto the dining-room and began to lay the breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n'I hope Wilmot was not in your way, Mr Wooster?'\r\n\r\nI had been wondering when she was going to mention Motty.\r\n\r\n'Rather not! Great pals. Hit it off splendidly.'\r\n\r\n'You were his constant companion, then?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely. We were always together. Saw all the sights, don't you\r\nknow. We'd take in the Museum of Art in the morning, and have a bit of\r\nlunch at some good vegetarian place, and then toddle along to a sacred\r\nconcert in the afternoon, and home to an early dinner. We usually\r\nplayed dominoes after dinner. And then the early bed and the refreshing\r\nsleep. We had a great time. I was awfully sorry when he went away to\r\nBoston.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! Wilmot is in Boston?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. I ought to have let you know, but of course we didn't know where\r\nyou were. You were dodging all over the place like a snipe--I mean,\r\ndon't you know, dodging all over the place, and we couldn't get at you.\r\nYes, Motty went off to Boston.'\r\n\r\n'You're sure he went to Boston?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, absolutely.' I called out to Jeeves, who was now messing about in\r\nthe next room with forks and so forth: 'Jeeves, Lord Pershore didn't\r\nchange his mind about going to Boston, did he?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I thought I was right. Yes, Motty went to Boston.'\r\n\r\n'Then how do you account, Mr Wooster, for the fact that when I went\r\nyesterday afternoon to Blackwell's Island prison, to secure material\r\nfor my book, I saw poor, dear Wilmot there, dressed in a striped suit,\r\nseated beside a pile of stones with a hammer in his hands?'\r\n\r\nI tried to think of something to say, but nothing came. A fellow has\r\nto be a lot broader about the forehead than I am to handle a jolt like\r\nthis. I strained the old bean till it creaked, but between the collar\r\nand the hair parting nothing stirred. I was dumb. Which was lucky,\r\nbecause I wouldn't have had a chance to get any persiflage out of my\r\nsystem. Lady Malvern collared the conversation. She had been bottling\r\nit up, and now it came out with a rush.\r\n\r\n'So this is how you have looked after my poor, dear boy, Mr Wooster!\r\nSo this is how you have abused my trust! I left him in your charge,\r\nthinking that I could rely on you to shield him from evil. He came to\r\nyou innocent, unversed in the ways of the world, confiding, unused to\r\nthe temptations of a large city, and you led him astray!'\r\n\r\nI hadn't any remarks to make. All I could think of was the picture\r\nof Aunt Agatha drinking all this in and reaching out to sharpen the\r\nhatchet against my return.\r\n\r\n'You deliberately--'\r\n\r\nFar away in the misty distance a soft voice spoke:\r\n\r\n'If I might explain, your ladyship.'\r\n\r\nJeeves had projected himself in from the dining-room and materialized\r\non the rug. Lady Malvern tried to freeze him with a look, but you can't\r\ndo that sort of thing to Jeeves. He is look-proof.\r\n\r\n'I fancy, your ladyship, that you may have misunderstood Mr Wooster,\r\nand that he may have given you the impression that he was in New York\r\nwhen his lordship was--removed. When Mr Wooster informed your ladyship\r\nthat his lordship had gone to Boston, he was relying on the version\r\nI had given him of his lordship's movements. Mr Wooster was away,\r\nvisiting a friend in the country, at the time, and knew nothing of the\r\nmatter till your ladyship informed him.'\r\n\r\nLady Malvern gave a kind of grunt. It didn't rattle Jeeves.\r\n\r\n'I feared Mr Wooster might be disturbed if he knew the truth, as he is\r\nso attached to his lordship and has taken such pains to look after him,\r\nso I took the liberty of telling him that his lordship had gone away\r\nfor a visit. It might have been hard for Mr Wooster to believe that\r\nhis lordship had gone to prison voluntarily and from the best motives,\r\nbut your ladyship, knowing him better, will readily understand.'\r\n\r\n'What!' Lady Malvern goggled at him. 'Did you say that Lord Pershore\r\nwent to prison voluntarily?'\r\n\r\n'If I might explain, your ladyship. I think that your ladyship's\r\nparting words made a deep impression on his lordship. I have frequently\r\nheard him speak to Mr Wooster of his desire to do something to follow\r\nyour ladyship's instructions and collect material for your ladyship's\r\nbook on America. Mr Wooster will bear me out when I say that his\r\nlordship was frequently extremely depressed at the thought that he was\r\ndoing so little to help.'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely, by Jove! Quite pipped about it!' I said.\r\n\r\n'The idea of making a personal examination into the prison system of\r\nthe country--from within--occurred to his lordship very suddenly one\r\nnight. He embraced it eagerly. There was no restraining him.'\r\n\r\nLady Malvern looked at Jeeves, then at me, then at Jeeves again. I\r\ncould see her struggling with the thing.\r\n\r\n'Surely, your ladyship,' said Jeeves, 'it is more reasonable to suppose\r\nthat a gentleman of his lordship's character went to prison of his\r\nown volition than that he committed some breach of the law which\r\nnecessitated his arrest?'\r\n\r\nLady Malvern blinked. Then she got up.\r\n\r\n'Mr Wooster,' she said, 'I apologize. I have done you an injustice. I\r\nshould have known Wilmot better. I should have had more faith in his\r\npure, fine spirit.'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely!' I said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Your breakfast is ready, sir,' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\nI sat down and dallied in a dazed sort of way with a poached egg.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'you are certainly a life-saver.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing would have convinced my Aunt Agatha, that I hadn't lured that\r\nblighter into riotous living.'\r\n\r\n'I fancy you are right, sir.'\r\n\r\nI champed my egg for a bit. I was most awfully moved, don't you know,\r\nby the way Jeeves had rallied round. Something seemed to tell me that\r\nthis was an occasion that called for rich rewards. For a moment I\r\nhesitated. Then I made up my mind.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'That pink tie.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Burn it.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Take a taxi and get me that White House Wonder hat, as worn by\r\nPresident Coolidge.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much, sir.'\r\n\r\nI felt most awfully braced. I felt as if the clouds had rolled away\r\nand all was as it used to be. I felt like one of those chappies in the\r\nnovels who calls off the fight with his wife in the last chapter and\r\ndecides to forget and forgive. I felt I wanted to do all sorts of other\r\nthings to show Jeeves that I appreciated him.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'it isn't enough. Is there anything else you would\r\nlike?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. If I may make the suggestion--fifty dollars.'\r\n\r\n'Fifty dollars?'\r\n\r\n'It will enable me to pay a debt of honour, sir. I owe it to his\r\nlordship.'\r\n\r\n'You owe Lord Pershore fifty dollars?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. I happened to meet him in the street the night his lordship\r\nwas arrested. I had been thinking a good deal about the most suitable\r\nmethod of inducing him to abandon his mode of living, sir. His lordship\r\nwas a little over-excited at the time, and I fancy that he mistook me\r\nfor a friend of his. At any rate, when I took the liberty of wagering\r\nhim fifty dollars that he would not punch a passing policeman in the\r\neye, he accepted the bet very cordially and won it.'\r\n\r\nI produced my pocket-book and counted out a hundred.\r\n\r\n'Take this, Jeeves,' I said; 'fifty isn't enough. Do you know, Jeeves,\r\nyou're--well, you absolutely stand alone!'\r\n\r\n'I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir,' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   4--Jeeves and the Hard-Boiled Egg\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes of a morning, as I've sat in bed sucking down the early cup\r\nof tea and watched Jeeves flitting about the room and putting out the\r\nraiment for the day, I've wondered what the deuce I should do if the\r\nfellow ever took it into his head to leave me. It's not so bad when\r\nI'm in New York, but in London the anxiety is frightful. There used\r\nto be all sorts of attempts on the part of low blighters to sneak him\r\naway from me. Young Reggie Foljambe to my certain knowledge offered him\r\ndouble what I was giving him, and Alistair Bingham-Reeves, who's got a\r\nvalet who had been known to press his trousers sideways, used to look\r\nat him, when he came to see me, with a kind of glittering, hungry eye\r\nwhich disturbed me deucedly. Bally pirates!\r\n\r\nThe thing, you see, is that Jeeves is so dashed competent. You can spot\r\nit even in the way he shoves studs into a shirt.\r\n\r\nI rely on him absolutely in every crisis, and he never lets me down.\r\nAnd, what's more, he can always be counted on to extend himself\r\non behalf of any pal of mine who happens to be to all appearances\r\nknee-deep in the bouillon. Take the rather rummy case, for instance, of\r\ndear old Bicky and his uncle, the hard-boiled egg.\r\n\r\nIt happened after I had been in America for a few months. I got back to\r\nthe flat latish one night, and when Jeeves brought me the final drink\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n'Mr Bickersteth called to see you this evening, sir, while you were\r\nout.'\r\n\r\n'Oh?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Twice, sir. He appeared a trifle agitated.'\r\n\r\n'What, pipped?'\r\n\r\n'He gave that impression, sir.'\r\n\r\nI sipped the whisky. I was sorry if Bicky was in trouble, but, as a\r\nmatter of fact, I was rather glad to have something I could discuss\r\nfreely with Jeeves just then, because things had been a bit strained\r\nbetween us for some time, and it had been rather difficult to hit on\r\nanything to talk about that wasn't apt to take a personal turn. You\r\nsee, I had decided--rightly or wrongly--to grow a moustache, and this\r\nhad cut Jeeves to the quick. He couldn't stick the thing at any price,\r\nand I had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapproval\r\ntill I was getting jolly well fed up with it. What I mean is, while\r\nthere's no doubt that in certain matters of dress Jeeves's judgement\r\nis absolutely sound and should be followed, it seemed to me that it\r\nwas getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well\r\nas my costume. No one can call me an unreasonable chappie, and many's\r\nthe time I've given in like a lamb when Jeeves has voted against one\r\nof my pet suits or ties; but when it comes to a valet's staking out a\r\nclaim on your upper lip you've simply got to have a bit of the good old\r\nbulldog pluck and defy the blighter.\r\n\r\n'He said that he would call again later, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Something must be up, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nI gave the moustache a thoughtful twirl. It seemed to hurt Jeeves a\r\ngood deal, so I chucked it.\r\n\r\n'I see by the paper, sir, that Mr Bickersteth's uncle is arriving on\r\nthe _Carmantic_.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'His Grace the Duke of Chiswick, sir.'\r\n\r\nThis was news to me, that Bicky's uncle was a duke. Rum, how little one\r\nknows about one's pals. I had met Bicky for the first time at a species\r\nof beano or jamboree down in Washington Square, not long after my\r\narrival in New York. I suppose I was a bit homesick at the time, and I\r\nrather took to Bicky when I found that he was an Englishman and had, in\r\nfact, been up at Oxford with me. Besides, he was a frightful chump, so\r\nwe naturally drifted together; and while we were taking a quiet snort\r\nin a corner that wasn't all cluttered up with artists and sculptors,\r\nhe furthermore endeared himself to me by a most extraordinarily gifted\r\nimitation of a bull-terrier chasing a cat up a tree. But, though we had\r\nsubsequently become extremely pally, all I really knew about him was\r\nthat he was generally hard up, and had an uncle who relieved the strain\r\na bit from time to time by sending him monthly remittances.\r\n\r\n'If the Duke of Chiswick is his uncle,' I said, 'why hasn't he a title?\r\nWhy isn't he Lord What-Not?'\r\n\r\n'Mr Bickersteth is the son of His Grace's late sister, sir, who married\r\nCaptain Rollo Bickersteth of the Coldstream Guards.'\r\n\r\nJeeves knows everything.\r\n\r\n'Is Mr Bickersteth's father dead too?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Leave any money?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\nI began to understand why poor old Bicky was always more or less on the\r\nrocks. To the casual and irreflective observer it may sound a pretty\r\ngood wheeze having a duke for an uncle, but the trouble about old\r\nChiswick was that, though an extremely wealthy old buster, owning half\r\nLondon and about five counties up north, he was notoriously the most\r\nprudent spender in England. He was what Americans call a hard-boiled\r\negg. If Bicky's people hadn't left him anything and he depended on what\r\nhe could prise out of the old duke, he was in a pretty bad way. Not\r\nthat that explained why he was hunting me like this, because he was a\r\nchap who never borrowed money. He said he wanted to keep his pals, so\r\nnever bit anyone's ear on principle.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the door-bell rang. Jeeves floated out to answer it.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Mr Wooster has just returned,' I heard him say. And Bicky\r\ncame beetling in, looking pretty sorry for himself.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, Bicky,' I said. 'Jeeves told me you had been trying to get me.\r\nWhat's the trouble, Bicky?'\r\n\r\n'I'm in a hole, Bertie. I want your advice.'\r\n\r\n'Say on, old lad.'\r\n\r\n'My uncle's turning up tomorrow, Bertie.'\r\n\r\n'So Jeeves told me.'\r\n\r\n'The Duke of Chiswick, you know.'\r\n\r\n'So Jeeves told me.'\r\n\r\nBicky seemed a bit surprised.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves seems to know everything.'\r\n\r\n'Rather rummily, that's exactly what I was thinking just now myself.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I wish,' said Bicky, gloomily, 'that he knew a way to get me out\r\nof the hole I'm in.'\r\n\r\n'Mr Bickersteth is in a hole, Jeeves,' I said, 'and wants you to rally\r\nround.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nBicky looked a bit doubtful.\r\n\r\n'Well, of course, you know, Bertie, this thing is by way of being a bit\r\nprivate and all that.'\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't worry about that, old top. I bet Jeeves knows all about it\r\nalready. Don't you, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?' said Bicky, rattled.\r\n\r\n'I am open to correction, sir, but is not your dilemma due to the fact\r\nthat you are at a loss to explain to His Grace why you are in New York\r\ninstead of in Colorado?'\r\n\r\nBicky rocked like a jelly in a high wind.\r\n\r\n'How the deuce do you know anything about it?'\r\n\r\n'I chanced to meet His Grace's butler before we left England. He\r\ninformed me that he happened to overhear His Grace speaking to you on\r\nthe matter, sir, as he passed the library door.'\r\n\r\nBicky gave a hollow sort of laugh.\r\n\r\n'Well, as everybody seems to know all about it, there's no need to try\r\nto keep it dark. The old boy turfed me out, Bertie, because he said\r\nI was a brainless nincompoop. The idea was that he would give me a\r\nremittance on condition that I dashed out to some blighted locality of\r\nthe name of Colorado and learned farming or ranching, or whatever they\r\ncall it, at some bally ranch or farm, or whatever it's called. I didn't\r\nfancy the idea a bit. I should have had to ride horses and pursue cows,\r\nand so forth. At the same time, don't you know, I had to have that\r\nremittance.'\r\n\r\n'I get you absolutely, old thing.'\r\n\r\n'Well, when I got to New York it looked a decent sort of place to me,\r\nso I thought it would be a pretty sound notion to stop here. So I\r\ncabled to my uncle telling him that I had dropped into a good business\r\nwheeze in the city and wanted to chuck the ranch idea. He wrote back\r\nthat it was all right, and here I've been ever since. He thinks I'm\r\ndoing well at something or other over here. I never dreamed, don't you\r\nknow, that he would ever come out here. What on earth am I to do?'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'what on earth is Mr Bickersteth to do?'\r\n\r\n'You see,' said Bicky, 'I had a wireless from him to say that he was\r\ncoming to stay with me--to save hotel bills, I suppose. I've always\r\ngiven him the impression that I was living in pretty good style. I\r\ncan't have him to stay at my boarding-house.'\r\n\r\n'Thought of anything, Jeeves?' I said.\r\n\r\n'To what extent, sir, if the question is not a delicate one, are you\r\nprepared to assist Mr Bickersteth?'\r\n\r\n'I'll do anything I can for you, of course, Bicky, old man.'\r\n\r\n'Then, if I might make the suggestion, sir, you might lend Mr\r\nBickersteth--'\r\n\r\n'No, by Jove!' said Bicky firmly. 'I never have touched you, Bertie,\r\nand I'm not going to start now. I may be a chump, but it's my boast\r\nthat I don't owe a penny to a single soul--not counting tradesmen, of\r\ncourse.'\r\n\r\n'I was about to suggest, sir, that you might lend Mr Bickersteth this\r\nflat. Mr Bickersteth could give His Grace the impression that he was\r\nthe owner of it. With your permission I could convey the notion that\r\nI was in Mr Bickersteth's employment and not in yours. You would be\r\nresiding here temporarily as Mr Bickersteth's guest. His Grace would\r\noccupy the second spare bedroom. I fancy that you would find this\r\nanswer satisfactory, sir.'\r\n\r\nBicky had stopped rocking himself and was staring at Jeeves in an awed\r\nsort of way.\r\n\r\n'I would advocate the dispatching of a wireless message to His Grace\r\non board the vessel, notifying him of the change of address. Mr\r\nBickersteth could meet His Grace at the dock and proceed directly here.\r\nWill that meet the situation, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\nBicky followed him with his eye till the door closed.\r\n\r\n'How does he do it, Bertie?' he said. 'I'll tell you what I think it\r\nis. I believe it's something to do with the shape of his head. Have you\r\never noticed his head, Bertie, old man? It sort of sticks out at the\r\nback!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hopped out of bed pretty early next morning, so as to be among those\r\npresent when the old boy should arrive. I knew from experience that\r\nthese ocean liners fetch up at the dock at a deucedly ungodly hour.\r\nIt wasn't much after nine by the time I'd dressed and had my morning\r\ntea and was leaning out of the window, watching the street for Bicky\r\nand his uncle. It was one of those jolly, peaceful mornings that make\r\na chappie wish he'd got a soul or something, and I was just brooding\r\non life in general when I became aware of the dickens of a spat in\r\nprogress down below. A taxi had driven up, and an old boy in a top hat\r\nhad got out and was kicking up a frightful row about the fare. As far\r\nas I could make out, he was trying to get the cabby to switch from New\r\nYork to London prices, and the cabby had apparently never heard of\r\nLondon before, and didn't seem to think a lot of it now. The old boy\r\nsaid that in London the trip would have set him back a shilling; and\r\nthe cabby said he should worry. I called to Jeeves.\r\n\r\n'The duke has arrived, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'That'll be him at the door now.'\r\n\r\nJeeves made a long arm and opened the front door, and the old boy\r\ncrawled in.\r\n\r\n'How do you do, sir?' I said, bustling up and being the ray of\r\nsunshine. 'Your nephew went down to the dock to meet you, but you\r\nmust have missed him. My name's Wooster, don't you know. Great pal of\r\nBicky's, and all that sort of thing. I'm staying with him, you know.\r\nWould you like a cup of tea? Jeeves, bring a cup of tea.'\r\n\r\nOld Chiswick had sunk into an arm-chair and was looking about the room.\r\n\r\n'Does this luxurious flat belong to my nephew Francis?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely.'\r\n\r\n'It must be terribly expensive.'\r\n\r\n'Pretty well, of course. Everything costs a lot over here, you know.'\r\n\r\nHe moaned. Jeeves filtered in with the tea. Old Chiswick took a stab at\r\nit to restore his tissues, and nodded.\r\n\r\n'A terrible country, Mr Wooster! A terrible country. Nearly eight\r\nshillings for a short cab-drive. Iniquitous!' He took another look\r\nround the room. It seemed to fascinate him. 'Have you any idea how\r\nmuch my nephew pays for this flat, Mr Wooster?'\r\n\r\n'About two hundred dollars a month, I believe.'\r\n\r\n'What! Forty pounds a month!'\r\n\r\nI began to see that, unless I made the thing a bit more plausible,\r\nthe scheme might turn out a frost. I could guess what the old boy was\r\nthinking. He was trying to square all this prosperity with what he knew\r\nof poor old Bicky. And one had to admit that it took a lot of squaring,\r\nfor dear old Bicky, though a stout fellow and absolutely unrivalled as\r\nan imitator of bull-terriers and cats, was in many ways one of the most\r\npronounced fatheads that ever pulled on a suit of gents' underwear.\r\n\r\n'I suppose it seems rummy to you,' I said, 'but the fact is New York\r\noften bucks fellows up and makes them show a flash of speed that you\r\nwouldn't have imagined them capable of. It sort of develops them.\r\nSomething in the air, don't you know. I imagine that Bicky in the\r\npast, when you knew him, may have been something of a chump, but it's\r\nquite different now. Devilish efficient sort of bird, and looked on in\r\ncommercial circles as quite the nib!'\r\n\r\n'I am amazed! What is the nature of my nephew's business, Mr Wooster?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, just business, don't you know. The same sort of thing Rockefeller\r\nand all these coves do, you know.' I slid for the door. 'Awfully sorry\r\nto leave you, but I've got to meet some of the lads elsewhere.'\r\n\r\nComing out of the lift I met Bicky bustling in from the street.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, Bertie. I missed him. Has he turned up?'\r\n\r\n'He's upstairs now, having some tea.'\r\n\r\n'What does he think of it all?'\r\n\r\n'He's absolutely rattled.'\r\n\r\n'Ripping! I'll be toddling up, then. Toodle-oo, Bertie, old man. See\r\nyou later.'\r\n\r\n'Pip-pip, Bicky, dear boy.'\r\n\r\nHe trotted off, full of merriment and good cheer, and I went off to the\r\nclub to sit in the window and watch the traffic coming up one way and\r\ngoing down the other.\r\n\r\nIt was latish in the evening when I looked in at the flat to dress for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n'Where's everybody, Jeeves?' I said, finding no little feet pattering\r\nabout the place. 'Gone out?'\r\n\r\n'His Grace desired to see some of the sights of the city, sir. Mr\r\nBickersteth is acting as his escort. I fancy their immediate objective\r\nwas Grant's Tomb.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose Mr Bickersteth is a bit bucked at the way things are\r\ngoing--what?'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'I say, I take it that Mr Bickersteth is tolerably full of beans.'\r\n\r\n'Not altogether, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What's his trouble now?'\r\n\r\n'The scheme which I took the liberty of suggesting to Mr Bickersteth\r\nand yourself has, unfortunately, not answered entirely satisfactorily,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\n'Surely the duke believes that Mr Bickersteth is doing well in\r\nbusiness, and all that sort of thing?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly, sir. With the result that he has decided to cancel Mr\r\nBickersteth's monthly allowance, on the ground that, as Mr Bickersteth\r\nis doing so well on his own account, he no longer requires pecuniary\r\nassistance.'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott, Jeeves! This is awful!'\r\n\r\n'Somewhat disturbing, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I never expected anything like this!'\r\n\r\n'I confess I scarcely anticipated the contingency myself, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?'\r\n\r\n'Mr Bickersteth appeared somewhat taken aback, sir.'\r\n\r\nMy heart bled for Bicky.\r\n\r\n'We must do something, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Can you think of anything?'\r\n\r\n'Not at the moment, sir.'\r\n\r\n'There must be something we can do.'\r\n\r\n'It was a maxim of one of my former employers, sir--as I believe I\r\nmentioned to you once before--the present Lord Bridgworth, that there\r\nis always a way. No doubt we shall be able to discover some solution of\r\nMr Bickersteth's difficulty, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, have a stab at it, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'I will spare no pains, sir.'\r\n\r\nI went and dressed sadly. It will show you pretty well how pipped I was\r\nwhen I tell you that I as near as a toucher put on a white tie with a\r\ndinner-jacket. I sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time\r\nthan because I wanted it. It seemed brutal to be wading into the bill\r\nof fare with poor old Bicky headed for the bread-line.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back old Chiswick had gone to bed, but Bicky was there,\r\nhunched up in an arm-chair, brooding pretty tensely, with a cigarette\r\nhanging out of the corner of his mouth and a more or less glassy stare\r\nin his eyes.\r\n\r\n'This is a bit thick, old thing--what!' I said.\r\n\r\nHe picked up his glass and drained it feverishly, overlooking the fact\r\nthat it hadn't anything in it.\r\n\r\n'I'm done, Bertie!' he said.\r\n\r\nHe had another go at the glass. It didn't seem to do him any good.\r\n\r\n'If only this had happened a week later, Bertie! My next month's money\r\nwas due to roll in on Saturday. I could have worked a wheeze I've been\r\nreading about in the magazine advertisements. It seems that you can\r\nmake a dashed amount of money if you can only collect a few dollars and\r\nstart a chicken farm. Jolly life, too, keeping hens!' He had begun to\r\nget quite worked up at the thought of it, but he slopped back in his\r\nchair at this juncture with a good deal of gloom. 'But, of course, it's\r\nno good,' he said, 'because I haven't the cash.'\r\n\r\n'You've only to say the word, you know, Bicky, old top.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks awfully, Bertie, but I'm not going to sponge on you.'\r\n\r\nThat's always the way in this world. The chappies you'd like to lend\r\nmoney to won't let you, whereas the chappies you don't want to lend\r\nit to will do everything except actually stand you on your head and\r\nlift the specie out of your pockets. As a lad who has always rolled\r\ntolerably freely in the right stuff, I've had lots of experience of\r\nthe second class. Many's the time, back in London, I've hurried along\r\nPiccadilly and felt the hot breath of the toucher on the back of my\r\nneck and heard his sharp, excited yapping as he closed in on me. I've\r\nsimply spent my life scattering largesse to blighters I didn't care a\r\nhang for; yet here was I now, dripping doubloons and pieces of eight\r\nand longing to hand them over, and Bicky, poor fish, absolutely on his\r\nuppers, not taking any at any price.\r\n\r\n'Well, there's only one hope then.'\r\n\r\n'What's that?'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\nThere was Jeeves, standing behind me, full of zeal. In this matter of\r\nshimmering into rooms the man is rummy to a degree. You're sitting in\r\nthe old arm-chair, thinking of this and that, and then suddenly you\r\nlook up, and there he is. He moves from point to point with as little\r\nuproar as a jelly-fish. The thing startled poor old Bicky considerably.\r\nHe rose from his seat like a rocketing pheasant. I'm used to Jeeves\r\nnow, but often in the days when he first came to me I've bitten my\r\ntongue freely on finding him unexpectedly in my midst.\r\n\r\n'Did you call, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, there you are, Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Precisely, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Any ideas, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Why, yes, sir. Since we had our recent conversation I fancy I have\r\nfound what may prove a solution. I do not wish to appear to be taking\r\na liberty, sir, but I think that we have overlooked His Grace's\r\npotentialities as a source of revenue.'\r\n\r\nBicky laughed what I have sometimes seen described as a hollow, mocking\r\nlaugh, a sort of bitter cackle from the back of the throat, rather like\r\na gargle.\r\n\r\n'I do not allude, sir,' explained Jeeves, 'to the possibility of\r\ninducing His Grace to part with money. I am taking the liberty of\r\nregarding His Grace in the light of an at present--if I may say\r\nso--useless property, which is capable of being developed.'\r\n\r\nBicky looked at me in a helpless kind of way. I'm bound to say I didn't\r\nget it myself.\r\n\r\n'Couldn't you make it a bit easier, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'In a nutshell, sir, what I mean is this: His Grace is, in a sense, a\r\nprominent personage. The inhabitants of this country, as no doubt you\r\nare aware, sir, are peculiarly addicted to shaking hands with prominent\r\npersonages. It occurred to me that Mr Bickersteth or yourself might\r\nknow of persons who would be willing to pay a small fee--let us say\r\ntwo dollars or three--for the privilege of an introduction, including\r\nhandshake, to His Grace.'\r\n\r\nBicky didn't seem to think much of it.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to say that anyone would be mug enough to part with solid\r\ncash just to shake hands with my uncle?'\r\n\r\n'I have an aunt, sir, who paid five shillings to a young fellow for\r\nbringing a moving-picture actor to tea at her house one Sunday. It gave\r\nher social standing among the neighbours.'\r\n\r\nBicky wavered.\r\n\r\n'If you think it could be done--'\r\n\r\n'I feel convinced of it, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What do you think, Bertie?'\r\n\r\n'I'm for it, old boy, absolutely. A very brainy wheeze.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir. Will there be anything further? Good night, sir.'\r\n\r\nAnd he flitted out, leaving us to discuss details.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUntil we started this business of floating old Chiswick as a\r\nmoney-making proposition I had never realized what a perfectly foul\r\ntime those Stock Exchange fellows must have when the public isn't\r\nbiting freely. Nowadays I read that bit they put in the financial\r\nreports about 'The market opened quietly' with a sympathetic eye, for,\r\nby Jove, it certainly opened quietly for us. You'd hardly believe how\r\ndifficult it was to interest the public and make them take a flutter on\r\nthe old boy. By the end of a week the only name we had on our list was\r\na delicatessen-store keeper down in Bicky's part of the town, and as he\r\nwanted us to take it out in sliced ham instead of cash that didn't help\r\nmuch. There was a gleam of light when the brother of Bicky's pawnbroker\r\noffered ten dollars, money down, for an introduction to old Chiswick,\r\nbut the deal fell through, owing to its turning out that the chap was\r\nan anarchist and intended to kick the old boy instead of shaking hands\r\nwith him. At that, it took me the deuce of a time to persuade Bicky not\r\nto grab the cash and let things take their course. He seemed to regard\r\nthe pawnbroker's brother rather as a sportsman and benefactor of his\r\nspecies than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing, I'm inclined to think, would have been off if it\r\nhadn't been for Jeeves. There is no doubt that Jeeves is in a class of\r\nhis own. In the matter of brain and resource I don't think I have ever\r\nmet a chappie so supremely like mother made. He trickled into my room\r\none morning with the good old cup of tea, and intimated that there was\r\nsomething doing.\r\n\r\n'Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of His Grace, sir?'\r\n\r\n'It's all off. We've decided to chuck it.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'It won't work. We can't get anybody to come.'\r\n\r\n'I fancy I can arrange that aspect of the matter, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to say you've managed to get anybody?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Eighty-seven gentlemen from Birdsburg, sir.' I sat up in bed\r\nand spilt the tea.\r\n\r\n'Birdsburg?'\r\n\r\n'Birdsburg, Missouri, sir.'\r\n\r\n'How did you get them?'\r\n\r\n'I happened last night, sir, as you had intimated that you would be\r\nabsent from home, to attend a theatrical performance, and entered\r\ninto conversation between the acts with the occupant of the adjoining\r\nseat. I had observed that he was wearing a somewhat ornate decoration\r\nin his buttonhole, sir--a large blue button with the words \"Boost\r\nfor Birdsburg\" upon it in red letters, scarcely a judicious addition\r\nto a gentleman's evening costume. To my surprise I noticed that the\r\nauditorium was full of persons similarly decorated. I ventured to\r\ninquire the explanation, and was informed that these gentlemen, forming\r\na party of eighty-seven, are a convention from a town of the name\r\nof Birdsburg in the State of Missouri. Their visit, I gathered, was\r\npurely of a social and pleasurable nature, and my informant spoke at\r\nsome length of the entertainments arranged for their stay in the city.\r\nIt was when he related with a considerable amount of satisfaction and\r\npride that a deputation of their number had been introduced to and had\r\nshaken hands with a well-known prize-fighter that it occurred to me\r\nto broach the subject of His Grace. To make a long story short, sir,\r\nI have arranged, subject to your approval, that the entire convention\r\nshall be presented to His Grace tomorrow afternoon.'\r\n\r\nI was amazed.\r\n\r\n'Eighty-seven, Jeeves! At how much a head?'\r\n\r\n'I was obliged to agree to a reduction for quantity, sir. The terms\r\nfinally arrived at were one hundred and fifty dollars for the party.'\r\n\r\nI thought a bit.\r\n\r\n'Payable in advance?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir. I endeavoured to obtain payment in advance, but was not\r\nsuccessful.'\r\n\r\n'Well, anyway, when we get it I'll make it up to five hundred. Bicky'll\r\nnever know. Do you suppose Mr Bickersteth would suspect anything,\r\nJeeves, if I made it up to five hundred?'\r\n\r\n'I fancy not, sir. Mr Bickersteth is an agreeable gentleman, but not\r\nbright.'\r\n\r\n'All right, then. After breakfast run down to the bank and get me some\r\nmoney.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You know, you're a bit of a marvel, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Right-ho!'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nWhen I took dear old Bicky aside in the course of the morning and\r\ntold him what had happened he nearly broke down. He tottered into the\r\nsitting-room and buttonholed old Chiswick, who was reading the comic\r\nsection of the morning paper with a kind of grim resolution.\r\n\r\n'Uncle,' he said, 'are you doing anything special tomorrow afternoon?\r\nI mean to say, I've asked a few of my pals in to meet you, don't you\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\nThe old boy cocked a speculative eye at him.\r\n\r\n'There will be no reporters among them?'\r\n\r\n'Reporters? Rather not. Why?'\r\n\r\n'I refuse to be badgered by reporters. There were a number of adhesive\r\nyoung men who endeavoured to elicit from me my views on America while\r\nthe boat was approaching the dock. I will not be subjected to this\r\npersecution again.'\r\n\r\n'That'll be absolutely all right, uncle. There won't be a newspaper man\r\nin the place.'\r\n\r\n'In that case I shall be glad to make the acquaintance of your\r\nfriends.'\r\n\r\n'You'll shake hands with them, and so forth?'\r\n\r\n'I shall naturally order my behaviour according to the accepted rules\r\nof civilized intercourse.'\r\n\r\nBicky thanked him heartily and came off to lunch with me at the club,\r\nwhere he babbled freely of hens, incubators, and other rotten things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter mature consideration we had decided to unleash the Birdsburg\r\ncontingent on the old boy ten at a time. Jeeves brought his theatre\r\npal round to see us, and we arranged the whole thing with him. A very\r\ndecent chappie, but rather inclined to collar the conversation and\r\nturn it in the direction of his home-town's new water-supply system.\r\nWe settled that, as an hour was about all he would be likely to stand,\r\neach gang should consider itself entitled to seven minutes of the\r\nduke's society by Jeeves's stop-watch, and that when their time was up\r\nJeeves should slide into the room and cough meaningly. Then we parted\r\nwith what I believe are called mutual expressions of goodwill, the\r\nBirdsburg chappie extending a cordial invitation to us all to pop out\r\nsome day and take a look at the new water-supply system, for which we\r\nthanked him.\r\n\r\nNext day the deputation rolled in. The first shift consisted of the\r\ncove we had met and nine others almost exactly like him in every\r\nrespect. They all looked deuced keen and business-like, as if from\r\nyouth up they had been working in the office and catching the boss's\r\neye and what-not. They shook hands with the old boy with a good deal\r\nof apparent satisfaction--all except one chappie, who seemed to be\r\nbrooding about something--and then they stood off and became chatty.\r\n\r\n'What message have you for Birdsburg, duke?' asked our pal.\r\n\r\nThe old boy seemed a bit rattled.\r\n\r\n'I have never been to Birdsburg.'\r\n\r\nThe chappie seemed pained.\r\n\r\n'You should pay it a visit,' he said. 'The most rapidly growing city in\r\nthe country. Boost for Birdsburg!'\r\n\r\n'Boost for Birdsburg!' said the other chappies reverently.\r\n\r\nThe chappie who had been brooding suddenly gave tongue.\r\n\r\n'Say!'\r\n\r\nHe was a stout sort of well-fed cove with one of those determined chins\r\nand a cold eye.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage looked at him.\r\n\r\n'As a matter of business,' said the chappie--'mind you, I'm not\r\nquestioning anybody's good faith, but, as a matter of strict\r\nbusiness--I think this gentleman here ought to put himself on record\r\nbefore witnesses as stating that he really is a duke.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean, sir?' cried the old boy, getting purple.\r\n\r\n'No offence, simply business. I'm not saying anything, mind you, but\r\nthere's one thing that seems kind of funny to me. This gentleman here\r\nsays his name's Mr Bickersteth, as I understand it. Well, if you're the\r\nDuke of Chiswick, why isn't he Lord Percy Something? I've read English\r\nnovels, and I know all about it.'\r\n\r\n'This is monstrous!'\r\n\r\n'Now don't get hot under the collar. I'm only asking. I've a right to\r\nknow. You're going to take our money, so it's only fair that we should\r\nsee that we get our money's worth.'\r\n\r\nThe water-supply cove chipped in:\r\n\r\n'You're quite right, Simms. I overlooked that when making the\r\nagreement. You see, gentlemen, as business men we've a right to\r\nreasonable guarantees of good faith. We are paying Mr Bickersteth here\r\na hundred and fifty dollars for this reception, and we naturally want\r\nto know--'\r\n\r\nOld Chiswick gave Bicky a searching look; then he turned to the\r\nwater-supply chappie. He was frightfully calm.\r\n\r\n'I can assure you that I know nothing of this,' he said quite politely.\r\n'I should be grateful if you would explain.'\r\n\r\n'Well, we arranged with Mr Bickersteth that eighty-seven citizens\r\nof Birdsburg should have the privilege of meeting and shaking hands\r\nwith you for a financial consideration mutually arranged, and what my\r\nfriend Simms here means--and I'm with him--is that we have only Mr\r\nBickersteth's word for it--and he is a stranger to us--that you are the\r\nDuke of Chiswick at all.'\r\n\r\nOld Chiswick gulped.\r\n\r\n'Allow me to assure you, sir,' he said in a rummy kind of voice, 'that\r\nI am the Duke of Chiswick.'\r\n\r\n'Then that's all right,' said the chappie heartily. 'That was all we\r\nwanted to know. Let the thing go on.'\r\n\r\n'I am sorry to say,' said old Chiswick, 'that it cannot go on. I am\r\nfeeling a little tired. I fear I must ask to be excused.'\r\n\r\n'But there are seventy-seven of the boys waiting round the corner at\r\nthis moment, duke, to be introduced to you.'\r\n\r\n'I fear I must disappoint them.'\r\n\r\n'But in that case the deal would have to be off.'\r\n\r\n'That is a matter for you and my nephew to discuss.'\r\n\r\nThe chappie seemed troubled.\r\n\r\n'You really won't meet the rest of them?'\r\n\r\n'No!'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, I guess we'll be going.'\r\n\r\nThey went out, and there was a pretty solid silence. Then old Chiswick\r\nturned to Bicky:\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\nBicky didn't seem to have anything to say.\r\n\r\n'Was it true what that man said?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, uncle.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean by playing this trick?'\r\n\r\nBicky seemed pretty well knocked out, so I put in a word: 'I think\r\nyou'd better explain the whole thing, Bicky, old top.'\r\n\r\nBicky's adam's apple jumped about a bit; then he started.\r\n\r\n'You see, you had cut off my allowance, uncle, and I wanted a bit of\r\nmoney to start a chicken farm. I mean to say it's an absolute cert if\r\nyou once get a bit of capital. You buy a hen, and it lays an egg every\r\nday of the week, and you sell the egg, say, seven for twenty-five\r\ncents. Keep of hen costs nothing. Profit practically--'\r\n\r\n'What is all this nonsense about hens? You led me to suppose you were a\r\nsubstantial business man.'\r\n\r\n'Old Bicky rather exaggerated, sir,' I said, helping the chappie\r\nout. 'The fact is, the poor old lad is absolutely dependent on that\r\nremittance of yours, and when you cut it off, don't you know, he was\r\npretty solidly in the soup, and had to think of some way of closing\r\nin on a bit of the ready pretty quick. That's why we thought of this\r\nhand-shaking scheme.'\r\n\r\nOld Chiswick foamed at the mouth.\r\n\r\n'So you have lied to me! You have deliberately deceived me as to your\r\nfinancial status!'\r\n\r\n'Poor old Bicky didn't want to go to that ranch,' I explained. 'He\r\ndoesn't like cows and horses, but he rather thinks he would be hot\r\nstuff among the hens. All he wants is a bit of capital. Don't you think\r\nit would be rather a wheeze if you were to--'\r\n\r\n'After what has happened? After this--this deceit and foolery? Not a\r\npenny!'\r\n\r\n'But--'\r\n\r\n'Not a penny!'\r\n\r\nThere was a respectful cough in the background.\r\n\r\n'If I might make a suggestion, sir?'\r\n\r\nJeeves was standing on the horizon, looking devilish brainy.\r\n\r\n'Go ahead, Jeeves!' I said.\r\n\r\n'I would merely suggest, sir, that if Mr Bickersteth is in need of\r\na little ready money, and is at a loss to obtain it elsewhere he\r\nmight secure the sum he requires by describing the occurrences of\r\nthis afternoon for the Sunday issue of one of the more spirited and\r\nenterprising newspapers.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' I said.\r\n\r\n'By George!' said Bicky.\r\n\r\n'Great heavens!' said old Chiswick.\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir,' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\nBicky turned to old Chiswick with a gleaming eye.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves is right! I'll do it! The _Chronicle_ would jump at it. They\r\neat that sort of stuff.'\r\n\r\nOld Chiswick gave a kind of moaning howl.\r\n\r\n'I absolutely forbid you, Francis, to do this thing!'\r\n\r\n'That's all very well,' said Bicky, wonderfully braced, 'but if I can't\r\nget the money any other way--'\r\n\r\n'Wait! Er--wait, my boy! You are so impetuous! We might arrange\r\nsomething.'\r\n\r\n'I won't go to that bally ranch.'\r\n\r\n'No, no! No, no, my boy! I would not suggest it. I would not for a\r\nmoment suggest it. I--I think--' He seemed to have a bit of a struggle\r\nwith himself. 'I--I think that, on the whole it would be best if you\r\nreturned with me to England. I--I might--in fact, I think I see my\r\nway to doing--to--I might be able to utilize your services in some\r\nsecretarial position.'\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't mind that.'\r\n\r\n'I should not be able to offer you a salary, but, as you know, in\r\nEnglish political life the unpaid secretary is a recognized figure--'\r\n\r\n'The only figure I'll recognize,' said Bicky firmly, 'is five hundred\r\nquid a year, paid quarterly.'\r\n\r\n'My dear boy!'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely!'\r\n\r\n'But your recompense, my dear Francis, would consist in the unrivalled\r\nopportunities you would have, as my secretary, to gain experience, to\r\naccustom yourself to the intricacies of political life, to--in fact,\r\nyou would be in an exceedingly advantageous position.'\r\n\r\n'Five hundred a year!' said Bicky, rolling it round his tongue. 'Why,\r\nthat would be nothing to what I could make if I started a chicken farm.\r\nIt stands to reason. Suppose you have a dozen hens. Each of the hens\r\nhas a dozen chickens. After a bit the chickens grow up and have a dozen\r\nchickens each themselves, and then they all start laying eggs! There's\r\na fortune in it. You can get anything you like for eggs in America.\r\nFellows keep them on ice for years and years, and don't sell them\r\ntill they fetch about a dollar a whirl. You don't think I'm going to\r\nchuck a future like this for anything under five hundred o' goblins a\r\nyear--what?'\r\n\r\nA look of anguish passed over old Chiswick's face, then he seemed to be\r\nresigned to it. 'Very well, my boy,' he said.\r\n\r\n'What ho!' said Bicky. 'All right, then.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said. Bicky had taken the old boy off to dinner to\r\ncelebrate, and we were alone. 'Jeeves, this has been one of your best\r\nefforts.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'It beats me how you do it.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'The only trouble is you haven't got much out of it yourself.'\r\n\r\n'I fancy Mr Bickersteth intends--I judge from his remarks--to signify\r\nhis appreciation of anything I have been fortunate enough to do to\r\nassist him, at some later date when he is in a more favourable position\r\nto do so.'\r\n\r\n'It isn't enough, Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\nIt was a wrench, but I felt it was the only possible thing to be done.\r\n\r\n'Bring my shaving things.'\r\n\r\nA gleam of hope shone in the man's eye, mixed with doubt.\r\n\r\n'You mean, sir?'\r\n\r\n'And shave off my moustache.'\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence. I could see the fellow was deeply moved.\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much indeed, sir,' he said, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     5--The Aunt and the Sluggard\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that it's all over, I may as well admit that there was a time\r\nduring the affair of Rockmetteller Todd when I thought that Jeeves was\r\ngoing to let me down. Silly of me, of course, knowing him as I do, but\r\nthat is what I thought. It seemed to me that the man had the appearance\r\nof being baffled.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Todd business broke loose early one morning in spring. I\r\nwas in bed, restoring the physique with my usual nine hours of the\r\ndreamless, when the door flew open and somebody prodded me in the lower\r\nribs and began to shake the bedclothes in an unpleasant manner. And\r\nafter blinking a bit and generally pulling myself together, I located\r\nRocky, and my first impression was that it must be some horrid dream.\r\n\r\nRocky, you see, lived down on Long Island somewhere, miles away from\r\nNew York; and not only that, but he had told me himself more than\r\nonce that he never got up before twelve, and seldom earlier than one.\r\nConstitutionally the laziest young devil in America, he had hit on a\r\nwalk in life which enabled him to go the limit in that direction. He\r\nwas a poet. At least, he wrote poems when he did anything; but most of\r\nhis time, as far as I could make out, he spent in a sort of trance.\r\nHe told me once that he could sit on a fence, watching a worm and\r\nwondering what on earth it was up to for hours at a stretch.\r\n\r\nHe had his scheme of life worked out to a fine point. About once a\r\nmonth he would take three days writing a few poems; the other three\r\nhundred and twenty-nine days of the year he rested. I didn't know there\r\nwas enough money in poetry to support a chappie, even in the way in\r\nwhich Rocky lived; but it seems that, if you stick to exhortations to\r\nyoung men to lead the strenuous life and don't shove in any rhymes,\r\nAmerican editors fight for the stuff. Rocky showed me one of his things\r\nonce. It began:\r\n\r\n    Be!\r\n    Be!\r\n      The past is dead,\r\n      Tomorrow is not born.\r\n      Be today!\r\n    Today!\r\n      Be with every nerve,\r\n      With every fibre,\r\n      With every drop of your red blood!\r\n    Be!\r\n    Be!\r\n\r\nThere were three more verses, and the thing was printed opposite the\r\nfrontispiece of a magazine with a sort of scroll round it, and a\r\npicture in the middle of a fairly nude chappie with bulging muscles\r\ngiving the rising sun the glad eye. Rocky said they gave him a hundred\r\ndollars for it, and he stayed in bed till four in the afternoon for\r\nover a month.\r\n\r\nAs regarded the future he was pretty solid, owing to the fact that he\r\nhad a moneyed aunt tucked away somewhere in Illinois. It's a curious\r\nthing how many of my pals seem to have aunts and uncles who are their\r\nmain source of supply. There is Bicky for one, with his uncle the Duke\r\nof Chiswick; Corky, who, until things went wrong, looked to Alexander\r\nWorple, the bird specialist, for sustenance. And I shall be telling\r\nyou a story shortly of a dear old friend of mine, Oliver Sipperley,\r\nwho had an aunt in Yorkshire. These things cannot be mere coincidence.\r\nThey must be meant. What I'm driving at is that Providence seems to\r\nlook after the chumps of this world; and, personally, I'm all for it. I\r\nsuppose the fact is that, having been snootered from infancy upwards by\r\nmy own aunts, I like to see that it is possible for these relatives to\r\nhave a better and a softer side.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is more or less of a side-track. Coming back to Rocky,\r\nwhat I was saying was that he had this aunt in Illinois; and, as he had\r\nbeen named Rockmetteller after her (which in itself, you might say,\r\nentitled him to substantial compensation) and was her only nephew, his\r\nposition looked pretty sound. He told me that when he did come into the\r\nmoney he meant to do no work at all, except perhaps an occasional poem\r\nrecommending the young man with life opening out before him with all\r\nits splendid possibilities to light a pipe and shove his feet up on the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the man who was prodding me in the ribs in the grey dawn!\r\n\r\n'Read this, Bertie!' babbled old Rocky.\r\n\r\nI could just see that he was waving a letter or something equally foul\r\nin my face. 'Wake up and read this!'\r\n\r\nI can't read before I've had my morning tea and a cigarette. I groped\r\nfor the bell.\r\n\r\nJeeves came in, looking as fresh as a dewy violet. It's a mystery to me\r\nhow he does it.\r\n\r\n'Tea, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nI found that Rocky was surging round with his beastly letter again.\r\n\r\n'What is it?' I said. 'What on earth's the matter?'\r\n\r\n'Read it!'\r\n\r\n'I can't. I haven't had my tea.'\r\n\r\n'Well, listen then.'\r\n\r\n'Who's it from?'\r\n\r\n'My aunt.'\r\n\r\nAt this point I fell asleep again. I woke to hear him saying:\r\n\r\n'So what on earth am I to do?'\r\n\r\nJeeves flowed in with the tray, like some silent stream meandering over\r\nits mossy bed; and I saw daylight.\r\n\r\n'Read it again, Rocky, old top,' I said. 'I want Jeeves to hear it. Mr\r\nTodd's aunt has written him a rather rummy letter, Jeeves, and we want\r\nyour advice.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nHe stood in the middle of the room, registering devotion to the cause,\r\nand Rocky started again:\r\n\r\n    'My dear Rockmetteller,\r\n\r\n    'I have been thinking things over for a long while, and I have come\r\n    to the conclusion that I have been very thoughtless to wait so long\r\n    before doing what I am made up my mind to do now.'\r\n\r\n'What do you make of that, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'It seems a little obscure at present, sir, but no doubt it becomes\r\nclearer at a later point in the communication.'\r\n\r\n'Proceed, old scout,' I said, champing my bread and butter.\r\n\r\n    'You know how all my life I have longed to visit New York and see\r\n    for myself the wonderful gay life of which I have read so much. I\r\n    fear that now it will be impossible for me to fulfil my dream. I\r\n    am old and worn out. I seem to have no strength left in me.'\r\n\r\n'Sad, Jeeves, what?'\r\n\r\n'Extremely, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Sad nothing!' said Rocky. 'It's sheer laziness. I went to see her last\r\nChristmas and she was bursting with health. Her doctor told me himself\r\nthat there was nothing wrong with her whatever. But she will insist\r\nthat she's a hopeless invalid, so he has to agree with her. She's got\r\na fixed idea that the trip to New York would kill her; so, though it's\r\nbeen her ambition all her life to come here, she stays where she is.'\r\n\r\n'Rather like the chappie whose heart, was \"in the Highlands a-chasing\r\nof the deer\", Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'The cases are in some respects parallel, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Carry on, Rocky, dear boy.'\r\n\r\n    'So I have decided that, if I cannot enjoy all the marvels of the\r\n    city myself, I can at least enjoy them through you. I suddenly\r\n    thought of this yesterday after reading a beautiful poem in the\r\n    Sunday paper about a young man who had longed all his life for a\r\n    certain thing and won it in the end only when he was too old to\r\n    enjoy it. It was very sad, and it touched me.'\r\n\r\n'A thing,' interpolated Rocky bitterly, 'that I've not been able to do\r\nin ten years.'\r\n\r\n    'As you know, you will have my money when I am gone; but until now\r\n    I have never been able to see my way to giving you an allowance. I\r\n    have now decided to do so--on one condition. I have written to a\r\n    firm of lawyers in New York, giving them instructions to pay you\r\n    quite a substantial sum each month. My one condition is that you\r\n    live in New York and enjoy yourself as I have always wished to do.\r\n    I want you to be my representative, to spend this money for me as\r\n    I should do myself. I want you to plunge into the gay, prismatic\r\n    life of New York. I want you to be the life and soul of brilliant\r\n    supper parties.\r\n\r\n    'Above all, I want you--indeed, I insist on this--to write me\r\n    letters at least once a week, giving me a full description of all\r\n    you are doing and all that is going on in the city, so that I may\r\n    enjoy at second-hand what my wretched health prevents my enjoying\r\n    for myself. Remember that I shall expect full details, and that no\r\n    detail is too trivial to interest.\r\n\r\n                                                Your affectionate Aunt,\r\n\r\n                                                 Isabel Rockmetteller.'\r\n\r\n'What about it?' said Rocky.\r\n\r\n'What about it?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Yes. What on earth am I going to do?'\r\n\r\nIt was only then that I really got on to the extremely rummy attitude\r\nof the chappie, in view of the fact that a quite unexpected mess of\r\ngood cash had suddenly descended on him from a blue sky. To my mind it\r\nwas an occasion for the beaming smile and the joyous whoop; yet here\r\nthe man was, looking and talking as if Fate had swung on his solar\r\nplexus. It amazed me.\r\n\r\n'Aren't you bucked?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Bucked!'\r\n\r\n'If I were in your place I should be frightfully braced. I consider\r\nthis pretty soft for you.'\r\n\r\nHe gave a kind of yelp, stared at me for a moment, and then began to\r\ntalk of New York in a way that reminded me of Jimmy Mundy, the reformer\r\nbloke. Jimmy had just come to New York on a hit-the-trail campaign, and\r\nI had popped in at Madison Square Garden a couple of days before, for\r\nhalf an hour or so, to hear him. He had certainly told New York some\r\npretty straight things about itself, having apparently taken a dislike\r\nto the place, but, by Jove, you know, dear old Rocky made him look like\r\na publicity agent for the old metrop!\r\n\r\n'Pretty soft!' he cried. 'To have to come and live in New York! To have\r\nto leave my little cottage and take a stuffy, smelly, over-heated hole\r\nof an apartment in this Heaven-forsaken, festering Gehenna. To have\r\nto mix night after night with a mob who think that life is a sort of\r\nSt Vitus's dance, and imagine that they're having a good time because\r\nthey're making enough noise for six and drinking too much for ten. I\r\nloathe New York, Bertie. I wouldn't come near the place if I hadn't\r\ngot to see editors occasionally. There's a blight on it. It's got moral\r\ndelirium tremens. It's the limit. The very thought of staying more than\r\na day in it makes me sick. And you call this thing pretty soft for me!'\r\n\r\nI felt rather like Lot's friends must have done when they dropped in\r\nfor a quiet chat and their genial host began to criticize the Cities of\r\nthe Plain. I had no idea old Rocky could be so eloquent.\r\n\r\n'It would kill me to have to live in New York,' he went on. 'To have\r\nto share the air with six million people! To have to wear stiff\r\ncollars and decent clothes all the time! To--' He started. 'Good Lord!\r\nI suppose I should have to dress for dinner in the evenings. What a\r\nghastly notion!'\r\n\r\nI was shocked, absolutely shocked.\r\n\r\n'My dear chap!' I said, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n'Do you dress for dinner every night, Bertie?'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said coldly. 'How many suits of evening clothes have we?'\r\n\r\n'We have three suits of full evening dress, sir; two dinner jackets--'\r\n\r\n'Three.'\r\n\r\n'For practical purposes two only, sir. If you remember, we cannot wear\r\nthe third. We have also seven white waistcoats.'\r\n\r\n'And shirts?'\r\n\r\n'Four dozen, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And white ties?'\r\n\r\n'The first two shallow shelves in the chest of drawers are completely\r\nfilled with our white ties, sir.'\r\n\r\nI turned to Rocky.\r\n\r\n'You see?'\r\n\r\nThe chappie writhed like an electric fan.\r\n\r\n'I won't do it! I can't do it! I'll be hanged if I'll do it! How on\r\nearth can I dress up like that? Do you realize that most days I don't\r\nget out of my pyjamas till five in the afternoon, and then I just put\r\non an old sweater?'\r\n\r\nI saw Jeeves wince, poor chap. This sort of revelation shocked his\r\nfinest feelings.\r\n\r\n'Then, what are you going to do about it?' I said.\r\n\r\n'That's what I want to know.'\r\n\r\n'You might write and explain to your aunt.'\r\n\r\n'I might--if I wanted her to get round to her lawyer's in two rapid\r\nleaps and cut me out of her will.'\r\n\r\nI saw his point.\r\n\r\n'What do you suggest, Jeeves?' I said.\r\n\r\nJeeves cleared his throat respectfully.\r\n\r\n'The crux of the matter would appear to be, sir, that Mr Todd is\r\nobliged by the conditions under which the money is delivered into\r\nhis possession to write Miss Rockmetteller long and detailed letters\r\nrelating to his movements, and the only method by which this can\r\nbe accomplished, if Mr Todd adheres to his expressed intention of\r\nremaining in the country, is for Mr Todd to induce some second party to\r\ngather the actual experiences which Miss Rockmetteller wishes reported\r\nto her, and to convey these to him in the shape of a careful report, on\r\nwhich it would be possible for him, with the aid of his imagination, to\r\nbase the suggested correspondence.'\r\n\r\nHaving got which off the old diaphragm, Jeeves was silent. Rocky looked\r\nat me in a helpless sort of way. He hasn't been brought up on Jeeves as\r\nI have, and he isn't on to his curves.\r\n\r\n'Could he put it a little clearer, Bertie?' he said. 'I thought at the\r\nstart it was going to make sense, but it kind of flickered. What's the\r\nidea?'\r\n\r\n'My dear old man, perfectly simple. I knew we could stand on Jeeves.\r\nAll you've got to do is to get somebody to go round the town for you\r\nand take a few notes, and then you work the notes up into letters.\r\nThat's it, isn't it, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Precisely, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe light of hope gleamed in Rocky's eyes. He looked at Jeeves in a\r\nstartled way, dazed by the man's vast intellect.\r\n\r\n'But who would do it?' he said. 'It would have to be a pretty smart\r\nsort of man, a man who would notice things.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves!' I said. 'Let Jeeves do it.'\r\n\r\n'But would he?'\r\n\r\n'You would do it, wouldn't you, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our long connexion I observed Jeeves almost\r\nsmile. The corner of his mouth curved quite a quarter of an inch, and\r\nfor a moment his eye ceased to look like a meditative fish's.\r\n\r\n'I should be delighted to oblige, sir. As a matter of fact, I have\r\nalready visited some of New York's places of interest on my evening\r\nout, and it would be most enjoyable to make a practice of the pursuit.'\r\n\r\n'Fine! I know exactly what your aunt wants to hear about, Rocky. She\r\nwants an earful of cabaret stuff. The place you ought to go to first,\r\nJeeves, is Reigelheimer's. It's on Forty-second Street. Anybody will\r\nshow you the way.'\r\n\r\nJeeves shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, sir. People are no longer going to Reigelheimer's. The\r\nplace at the moment is Frolics on the Roof.'\r\n\r\n'You see?' I said to Rocky. 'Leave it to Jeeves. He knows.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt isn't often that you find an entire group of your fellow-humans\r\nhappy in this world; but our little circle was certainly an example of\r\nthe fact that it can be done. We were all full of beans. Everything\r\nwent absolutely right from the start.\r\n\r\nJeeves was happy, partly because he loves to exercise his giant brain,\r\nand partly because he was having a corking time among the bright\r\nlights. I saw him one night at the Midnight Revels. He was sitting at a\r\ntable on the edge of the dancing floor, doing himself remarkably well\r\nwith a fat cigar. His face wore an expression of austere benevolence,\r\nand he was making notes in a small book.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of us, I was feeling pretty good, because I was fond\r\nof old Rocky and glad to be able to do him a good turn. Rocky was\r\nperfectly contented, because he was still able to sit on fences in his\r\npyjamas and watch worms. And, as for the aunt, she seemed tickled to\r\ndeath. She was getting Broadway at pretty long range, but it seemed to\r\nbe hitting her just right. I read one of her letters to Rocky, and it\r\nwas full of life.\r\n\r\nBut then Rocky's letters, based on Jeeves's notes, were enough to\r\nbuck anybody up. It was rummy when you came to think of it. There was\r\nI, loving the life, while the mere mention of it gave Rocky a tired\r\nfeeling; yet here is a letter I wrote home to a pal of mine in London:\r\n\r\n    Dear Freddie,\r\n\r\n    Well, here I am in New York. It's not a bad place. I'm not having a\r\n    bad time. Everything's not bad. The cabarets aren't bad. Don't know\r\n    when I shall be back. How's everybody? Cheerio!\r\n\r\n                                                                 Yours,\r\n\r\n                                                                Bertie.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--Seen old Ted lately?\r\n\r\nNot that I cared about old Ted; but if I hadn't dragged him in I\r\ncouldn't have got the confounded thing on to the second page.\r\n\r\nNow here's old Rocky on exactly the same subject:\r\n\r\n    Dearest Aunt Isabel,\r\n\r\n    How can I ever thank you enough for giving me the opportunity to\r\n    live in this astounding city! New York seems more wonderful every\r\n    day.\r\n\r\n    Fifth Avenue is at its best, of course, just now. The dresses are\r\n    magnificent!\r\n\r\nWads of stuff about the dresses. I didn't know Jeeves was such an\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n    I was out with some of the crowd at the Midnight Revels the other\r\n    night. We took in a show first, after a little dinner at a new place\r\n    on Forty-third Street. We were quite a gay party. Georgie Cohan\r\n    looked in about midnight and got off a good story about Willie\r\n    Collier. Fred Stone could only stay a minute, but Doug. Fairbanks\r\n    did all sorts of stunts and made us roar. Ed Wynn was there, and\r\n    Laurette Taylor showed up with a party. The show at the Revels is\r\n    quite good. I am enclosing a programme.\r\n\r\n    Last night a few of us went round to Frolics on the Roof--\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so forth, yards of it. I suppose it's the artistic\r\ntemperament or something. What I mean is, it's easier for a chappie\r\nwho's used to writing poems and that sort of tosh to put a bit of a\r\npunch into a letter than it is for a fellow like me. Anyway, there's no\r\ndoubt that Rocky's correspondence was hot stuff. I called Jeeves in and\r\ncongratulated him.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, you're a wonder!'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'How you notice everything at these places beats me. I couldn't tell\r\nyou a thing about them, except that I've had a good time.'\r\n\r\n'It's just a knack, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Mr Todd's letters ought to brace Miss Rockmetteller all right,\r\nwhat?'\r\n\r\n'Undoubtedly, sir,' agreed Jeeves.\r\n\r\nAnd, by Jove, they did! They certainly did, by George! What I mean to\r\nsay is, I was sitting in the apartment one afternoon, about a month\r\nafter the thing had started, smoking a cigarette and resting the old\r\nbean, when the door opened and the voice of Jeeves burst the silence\r\nlike a bomb.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't that he spoke loud. He has one of those soft, soothing voices\r\nthat slide through the atmosphere like the note of a far-off sheep. It\r\nwas what he said that made me leap like a young gazelle.\r\n\r\n'Miss Rockmetteller!'\r\n\r\nAnd in came a large, solid female.\r\n\r\nThe situation floored me. I'm not denying it. Hamlet must have felt\r\nmuch as I did when his father's ghost bobbed up in the fairway. I'd\r\ncome to look on Rocky's aunt as such a permanency at her own home that\r\nit didn't seem possible that she could really be here in New York. I\r\nstared at her. Then I looked at Jeeves. He was standing there in an\r\nattitude of dignified detachment, the chump, when, if ever he should\r\nhave been rallying round the young master, it was now.\r\n\r\nRocky's aunt looked less like an invalid than anyone I've ever seen,\r\nexcept my Aunt Agatha. She had a good deal of Aunt Agatha about her,\r\nas a matter of fact. She looked as if she might be deucedly dangerous\r\nif put upon; and something seemed to tell me that she would certainly\r\nregard herself as put upon if she ever found out the game which poor\r\nold Rocky had been pulling on her.\r\n\r\n'Good afternoon,' I managed to say.\r\n\r\n'How do you do?' she said. 'Mr Cohan?'\r\n\r\n'Er--no.'\r\n\r\n'Mr Fred Stone?'\r\n\r\n'Not absolutely. As a matter of fact, my name's Wooster--Bertie\r\nWooster.'\r\n\r\nShe seemed disappointed. The fine old name of Wooster appeared to mean\r\nnothing in her life.\r\n\r\n'Isn't Rockmetteller home?' she said. 'Where is he?'\r\n\r\nShe had me with the first shot. I couldn't think of anything to say. I\r\ncouldn't tell her that Rocky was down in the country, watching worms.\r\n\r\nThere was the faintest flutter of sound in the background. It was the\r\nrespectful cough with which Jeeves announces that he is about to speak\r\nwithout having been spoken to.\r\n\r\n'If you remember, sir, Mr Todd went out in the automobile with a party\r\nearlier in the afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'So he did, Jeeves; so he did,' I said, looking at my watch. 'Did he\r\nsay when he would be back?'\r\n\r\n'He gave me to understand, sir, that he would be somewhat late in\r\nreturning.'\r\n\r\nHe vanished; and the aunt took the chair which I'd forgotten to offer\r\nher. She looked at me in rather a rummy way. It was a nasty look. It\r\nmade me feel as if I were something the dog had brought in and intended\r\nto bury later on, when he had time. My own Aunt Agatha, back in\r\nEngland, has looked at me in exactly the same way many a time, and it\r\nnever fails to make my spine curl.\r\n\r\n'You seem very much at home here, young man. Are you a great friend of\r\nRockmetteller's?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, rather!'\r\n\r\nShe frowned as if she had expected better things of old Rocky.\r\n\r\n'Well, you need to be,' she said, 'the way you treat his flat as your\r\nown!'\r\n\r\nI give you my word, this quite unforeseen slam simply robbed me of the\r\npower of speech. I'd been looking on myself in the light of the dashing\r\nhost, and suddenly to be treated as an intruder jarred me. It wasn't,\r\nmark you, as if she had spoken in a way to suggest that she considered\r\nmy presence in the place as an ordinary social call. She obviously\r\nlooked on me as a cross between a burglar and the plumber's man come to\r\nfix the leak in the bathroom. It hurt her--my being there.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, with the conversation showing every sign of being\r\nabout to die in awful agonies, an idea came to me. Tea--the good old\r\nstand-by.\r\n\r\n'Would you care for a cup of tea?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Tea?'\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if she had never heard of the stuff.\r\n\r\n'Nothing like a cup after a journey,' I said. 'Bucks you up! Puts a bit\r\nof zip into you. What I mean is, restores you, and so on, don't you\r\nknow. I'll go and tell Jeeves.'\r\n\r\nI tottered down the passage to Jeeves's lair. The man was reading the\r\nevening paper as if he hadn't a care in the world.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'we want some tea.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I say, Jeeves, this is a bit thick, what?'\r\n\r\nI wanted sympathy, don't you know--sympathy and kindness. The old nerve\r\ncentres had had the deuce of a shock.\r\n\r\n'She's got the idea this place belongs to Mr Todd. What on earth put\r\nthat into her head?'\r\n\r\nJeeves filled the kettle with a restrained dignity.\r\n\r\n'No doubt because of Mr Todd's letters, sir,' he said. 'It was my\r\nsuggestion, sir, if you remember, that they should be addressed from\r\nthis apartment in order that Mr Todd should appear to possess a good\r\ncentral residence in the city.'\r\n\r\nI remembered. We had thought it a brainy scheme at the time.\r\n\r\n'Well, it's dashed awkward, you know, Jeeves. She looks on me as an\r\nintruder. By Jove! I suppose she thinks I'm someone who hangs about\r\nhere, touching Mr Todd for free meals and borrowing his shirts.'\r\n\r\n'Extremely probable, sir.'\r\n\r\n'It's pretty rotten you know.'\r\n\r\n'Most disturbing, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And there's another thing: What are we to do about Mr Todd? We've got\r\nto get him up here as soon as ever we can. When you have brought the\r\ntea you had better go out and send him a telegram, telling him to come\r\nup by the next train.'\r\n\r\n'I have already done so, sir. I took the liberty of writing the message\r\nand dispatching it by the lift attendant.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove, you think of everything, Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir. A little buttered toast with the tea? Just so, sir.\r\nThank you.'\r\n\r\nI went back to the sitting-room. She hadn't moved an inch. She was\r\nstill bolt upright on the edge of her chair, gripping her umbrella like\r\na hammer-thrower. She gave me another of those looks as I came in.\r\nThere was no doubt about it; for some reason she had taken a dislike to\r\nme. I suppose because I wasn't George M. Cohan. It was a bit hard on a\r\nchap.\r\n\r\n'This is a surprise, what?' I said, after about five minutes' restful\r\nsilence, trying to crank the conversation up again.\r\n\r\n'What is a surprise?'\r\n\r\n'Your coming here, don't you know, and so on.'\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyebrows and drank me in a bit more through her glasses.\r\n\r\n'Why is it surprising that I should visit my only nephew?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Oh, rather,' I said. 'Of course! Certainly. What I mean is--'\r\n\r\nJeeves projected himself into the room with the tea. I was jolly glad\r\nto see him. There's nothing like having a bit of business arranged for\r\none when one isn't certain of one's lines. With the teapot to fool\r\nabout with I felt happier.\r\n\r\n'Tea, tea, tea--what! What!' I said.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't what I had meant to say. My idea had been to be a good deal\r\nmore formal, and so on. Still, it covered the situation. I poured her\r\nout a cup. She sipped it and put the cup down with a shudder.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to say, young man,' she said, frostily, 'that you expect\r\nme to drink this stuff?'\r\n\r\n'Rather! Bucks you up, you know.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean by the expression \"Bucks you up\"?'\r\n\r\n'Well, makes you full of beans, you know. Makes you fizz.'\r\n\r\n'I don't understand a word you say. You're English, aren't you?'\r\n\r\nI admitted it. She didn't say a word. And she did it in a way that made\r\nit worse than if she had spoken for hours. Somehow it was brought home\r\nto me that she didn't like Englishmen, and that if she had had to meet\r\nan Englishman I was the one she'd have chosen last.\r\n\r\nConversation languished once more after that.\r\n\r\nThen I tried again. I was becoming more convinced every moment that you\r\ncan't make a real lively _salon_ with a couple of people, especially if\r\none of them lets it go a word at a time.\r\n\r\n'Are you comfortable at your hotel?' I said.\r\n\r\n'At which hotel?'\r\n\r\n'The hotel you're staying at.'\r\n\r\n'I am not staying at an hotel.'\r\n\r\n'Stopping with friends--what?'\r\n\r\n'I am naturally stopping with my nephew.'\r\n\r\nI didn't get it for the moment; then it hit me.\r\n\r\n'What! Here?' I gurgled.\r\n\r\n'Certainly! Where else should I go?'\r\n\r\nThe full horror of the situation rolled over me like a wave. I couldn't\r\nsee what on earth I was to do. I couldn't explain that this wasn't\r\nRocky's flat without giving the poor old chap away hopelessly, because\r\nshe would then ask me where he did live, and then he would be right in\r\nthe soup. I was trying to recover from the shock when she spoke again.\r\n\r\n'Will you kindly tell my nephew's manservant to prepare my room? I wish\r\nto lie down.'\r\n\r\n'Your nephew's manservant?'\r\n\r\n'The man you call Jeeves. If Rockmetteller has gone for an automobile\r\nride there is no need for you to wait for him. He will naturally wish\r\nto be alone with me when he returns.'\r\n\r\nI found myself tottering out of the room. The thing was too much for\r\nme. I crept into Jeeves's den.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves!' I whispered.\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Mix me a b-and-s, Jeeves. I feel weak.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'This is getting thicker every minute, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'She thinks you're Mr Todd's man. She thinks the whole place is his,\r\nand everything in it. I don't see what you're to do, except stay on and\r\nkeep it up. We can't say anything or she'll get on to the whole thing,\r\nand I don't want to let Mr Todd down. By the way, Jeeves, she wants you\r\nto prepare her bed.'\r\n\r\nHe looked wounded.\r\n\r\n'It is hardly my place, sir--'\r\n\r\n'I know--I know. But do it as a personal favour to me. If you come to\r\nthat, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and\r\nhave to go to an hotel, what?'\r\n\r\n'Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir? What will you do for\r\nclothes?'\r\n\r\n'Good Lord! I hadn't thought of that. Can you put a few things in a bag\r\nwhen she isn't looking, and sneak them down to me at the St Aurea?'\r\n\r\n'I will endeavour to do so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't think there's anything more, is there? Tell Mr Todd\r\nwhere I am when he gets here.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nI looked round the place. The moment of parting had come. I felt sad.\r\nThe whole thing reminded me of one of those melodramas where they drive\r\nchappies out of the old homestead into the snow.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, Jeeves,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, sir.'\r\n\r\nAnd I staggered out.\r\n\r\nYou know, I rather think I agree with those poet-and-philosopher\r\nJohnnies who insist that a fellow ought to be devilish pleased if\r\nhe has a bit of trouble. All that stuff about being refined by\r\nsuffering, you know. Suffering does give a chap a sort of broader and\r\nmore sympathetic outlook. It helps you to understand other people's\r\nmisfortunes if you've been through the same thing yourself.\r\n\r\nAs I stood in my lonely bedroom at the hotel, trying to tie my white\r\ntie myself, it struck me for the first time that there must be whole\r\nsquads of chappies in the world who had to get along without a man to\r\nlook after them. I'd always thought of Jeeves as a kind of natural\r\nphenomenon; but, by Jove! of course, when you come to think of it,\r\nthere must be quite a lot of fellows who have to press their own\r\nclothes themselves, and haven't got anybody to bring them tea in the\r\nmorning, and so on. It was rather a solemn thought, don't you know. I\r\nmean to say, ever since then I've been able to appreciate the frightful\r\nprivations the poor have to stick.\r\n\r\nI got dressed somehow. Jeeves hadn't forgotten a thing in his packing.\r\nEverything was there, down to the final stud. I'm not sure this didn't\r\nmake me feel worse. It kind of deepened the pathos. It was like what\r\nsomebody or other wrote about the touch of a vanished hand.\r\n\r\nI had a bit of dinner somewhere and went to a show of some kind; but\r\nnothing seemed to make any difference. I simply hadn't the heart to go\r\non to supper anywhere. I just went straight up to bed. I don't know\r\nwhen I've felt so rotten. Somehow I found myself moving about the\r\nroom softly, as if there had been a death in the family. If I had had\r\nanybody to talk to I should have talked in a whisper; in fact, when the\r\ntelephone-bell rang I answered in such a sad, hushed voice that the\r\nfellow at the other end of the wire said 'Hallo!' five times, thinking\r\nhe hadn't got me.\r\n\r\nIt was Rocky. The poor old scout was deeply agitated.\r\n\r\n'Bertie! Is that you, Bertie? Oh, gosh! I'm having a time!'\r\n\r\n'Where are you speaking from?'\r\n\r\n'The Midnight Revels. We've been here an hour, and I think we're a\r\nfixture for the night. I've told Aunt Isabel I've gone out to call up\r\na friend to join us. She's glued to a chair, with this-is-the-life\r\nwritten all over her, taking it in through the pores. She loves it, and\r\nI'm nearly crazy.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me all, old top,' I said.\r\n\r\n'A little more of this,' he said, 'and I shall sneak quietly off to\r\nthe river and end it all. Do you mean to say you go through this sort\r\nof thing every night, Bertie, and enjoy it? It's simply infernal! I\r\nwas just snatching a wink of sleep behind the bill of fare just now\r\nwhen about a million yelling girls swooped down, with toy balloons.\r\nThere are two orchestras here, each trying to see if it can't play\r\nlouder than the other. I'm a mental and physical wreck. When your\r\ntelegram arrived I was just lying down for a quiet pipe, with a sense\r\nof absolute peace stealing over me. I had to get dressed and sprint two\r\nmiles to catch the train. It nearly gave me heart-failure; and on top\r\nof that I almost got brain fever inventing lies to tell Aunt Isabel.\r\nAnd then I had to cram myself into these confounded evening clothes of\r\nyours.'\r\n\r\nI gave a sharp wail of agony. It hadn't struck me till then that Rocky\r\nwas depending on my wardrobe to see him through.\r\n\r\n'You'll ruin them!'\r\n\r\n'I hope so,' said Rocky in the most unpleasant way. His troubles seemed\r\nto have had the worst effect on his character. 'I should like to get\r\nback at them somehow; they've given me a bad enough time. They're about\r\nthree sizes too small, and something's apt to give at any moment. I\r\nwish to goodness it would, and give me a chance to breathe. I haven't\r\nbreathed since half past seven. Thank heaven, Jeeves managed to get out\r\nand buy me a collar that fitted, or I should be a strangled corpse\r\nby now! It was touch and go till the stud broke. Bertie, this is pure\r\nHades! Aunt Isabel keeps on urging me to dance. How on earth can I\r\ndance when I don't know a soul to dance with? And how the deuce could\r\nI, even if I knew every girl in the place? It's taking big chances even\r\nto move in these trousers. I had to tell her I've hurt my ankle. She\r\nkeeps asking me when Cohan and Stone are going to turn up; and it's\r\nsimply a question of time before she discovers that Stone is sitting\r\ntwo tables away. Something's got to be done, Bertie! You've got to\r\nthink up some way of getting me out of this mess. It was you who got me\r\ninto it.'\r\n\r\n'Me! What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Well, Jeeves, then. It's all the same. It was you who suggested\r\nleaving it to Jeeves. It was those letters I wrote from his notes that\r\ndid the mischief. I made them too good. My aunt's just been telling me\r\nabout it. She says she had resigned herself to ending her life where\r\nshe was, and then my letters began to arrive, describing the joys of\r\nNew York; and they stimulated her to such an extent that she pulled\r\nherself together and made the trip. She seems to think she's had some\r\nmiraculous kind of faith cure. I tell you I can't stand it, Bertie!\r\nIt's got to end!'\r\n\r\n'Can't Jeeves think of anything?'\r\n\r\n'No. He just hangs round, saying: \"Most disturbing, sir!\" A fat lot of\r\nhelp that is!'\r\n\r\n'Well, old lad,' I said, 'after all, it's far worse for me than it is\r\nfor you. You've got a comfortable home and Jeeves. And you're saving a\r\nlot of money.'\r\n\r\n'Saving money? What do you mean--saving money?'\r\n\r\n'Why, the allowance your aunt was giving you. I suppose she's paying\r\nall the expenses now, isn't she?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly she is: but she's stopped the allowance. She wrote the\r\nlawyers tonight. She says that, now she's in New York, there is no\r\nnecessity for it to go on, as we shall always be together, and it's\r\nsimpler for her to look after that end of it. I tell you, Bertie, I've\r\nexamined the darned cloud with a microscope, and if it's got a silver\r\nlining it's some little dissembler!'\r\n\r\n'But, Rocky, old top, it's too bally awful! You've no notion of what\r\nI'm going through in this beastly hotel, without Jeeves. I must get\r\nback to the flat.'\r\n\r\n'Don't come near the flat!'\r\n\r\n'But it's my own flat.'\r\n\r\n'I can't help that. Aunt Isabel doesn't like you. She asked me what you\r\ndid for a living. And when I told her you didn't do anything she said\r\nshe thought as much, and that you were a typical specimen of a useless\r\nand decaying aristocracy. So if you think you have made a hit, forget\r\nit. Now I must be going back, or she'll be coming out here after me.\r\nGood-bye.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning Jeeves came round. It was all so home-like when he floated\r\nnoiselessly into the room that I nearly broke down.\r\n\r\n'Good morning, sir,' he said. 'I have brought a few more of your\r\npersonal belongings.'\r\n\r\nHe began to unstrap the suit-case he was carrying.\r\n\r\n'Did you have any trouble sneaking them away?'\r\n\r\n'It was not easy, sir. I had to watch my chance. Miss Rockmetteller is\r\na remarkably alert lady.'\r\n\r\n'You know, Jeeves, say what you like--this _is_ a bit thick, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'The situation is certainly one that has never before come under my\r\nnotice, sir. I have brought the heather-mixture suit, as the climatic\r\nconditions are congenial. Tomorrow, if not prevented, I will endeavour\r\nto add the brown lounge with the faint green twill.'\r\n\r\n'It can't go on--this sort of thing--Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'We must hope for the best, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Can't you think of anything to do?'\r\n\r\n'I have been giving the matter considerable thought, sir, but so far\r\nwithout success. I am placing three silk shirts--the dove-coloured, the\r\nlight blue, and the mauve--in the first long drawer, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean to say you can't think of anything, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'For the moment, sir, no. You will find a dozen handkerchiefs and the\r\ntan socks in the upper drawer on the left.' He strapped the suit-case\r\nand put it on a chair. 'A curious lady, Miss Rockmetteller, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You understate it, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\nHe gazed meditatively out of the window.\r\n\r\n'In many ways, sir, Miss Rockmetteller reminds me of an aunt of mine\r\nwho resides in the south-east portion of London. Their temperaments\r\nare much alike. My aunt has the same taste for the pleasures of the\r\ngreat city. It is a passion with her to ride in hansom cabs, sir.\r\nWhenever the family take their eyes off her she escapes from the house\r\nand spends the day riding about in cabs. On several occasions she has\r\nbroken into the children's savings bank to secure the means to enable\r\nher to gratify this desire.'\r\n\r\n'I love to have these little chats with you about your female\r\nrelatives, Jeeves,' I said coldly, for I felt that the man had let me\r\ndown, and I was fed up with him. 'But I don't see what all this has got\r\nto do with my trouble.'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon, sir. I am leaving a small assortment of our\r\nneckties on the mantelpiece, sir, for you to select according to your\r\npreference. I should recommend the blue with the red domino pattern,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\nThen he streamed imperceptibly towards the door and flowed silently out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI've often heard that fellows after some great shock or loss have a\r\nhabit, after they've been on the floor for a while wondering what\r\nhit them, of picking themselves up and piecing themselves together,\r\nand sort of taking a whirl at beginning a new life. Time, the great\r\nhealer, and Nature adjusting itself and so on and so forth. There's a\r\nlot in it. I know, because in my own case, after a day or two of what\r\nyou might call prostration, I began to recover. The frightful loss of\r\nJeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery, but at\r\nleast I found that I was able to have a dash at enjoying life again.\r\nWhat I mean is, I braced up to the extent of going round the cabarets\r\nonce more, so as to try to forget, if only for the moment.\r\n\r\nNew York's a small place when it comes to the part of it that wakes up\r\njust as the rest is going to bed, and it wasn't long before my tracks\r\nbegan to cross old Rocky's. I saw him once at Peale's, and again at\r\nFrolics on the Roof. There wasn't anybody with him either time except\r\nthe aunt, and, though he was trying to look as if he had struck the\r\nideal life, it wasn't difficult for me, knowing the circumstances, to\r\nsee that beneath the mask the poor chap was suffering. My heart bled\r\nfor the fellow. At least, what there was of it that wasn't bleeding for\r\nmyself bled for him. He had the air of one who was about to crack under\r\nthe strain.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the aunt was looking slightly upset also. I took\r\nit that she was beginning to wonder when the celebrities were going to\r\nsurge round, and what had suddenly become of all those wild, careless\r\nspirits Rocky used to mix with in his letters. I didn't blame her. I\r\nhad only read a couple of his letters, but they certainly gave the\r\nimpression that poor old Rocky was by way of being the hub of New\r\nYork night life, and that, if by any chance he failed to show up at a\r\ncabaret, the management said, 'What's the use?' and put up the shutters.\r\n\r\nThe next two nights I didn't come across them, but the night after\r\nthat I was sitting by myself at the Maison Pierre when somebody tapped\r\nme on the shoulder-blade, and I found Rocky standing beside me, with\r\na sort of mixed expression of wistfulness and apoplexy on his face.\r\nHow the man had contrived to wear my evening clothes so many times\r\nwithout disaster was a mystery to me. He confided later that early in\r\nthe proceedings he had slit the waistcoat up the back and that that had\r\nhelped a lot.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I had the idea that he had managed to get away from his\r\naunt for the evening; but, looking past him, I saw that she was in\r\nagain. She was at a table over by the wall, looking at me as if I were\r\nsomething the management ought to be complained to about.\r\n\r\n'Bertie, old scout,' said Rocky, in a quiet, sort of crushed voice,\r\n'we've always been pals, haven't we? I mean, you know I'd do you a good\r\nturn if you asked me.'\r\n\r\n'My dear old lad,' I said. The man had moved me.\r\n\r\n'Then, for Heaven's sake, come over and sit at our table for the rest\r\nof the evening.'\r\n\r\nWell, you know, there are limits to the sacred claims of friendship.\r\n\r\n'My dear chap,' I said, 'you know I'd do anything in reason; but--'\r\n\r\n'You must come, Bertie. You've got to. Something's got to be done to\r\ndivert her mind. She's brooding about something. She's been like that\r\nfor the last two days. I think she's beginning to suspect. She can't\r\nunderstand why we never seem to meet anyone I know at these joints.\r\nA few nights ago I happened to run into two newspaper men I used to\r\nknow fairly well. That kept me going for a while. I introduced them\r\nto Aunt Isabel as David Belasco and Jim Corbett, and it went well.\r\nBut the effect has worn off now, and she's beginning to wonder again.\r\nSomething's got to be done, or she will find out everything, and if she\r\ndoes I'd take a nickel for my chance of getting a cent from her later\r\non. So, for the love of Mike, come across to our table and help things\r\nalong.'\r\n\r\nI went along. One has to rally round a pal in distress. Aunt Isabel\r\nwas sitting bolt upright, as usual. It certainly did seem as if she\r\nhad lost a bit of the zest with which she had started out to explore\r\nBroadway. She looked as if she had been thinking a good deal about\r\nrather unpleasant things.\r\n\r\n'You've met Bertie Wooster, Aunt Isabel?' said Rocky.\r\n\r\n'I have.'\r\n\r\n'Take a seat, Bertie,' said Rocky.\r\n\r\nAnd so the merry party began. It was one of those jolly, happy,\r\nbread-crumbling parties where you cough twice before you speak, and\r\nthen decide not to say it after all. After we had had an hour of this\r\nwild dissipation, Aunt Isabel said she wanted to go home. In the light\r\nof what Rocky had been telling me, this struck me as sinister. I had\r\ngathered that at the beginning of her visit she had had to be dragged\r\nhome with ropes.\r\n\r\nIt must have hit Rocky the same way, for he gave me a pleading look.\r\n\r\n'You'll come along, won't you, Bertie, and have a drink at the flat?'\r\n\r\nI had a feeling that this wasn't in the contract, but there wasn't\r\nanything to be done. It seemed brutal to leave the poor chap alone with\r\nthe woman, so I went along.\r\n\r\nRight from the start, from the moment we stepped into the taxi, the\r\nfeeling began to grow that something was about to break loose. A\r\nmassive silence prevailed in the corner where the aunt sat, and, though\r\nRocky, balancing himself on the little seat in front, did his best to\r\nsupply dialogue, we weren't a chatty party.\r\n\r\nI had a glimpse of Jeeves as we went into the flat, sitting in his\r\nlair, and I wished I could have called to him to rally round. Something\r\ntold me that I was about to need him.\r\n\r\nThe stuff was on the table in the sitting-room. Rocky took up the\r\ndecanter.\r\n\r\n'Say when, Bertie.'\r\n\r\n'Stop!' barked the aunt, and he dropped it.\r\n\r\nI caught Rocky's eye as he stooped to pick up the ruins. It was the eye\r\nof one who sees it coming.\r\n\r\n'Leave it there, Rockmetteller!' said Aunt Isabel; and Rocky left it\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n'The time has come to speak,' she said. 'I cannot stand idly by and see\r\na young man going to perdition!'\r\n\r\nPoor old Rocky gave a sort of gurgle, a kind of sound rather like the\r\nwhisky had made running out of the decanter on to my carpet.\r\n\r\n'Eh?' he said, blinking.\r\n\r\nThe aunt proceeded.\r\n\r\n'The fault,' she said, 'was mine. I had not then seen the light. But\r\nnow my eyes are open. I see the hideous mistake I have made. I shudder\r\nat the thought of the wrong I did you, Rockmetteller, by urging you\r\ninto contact with this wicked city.'\r\n\r\nI saw Rocky grope feebly for the table. His fingers touched it, and\r\na look of relief came into the poor chappie's face. I understood his\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n'But when I wrote you that letter, Rockmetteller, instructing you to go\r\nto the city and live its life, I had not had the privilege of hearing\r\nMr Mundy speak on the subject of New York.'\r\n\r\n'Jimmy Mundy!' I cried.\r\n\r\nYou know how it is sometimes when everything seems all mixed up and\r\nyou suddenly get a clue. When she mentioned Jimmy Mundy I began to\r\nunderstand more or less what had happened. I'd seen it happen before. I\r\nremember, back in England, the man I had before Jeeves sneaked off to a\r\nmeeting on his evening out and came back and denounced me in front of a\r\ncrowd of chappies I was giving a bit of supper to as a useless blot on\r\nthe fabric of Society.\r\n\r\nThe aunt gave me a withering up and down.\r\n\r\n'Yes; Jimmy Mundy!' she said. 'I am surprised at a man of your stamp\r\nhaving heard of him. There is no music, there are no drunken, dancing\r\nmen, no shameless, flaunting women at his meetings; so for you they\r\nwould have no attraction. But for others, less dead in sin, he has his\r\nmessage. He has come to save New York from itself; to force it--in\r\nhis picturesque phrase--to hit the trail. It was three days ago,\r\nRockmetteller, that I first heard him. It was an accident that took me\r\nto his meeting. How often in this life a mere accident may shape our\r\nwhole future!\r\n\r\n'You had been called away by that telephone message from Mr Belasco;\r\nso you could not take me to the Hippodrome, as we had arranged. I\r\nasked your manservant, Jeeves, to take me there. The man has very\r\nlittle intelligence. He seems to have misunderstood me. I am thankful\r\nthat he did. He took me to what I subsequently learned was Madison\r\nSquare Garden, where Mr Mundy is holding his meetings. He escorted me\r\nto a seat and then left me. And it was not till the meeting had begun\r\nthat I discovered the mistake which had been made. My seat was in the\r\nmiddle of a row. I could not leave without inconveniencing a great many\r\npeople, so I remained.'\r\n\r\nShe gulped.\r\n\r\n'Rockmetteller, I have never been so thankful for anything else. Mr\r\nMundy was wonderful! He was like some prophet of old, scouring the\r\nsins of the people. He leaped about in a frenzy of inspiration till I\r\nfeared he would do himself an injury. Sometimes he expressed himself in\r\na somewhat odd manner, but every word carried conviction. He showed me\r\nNew York in its true colours. He showed me the vanity and wickedness\r\nof sitting in gilded haunts of vice, eating lobster when decent people\r\nshould be in bed.\r\n\r\n'He said that the tango and the fox-trot were devices of the devil\r\nto drag people down into the Bottomless Pit. He said that there was\r\nmore sin in ten minutes with a negro banjo orchestra than in all the\r\nancient revels of Nineveh and Babylon. And when he stood on one leg\r\nand pointed right at where I was sitting and shouted \"This means you!\"\r\nI could have sunk through the floor. I came away a changed woman.\r\nSurely you must have noticed the change in me, Rockmetteller? You must\r\nhave seen that I was no longer the careless, thoughtless person who had\r\nurged you to dance in those places of wickedness?'\r\n\r\nRocky was holding on to the table as if it was his only friend.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he stammered; 'I--I thought something was wrong.'\r\n\r\n'Wrong? Something was right! Everything was right! Rockmetteller, it\r\nis not too late for you to be saved. You have only sipped of the evil\r\ncup. You have not drained it. It will be hard at first, but you will\r\nfind that you can do it if you fight with a stout heart against the\r\nglamour and fascination of this dreadful city. Won't you, for my sake,\r\ntry, Rockmetteller? Won't you go to the country tomorrow and begin the\r\nstruggle? Little by little, if you use your will--'\r\n\r\nI can't help thinking it must have been that word 'will' that roused\r\ndear old Rocky like a trumpet call. It must have brought home to him\r\nthe realization that a miracle had come off and saved him from being\r\ncut out of Aunt Isabel's. At any rate, as she said it he perked up, let\r\ngo of the table, and faced her with gleaming eyes.\r\n\r\n'Do you want me to go to the country, Aunt Isabel?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'To live in the country?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Rockmetteller.'\r\n\r\n'Stay in the country all the time? Never come to New York?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Rockmetteller; I mean just that. It is the only way. Only there\r\ncan you be safe from temptation. Will you do it, Rockmetteller? Will\r\nyou--for my sake?'\r\n\r\nRocky grabbed the table again. He seemed to draw a lot of encouragement\r\nfrom that table.\r\n\r\n'I will!' he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said. It was next day, and I was back in the old flat,\r\nlying in the old arm-chair, with my feet upon the good old table. I had\r\njust come from seeing dear old Rocky off to his country cottage, and an\r\nhour before he had seen his aunt off to whatever hamlet it was that she\r\nwas the curse of; so we were alone at last. 'Jeeves, there's no place\r\nlike home--what?'\r\n\r\n'Very true, sir.'\r\n\r\n'The jolly old roof-tree, and all that sort of thing--what?'\r\n\r\n'Precisely, sir.'\r\n\r\nI lit another cigarette.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Do you know, at one point in the business I really thought you were\r\nbaffled.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'When did you get the idea of taking Miss Rockmetteller to the meeting?\r\nIt was pure genius!'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir. It came to me a little suddenly, one morning when I\r\nwas thinking of my aunt, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Your aunt? The hansom cab one?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. I recollected that, whenever we observed one of her attacks\r\ncoming on, we used to send for the clergyman of the parish. We always\r\nfound that if he talked to her a while of higher things it diverted her\r\nmind from hansom cabs. It occurred to me that the same treatment might\r\nprove efficacious in the case of Miss Rockmetteller.'\r\n\r\nI was stunned by the man's resource.\r\n\r\n'It's brain,' I said; 'pure brain! What do you do to get like that,\r\nJeeves? I believe you must eat a lot of fish, or something. Do you eat\r\na lot of fish, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, then, it's just a gift, I take it; and if you aren't born\r\nthat way there's no use worrying.'\r\n\r\n'Precisely, sir,' said Jeeves. 'If I might make the suggestion, sir, I\r\nshould not continue to wear your present tie. The green shade gives you\r\na slightly bilious air. I should strongly advocate the blue with the\r\nred domino pattern instead, sir.'\r\n\r\n'All right, Jeeves,' I said humbly. 'You know!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   6--The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\r\n\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, emerging from the old tub, 'rally round.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nI beamed on the man with no little geniality. I was putting in a week\r\nor two in Paris at the moment, and there's something about Paris that\r\nalways makes me feel fairly full of _espièglerie_ and _joie de vivre_.\r\n\r\n'Lay out our gent's medium-smart raiment, suitable for Bohemian\r\nrevels,' I said. 'I am lunching with an artist bloke on the other side\r\nof the river.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And if anybody calls for me, Jeeves, say that I shall be back towards\r\nthe quiet evenfall.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Mr Biffen rang up on the telephone while you were in your\r\nbath.'\r\n\r\n'Mr Biffen? Good heavens!'\r\n\r\nAmazing how one's always running across fellows in foreign\r\ncities--coves, I mean, whom you haven't seen for ages and would have\r\nbetted weren't anywhere in the neighbourhood. Paris was the last place\r\nwhere I should have expected to find old Biffy popping up. There was\r\na time when he and I had been lads about town together, lunching and\r\ndining together practically every day; but some eighteen months back\r\nhis old godmother had died and left him that place in Herefordshire,\r\nand he had retired there to wear gaiters and prod cows in the ribs and\r\ngenerally be the country gentleman and landed proprietor. Since then I\r\nhad hardly seen him.\r\n\r\n'Old Biffy in Paris? What's he doing here?'\r\n\r\n'He did not confide in me, sir,' said Jeeves--a trifle frostily, I\r\nthought. It sounded somehow as if he didn't like Biffy. And yet they\r\nhad always been matey enough in the old days.\r\n\r\n'Where's he staying?'\r\n\r\n'At the Hotel Avenida, Rue du Colisée, sir. He informed me that he was\r\nabout to take a walk and would call this afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'Well, if he comes when I'm out, tell him to wait. And now, Jeeves,\r\n_mes gants, mon chapeau, et le whangee de monsieur_. I must be popping.'\r\n\r\nIt was such a corking day and I had so much time in hand that near the\r\nSorbonne I stopped my cab, deciding to walk the rest of the way. And\r\nI had hardly gone three steps and a half when there on the pavement\r\nbefore me stood old Biffy in person. If I had completed the last step I\r\nshould have rammed him.\r\n\r\n'Biffy!' I cried. 'Well, well, well!'\r\n\r\nHe peered at me in a blinking kind of way, rather like one of his\r\nHerefordshire cows prodded unexpectedly while lunching.\r\n\r\n'Bertie!' he gurgled, in a devout sort of tone. 'Thank God!' He\r\nclutched my arm. 'Don't leave me, Bertie. I'm lost.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean, lost?'\r\n\r\n'I came out for a walk and suddenly discovered after a mile or two\r\nthat I didn't know where on earth I was. I've been wandering round in\r\ncircles for hours.'\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you ask the way?'\r\n\r\n'I can't speak a word of French.'\r\n\r\n'Well, why didn't you call a taxi?'\r\n\r\n'I suddenly discovered I'd left all my money at my hotel.'\r\n\r\n'You could have taken a cab and paid it when you got to the hotel.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but I suddenly discovered, dash it, that I'd forgotten its name.'\r\n\r\nAnd there in a nutshell you have Charles Edward Biffen. As vague and\r\nwoollen-headed a blighter as ever bit a sandwich. Goodness knows--and\r\nmy Aunt Agatha will bear me out in this--I'm no master-mind myself but\r\ncompared with Biffy I'm one of the great thinkers of all time.\r\n\r\n'I'd give a shilling,' said Biffy wistfully, 'to know the name of that\r\nhotel.'\r\n\r\n'You can owe it me. Hotel Avenida, Rue du Colisée.'\r\n\r\n'Bertie! This is uncanny. How the deuce did you know?'\r\n\r\n'That was the address you left with Jeeves this morning.'\r\n\r\n'So it was. I had forgotten.'\r\n\r\n'Well, come along and have a drink and then I'll put you in a cab and\r\nsend you home. I'm engaged for lunch, but I've plenty of time.'\r\n\r\nWe drifted to one of the eleven cafés which jostled each other along\r\nthe street and I ordered restoratives.\r\n\r\n'What on earth are you doing in Paris?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Bertie, old man,' said Biffy solemnly, 'I came here to try and forget.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you've certainly succeeded.'\r\n\r\n'You don't understand. The fact is, Bertie, old lad, my heart is\r\nbroken. I'll tell you the whole story.'\r\n\r\n'No, I say!' I protested. But he was off.\r\n\r\n'Last year,' said Biffy, 'I buzzed over to Canada to do a bit of salmon\r\nfishing.'\r\n\r\nI ordered another. If this was going to be a fish-story, I needed\r\nstimulants.\r\n\r\n'On the liner going to New York I met a girl.' Biffy made a sort of\r\ncurious gulping noise not unlike a bulldog trying to swallow half a\r\ncutlet in a hurry so as to be ready for the other half. 'Bertie, old\r\nman, I can't describe her. I simply can't describe her.'\r\n\r\nThis was all to the good.\r\n\r\n'She was wonderful! We used to walk on the boat-deck after dinner. She\r\nwas on the stage. At least, sort of.'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean, sort of?'\r\n\r\n'Well, she had posed for artists and been a mannequin in a big\r\ndressmaker's and all that sort of thing, don't you know. Anyway, she\r\nhad saved up a few pounds and was on her way to see if she could get\r\na job in New York. She told me all about herself. Her father ran a\r\nmilk-walk in Clapham. Or it may have been Cricklewood. At least, it was\r\neither a milk-walk or a boot-shop.'\r\n\r\n'Easily confused.'\r\n\r\n'What I'm trying to make you understand,' said Biffy, 'is that she came\r\nof good, sturdy, respectable middle-class stock. Nothing flashy about\r\nher. The sort of wife any man might have been proud of.'\r\n\r\n'Well, whose wife was she?'\r\n\r\n'Nobody's. That's the whole point of the story. I wanted her to be\r\nmine, and I lost her.'\r\n\r\n'Had a quarrel, you mean?'\r\n\r\n'No, I don't mean we had a quarrel. I mean I literally lost her. The\r\nlast I ever saw of her was in the Customs sheds at New York. We were\r\nbehind a pile of trunks, and I had just asked her to be my wife, and\r\nshe had just said she would and everything was perfectly splendid, when\r\na most offensive blighter in a peaked cap came up to talk about some\r\ncigarettes which he had found at the bottom of my trunk and which I had\r\nforgotten to declare. It was getting pretty late by then, for we hadn't\r\ndocked till about ten-thirty, so I told Mabel to go on to her hotel and\r\nI would come round next day and take her to lunch. And since then I\r\nhaven't set eyes on her.'\r\n\r\n'You mean she wasn't at the hotel?'\r\n\r\n'Probably she was. But--'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean you never turned up?'\r\n\r\n'Bertie, old man,' said Biffy, in an overwrought kind of way, 'for\r\nHeaven's sake don't keep trying to tell me what I mean and what I don't\r\nmean! Let me tell this my own way, or I shall get all mixed up and have\r\nto go back to the beginning.'\r\n\r\n'Tell it your own way,' I said hastily.\r\n\r\n'Well, then, to put it in a word, Bertie, I forgot the name of the\r\nhotel. By the time I'd done half an hour's heavy explaining about those\r\ncigarettes my mind was a blank. I had an idea I had written the name\r\ndown somewhere, but I couldn't have done, for it wasn't on any of the\r\npapers in my pocket. No, it was no good. She was gone.'\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you make inquiries?'\r\n\r\n'Well, the fact is, Bertie, I had forgotten her name.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, dash it!' I said. This seemed a bit too thick even for Biffy.\r\n'How could you forget her name? Besides, you told it me a moment ago.\r\nMuriel or something.'\r\n\r\n'Mabel,' corrected Biffy coldly. 'It was her surname I'd forgotten. So\r\nI gave it up and went to Canada.'\r\n\r\n'But half a second,' I said. 'You must have told her your name. I mean,\r\nif you couldn't trace her, she could trace you.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. That's what makes it all seem so infernally hopeless. She\r\nknows my name and where I live and everything, but I haven't heard a\r\nword from her. I suppose, when I didn't turn up at the hotel, she took\r\nit that that was my way of hinting delicately that I had changed my\r\nmind and wanted to call the thing off.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose so,' I said. There didn't seem anything else to suppose.\r\n'Well, the only thing to do is to whizz around and try to heal the\r\nwound, what? How about dinner tonight, winding up at the Abbaye or one\r\nof those places?'\r\n\r\nBiffy shook his head.\r\n\r\n'It wouldn't be any good. I've tried it. Besides, I'm leaving on the\r\nfour o'clock train. I have a dinner engagement tomorrow with a man\r\nwho's nibbling at that house of mine in Herefordshire.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, are you trying to sell that place? I thought you liked it.'\r\n\r\n'I did. But the idea of going on living in that great, lonely barn of a\r\nhouse after what has happened appals me, Bertie. So when Sir Roderick\r\nGlossop came along--'\r\n\r\n'Sir Roderick Glossop! You don't mean the loony-doctor?'\r\n\r\n'The great nerve specialist, yes. Why, do you know him?'\r\n\r\nIt was a warm day, but I shivered.\r\n\r\n'I was engaged to his daughter for a week or two,' I said, in a hushed\r\nvoice. The memory of that narrow squeak always made me feel faint.\r\n\r\n'Has he a daughter?' said Biffy absently.\r\n\r\n'He has. Let me tell you all about--'\r\n\r\n'Not just now, old man,' said Biffy, getting up. 'I ought to be going\r\nback to my hotel to see about my packing.'\r\n\r\nWhich, after I had listened to his story, struck me as pretty low-down.\r\nHowever, the longer you live, the more you realize that the good old\r\nsporting spirit of give-and-take has practically died out in our midst.\r\nSo I boosted him into a cab and went off to lunch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt can't have been more than ten days after this that I received a\r\nnasty shock while getting outside my morning tea and toast. The English\r\npapers had arrived, and Jeeves was just drifting out of the room after\r\ndepositing _The Times_ by my bedside, when, as I idly turned the pages\r\nin search of the sporting section, a paragraph leaped out and hit me\r\nsquarely in the eyeball.\r\n\r\nAs follows:--\r\n\r\n                         FORTHCOMING MARRIAGES\r\n\r\n                   MR C. E. BIFFEN AND MISS GLOSSOP\r\n\r\n    The engagement is announced between Charles Edward, only son of\r\n    the late Mr E. C. Biffen, and Mrs Biffen, of 11 Penslow Square,\r\n    Mayfair, and Honoria Jane Louise, only daughter of Sir Roderick\r\n    and Lady Glossop, of 6b Harley Street, W.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'Sir?' said Jeeves, turning at the door.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, you remember Miss Glossop?'\r\n\r\n'Very vividly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'She's engaged to Mr Biffen!'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?' said Jeeves. And, with not another word, he slid out.\r\nThe blighter's calm amazed and shocked me. It seemed to indicate that\r\nthere must be a horrible streak of callousness in him. I mean to say,\r\nit wasn't as if he didn't know Honoria Glossop.\r\n\r\nI read the paragraph again. A peculiar feeling it gave me. I don't know\r\nif you have ever experienced the sensation of seeing the announcement\r\nof the engagement of a pal of yours to a girl whom you were only saved\r\nfrom marrying yourself by the skin of your teeth. It induces a sort\r\nof--well, it's difficult to describe it exactly; but I should imagine a\r\nfellow would feel much the same if he happened to be strolling through\r\nthe jungle with a boyhood chum and met a tigress or a jaguar, or what\r\nnot, and managed to shin up a tree and looked down and saw the friend\r\nof his youth vanishing into the undergrowth in the animal's slavering\r\njaws. A sort of profound, prayerful relief, if you know what I mean,\r\nblended at the same time with a pang of pity. What I'm driving at is\r\nthat, thankful as I was that I hadn't had to marry Honoria myself, I\r\nwas sorry to see a real good chap like old Biffy copping it. I sucked\r\ndown a spot of tea and began to brood over the business.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are probably fellows in the world--tough, hardy blokes\r\nwith strong chins and glittering eyes--who could get engaged to this\r\nGlossop menace and like it, but I knew perfectly well that Biffy was\r\nnot one of them. Honoria, you see, is one of those robust, dynamic\r\ngirls with the muscles of a welterweight and a laugh like a squadron\r\nof cavalry charging over a tin bridge. A beastly thing to have to\r\nface over the breakfast table. Brainy, moreover. The sort of girl who\r\nreduces you to pulp with sixteen sets of tennis and a few rounds of\r\ngolf and then comes down to dinner as fresh as a daisy, expecting you\r\nto take an intelligent interest in Freud. If I had been engaged to her\r\nanother week, her old father would have had one more patient on his\r\nbooks; and Biffy is much the same quiet sort of peaceful, inoffensive\r\nbird as me. I was shocked, I tell you, shocked.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I was saying, the thing that shocked me most was Jeeves's\r\nfrightful lack of proper emotion. The man happening to float in at this\r\njuncture, I gave him one more chance to show some human sympathy.\r\n\r\n'You got the name correctly, didn't you, Jeeves?' I said. 'Mr Biffen is\r\ngoing to marry Honoria Glossop, the daughter of the old boy with the\r\negg-like head and the eyebrows.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Which suit would you wish me to lay out this morning?'\r\n\r\nAnd this, mark you, from the man who, when I was engaged to the\r\nGlossop, strained every fibre in his brain to extricate me. It beat me.\r\nI couldn't understand it.\r\n\r\n'The blue with the red twill,' I said coldly. My manner was marked, and\r\nI meant him to see that he had disappointed me sorely.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later I went back to London, and scarcely had I got\r\nsettled in the old flat when Biffy blew in. One glance was enough to\r\ntell me that the poisoned wound had begun to fester. The man did not\r\nlook bright. No, there was no getting away from it, not bright. He had\r\nthat kind of stunned, glassy expression which I used to see on my own\r\nface in the shaving-mirror during my brief engagement to the Glossop\r\npestilence. However, if you don't want to be one of the What is Wrong\r\nWith This Picture brigade, you must observe the conventions, so I shook\r\nhis hand as warmly as I could.\r\n\r\n'Well, well, old man,' I said. 'Congratulations.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said Biffy wanly, and there was rather a weighty silence.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' said Biffy, after the silence had lasted about three minutes.\r\n\r\n'Hallo?'\r\n\r\n'Is it really true--?'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, nothing,' said Biffy, and conversation languished again. After\r\nabout a minute and a half he came to the surface once more.\r\n\r\n'Bertie.'\r\n\r\n'Still here, old thing. What is it?'\r\n\r\n'I say, Bertie, is it really true that you were once engaged to\r\nHonoria?'\r\n\r\n'It is.'\r\n\r\nBiffy coughed.\r\n\r\n'How did you get out--I mean, what was the nature of the tragedy that\r\nprevented the marriage?'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves worked it. He thought out the entire scheme.'\r\n\r\n'I think, before I go,' said Biffy thoughtfully, 'I'll just step into\r\nthe kitchen and have a word with Jeeves.'\r\n\r\nI felt that the situation called for complete candour.\r\n\r\n'Biffy, old egg,' I said, 'as man to man, do you want to oil out of\r\nthis thing?'\r\n\r\n'Bertie, old cork,' said Biffy earnestly, 'as one friend to another, I\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n'Then why the dickens did you ever get into it?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. Why did you?'\r\n\r\n'I--well, it sort of happened.'\r\n\r\n'And it sort of happened with me. You know how it is when your heart's\r\nbroken. A kind of lethargy comes over you. You get absent-minded and\r\ncease to exercise proper precautions, and the first thing you know\r\nyou're for it. I don't know how it happened, old man, but there it is.\r\nAnd what I want you to tell me is, what's the procedure?'\r\n\r\n'You mean, how does a fellow edge out?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, Bertie, but I can't\r\ngo through with this thing. The shot is not on the board. For about a\r\nday and a half I thought it might be all right, but now--You remember\r\nthat laugh of hers?'\r\n\r\n'I do.'\r\n\r\n'Well, there's that, and then all this business of never letting a\r\nfellow alone--improving his mind and so forth--'\r\n\r\n'I know. I know.'\r\n\r\n'Very well, then. What do you recommend? What did you mean when you\r\nsaid that Jeeves worked a scheme?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, old Sir Roderick, who's a loony-doctor and nothing\r\nbut a loony-doctor, however much you may call him a nerve specialist,\r\ndiscovered that there was a modicum of insanity in my family. Nothing\r\nserious. Just one of my uncles. Used to keep rabbits in his bedroom.\r\nAnd the old boy came to lunch here to give me the once-over, and Jeeves\r\narranged matters so that he went away firmly convinced that I was off\r\nmy onion.'\r\n\r\n'I see,' said Biffy thoughtfully. 'The trouble is there isn't any\r\ninsanity in my family.'\r\n\r\n'None?'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me almost incredible that a fellow could be such a perfect\r\nchump as dear old Biffy without a bit of assistance.\r\n\r\n'Not a loony on the list,' he said gloomily. 'It's just like my luck.\r\nThe old boy's coming to lunch with me tomorrow, no doubt to test me as\r\nhe did you. And I never felt saner in my life.'\r\n\r\nI thought for a moment. The idea of meeting Sir Roderick again gave me\r\na cold shivery feeling; but when there is a chance of helping a pal we\r\nWoosters have no thought of self.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Biffy,' I said, 'I'll tell you what. I'll roll up for that\r\nlunch. It may easily happen that when he finds you are a pal of mine he\r\nwill forbid the banns right away and no more questions asked.'\r\n\r\n'Something in that,' said Biffy, brightening. 'Awfully sporting of you,\r\nBertie.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, not at all,' I said. 'And meanwhile I'll consult Jeeves. Put the\r\nwhole thing up to him and ask his advice. He's never failed me yet.'\r\n\r\nBiffy pushed off, a good deal braced, and I went into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'I want your help once more. I've just been having a\r\npainful interview with Mr Biffen.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'It's like this,' I said, and told him the whole thing.\r\n\r\nIt was rummy, but I could feel him freezing from the start. As a rule,\r\nwhen I call Jeeves into conference on one of these little problems,\r\nhe's all sympathy and bright ideas; but not today.\r\n\r\n'I fear, sir,' he said, when I had finished, 'it is hardly my place to\r\nintervene in a private matter affecting--'\r\n\r\n'Oh come!'\r\n\r\n'No, sir. It would be taking a liberty.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, tackling the blighter squarely, 'what have you got\r\nagainst old Biffy?'\r\n\r\n'I, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you.'\r\n\r\n'I assure you, sir!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, if you don't want to chip in and save a fellow-creature, I\r\nsuppose I can't make you. But let me tell you this. I am now going back\r\nto the sitting-room, and I am going to put in some very tense thinking.\r\nYou'll look pretty silly when I come and tell you that I've got Mr\r\nBiffen out of the soup without your assistance. Extremely silly you'll\r\nlook.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Shall I bring you a whisky-and-soda, sir?'\r\n\r\n'No. Coffee! Strong and black. And if anybody wants to see me, tell 'em\r\nthat I'm busy and can't be disturbed.'\r\n\r\nAn hour later I rang the bell.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said with hauteur.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Kindly ring Mr Biffen up on the phone and say that Mr Wooster presents\r\nhis compliments and that he has got it.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was feeling more than a little pleased with myself next morning\r\nas I strolled round to Biffy's. As a rule the bright ideas you get\r\novernight have a trick of not seeming quite so frightfully fruity when\r\nyou examine them by the light of day; but this one looked as good at\r\nbreakfast as it had done before dinner. I examined it narrowly from\r\nevery angle, and I didn't see how it could fail.\r\n\r\nA few days before, my Aunt Emily's son Harold had celebrated his sixth\r\nbirthday; and, being up against the necessity of weighing in with a\r\npresent of some kind, I had happened to see in a shop in the Strand a\r\nrather sprightly little gadget, well calculated in my opinion to amuse\r\nthe child and endear him to one and all. It was a bunch of flowers in\r\na sort of holder ending in an ingenious bulb attachment which, when\r\npressed, shot about a pint and a half of pure spring water into the\r\nface of anyone who was ass enough to sniff at it. It seemed to me just\r\nthe thing to please the growing mind of a kid of six, and I had rolled\r\nround with it.\r\n\r\nBut when I got to the house I found Harold sitting in the midst of a\r\nmass of gifts so luxurious and costly that I simply hadn't the crust to\r\ncontribute a thing that had set me back a mere elevenpence-ha'penny;\r\nso with rare presence of mind--for we Woosters can think quick on\r\noccasion--I wrenched my Uncle James's card off a toy aeroplane,\r\nsubstituted my own, and trousered the squirt, which I took away with\r\nme. It had been lying around in my flat ever since, and it seemed to me\r\nthat the time had come to send it into action.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Biffy anxiously, as I curveted into his sitting-room.\r\n\r\nThe poor old bird was looking pretty green about the gills. I\r\nrecognized the symptoms. I had felt much the same myself when waiting\r\nfor Sir Roderick to turn up and lunch with me. How the deuce people\r\nwho have anything wrong with their nerves can bring themselves to chat\r\nwith that man, I can't imagine; and yet he has the largest practice in\r\nLondon. Scarcely a day passes without his having to sit on somebody's\r\nhead and ring for the attendant to bring the strait-waistcoat; and his\r\noutlook on life has become so jaundiced through constant association\r\nwith coves who are picking straws out of their hair that I was\r\nconvinced that Biffy had merely got to press the bulb and nature would\r\ndo the rest.\r\n\r\nSo I patted him on the shoulder and said: 'It's all right, old man!'\r\n\r\n'What does Jeeves suggest?' asked Biffy eagerly.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves doesn't suggest anything.'\r\n\r\n'But you said it was all right.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves isn't the only thinker in the Wooster home, my lad. I have\r\ntaken over your little problem, and I can tell you at once that I have\r\nthe situation well in hand.'\r\n\r\n'You?' said Biffy.\r\n\r\nHis tone was far from flattering. It suggested a lack of faith in my\r\nabilities, and my view was that an ounce of demonstration would be\r\nworth a ton of explanation. I shoved the bouquet at him.\r\n\r\n'Are you fond of flowers, Biffy?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'Smell these.'\r\n\r\nBiffy extended the old beak in a careworn sort of way, and I pressed\r\nthe bulb as per printed instructions on the label.\r\n\r\nI do like getting my money's-worth. Elevenpence-ha'penny the thing had\r\ncost me, and it would have been cheap at double. The advertisement on\r\nthe outside of the box had said that its effects were 'indescribably\r\nludicrous', and I can testify that it was no overstatement. Poor old\r\nBiffy leaped three feet in the air and smashed a small table.\r\n\r\n'There!' I said.\r\n\r\nThe old egg was a trifle incoherent at first, but he found words fairly\r\nsoon and began to express himself with a good deal of warmth.\r\n\r\n'Calm yourself, laddie,' I said, as he paused for breath. 'It was no\r\nmere jest to pass an idle hour. It was a demonstration. Take this,\r\nBiffy, with an old friend's blessing, refill the bulb, shove it into\r\nSir Roderick's face, press firmly, and leave the rest to him. I'll\r\nguarantee that in something under three seconds the idea will have\r\ndawned on him that you are not required in his family.'\r\n\r\nBiffy stared at me.\r\n\r\n'Are you suggesting that I squirt Sir Roderick?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely. Squirt him good. Squirt as you have never squirted before.'\r\n\r\n'But--'\r\n\r\nHe was still yammering at me in a feverish sort of way when there was a\r\nring at the front-door bell.\r\n\r\n'Good Lord!' cried Biffy, quivering like a jelly. 'There he is. Talk to\r\nhim while I go and change my shirt.'\r\n\r\nI had just time to refill the bulb and shove it beside Biffy's plate,\r\nwhen the door opened and Sir Roderick came in. I was picking up the\r\nfallen table at the moment, and he started talking brightly to my back.\r\n\r\n'Good afternoon. I trust I am not--Mr Wooster!'\r\n\r\nI'm bound to say I was not feeling entirely at my ease. There is\r\nsomething about the man that is calculated to strike terror into the\r\nstoutest heart. If ever there was a bloke at the very mention of whose\r\nname it would be excusable for people to tremble like aspens, that\r\nbloke is Sir Roderick Glossop. He has an enormous bald head, all the\r\nhair which ought to be on it seeming to have run into his eyebrows, and\r\nhis eyes go through you like a couple of Death Rays.\r\n\r\n'How are you, how are you, how are you?' I said, overcoming a slight\r\ndesire to leap backwards out of the window. 'Long time since we met,\r\nwhat?'\r\n\r\n'Nevertheless, I remember you most distinctly, Mr Wooster.'\r\n\r\n'That's fine,' I said. 'Old Biffy asked me to come and join you in\r\nmangling a bit of lunch.'\r\n\r\nHe waggled the eyebrows at me.\r\n\r\n'Are you a friend of Charles Biffen?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, rather. Been friends for years and years.'\r\n\r\nHe drew in his breath sharply, and I could see that Biffy's stock had\r\ndropped several points. His eye fell on the floor, which was strewn\r\nwith things that had tumbled off the upset table.\r\n\r\n'Have you had an accident?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Nothing serious,' I explained. 'Old Biffy had some sort of fit or\r\nseizure just now and knocked over the table.'\r\n\r\n'A fit!'\r\n\r\n'Or seizure.'\r\n\r\n'Is he subject to fits?'\r\n\r\nI was about to answer, when Biffy hurried in. He had forgotten to brush\r\nhis hair, which gave him a wild look, and saw the old boy direct a keen\r\nglance at him. It seemed to me that what you might call the preliminary\r\nspade-work had been most satisfactorily attended to and that the\r\nsuccess of the good old bulb could be in no doubt whatever.\r\n\r\nBiffy's man came in with the nose-bags and we sat down to lunch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt looked at first as though the meal was going to be one of those\r\ncomplete frosts which occur from time to time in the career of a\r\nconstant luncher-out. Biffy, a very C-3 host, contributed nothing to\r\nthe feast of reason and flow of soul beyond an occasional hiccup,\r\nand every time I started to pull a nifty, Sir Roderick swung round\r\non me with such a piercing stare that it stopped me in my tracks.\r\nFortunately, however, the second course consisted of a chicken\r\nfricassee of such outstanding excellence that the old boy, after\r\nwolfing a plateful, handed up his dinner-pail for a second instalment\r\nand became almost genial.\r\n\r\n'I am here this afternoon, Charles,' he said, with what practically\r\namounted to bonhomie, 'on what I might describe as a mission. Yes, a\r\nmission. This is most excellent chicken.'\r\n\r\n'Glad you like it,' mumbled old Biffy.\r\n\r\n'Singularly toothsome,' said Sir Roderick, pronging another half ounce.\r\n'Yes, as I was saying, a mission. You young fellows nowadays are, I\r\nknow, content to live in the centre of the most wonderful metropolis\r\nthe world has seen, blind and indifferent to its many marvels. I\r\nshould be prepared--were I a betting man, which I am not--to wager\r\na considerable sum that you have never in your life visited even so\r\nhistoric a spot as Westminster Abbey. Am I right?'\r\n\r\nBiffy gurgled something about always having meant to.\r\n\r\n'Nor the Tower of London?'\r\n\r\nNo, nor the Tower of London.\r\n\r\n'And there exists at this very moment, not twenty minutes by cab\r\nfrom Hyde Park Corner, the most supremely absorbing and educational\r\ncollection of objects, both animate and inanimate, gathered from the\r\nfour corners of the Empire, that has ever been assembled in England's\r\nhistory. I allude to the British Empire Exhibition now situated at\r\nWembley.'\r\n\r\n'A fellow told me one about Wembley yesterday,' I said, to help on\r\nthe cheery flow of conversation. 'Stop me if you've heard it before.\r\nChap goes up to deaf chap outside the exhibition and says, \"Is this\r\nWembley?\" \"Hey?\" says deaf chap. \"Is this Wembley?\" says chap. \"Hey?\"\r\nsays deaf chap. \"Is this Wembley?\" says chap. \"No, Thursday,\" says deaf\r\nchap. Ha, ha, I mean, what?'\r\n\r\nThe merry laughter froze on my lips. Sir Roderick sort of just waggled\r\nan eyebrow in my direction and I saw that it was back to the basket for\r\nBertram. I never met a man who had such a knack of making a fellow feel\r\nlike a waste-product.\r\n\r\n'Have you yet paid a visit to Wembley, Charles?' he asked. 'No?\r\nPrecisely as I suspected. Well, that is the mission on which I am here\r\nthis afternoon. Honoria wishes me to take you to Wembley. She says it\r\nwill broaden your mind, in which view I am at one with her. We will\r\nstart immediately after luncheon.'\r\n\r\nBiffy cast an imploring look at me.\r\n\r\n'You'll come too, Bertie?'\r\n\r\nThere was such agony in his eyes that I only hesitated for a second.\r\nA pal is a pal. Besides, I felt that, if only the bulb fulfilled the\r\nhigh expectations I had formed of it, the merry expedition would be\r\ncancelled in no uncertain manner.\r\n\r\n'Oh, rather,' I said.\r\n\r\n'We must not trespass on Mr Wooster's good nature,' said Sir Roderick,\r\nlooking pretty puff-faced.\r\n\r\n'Oh, that's all right,' I said. 'I've been meaning to go to the good\r\nold exhibish for a long time. I'll slip home and change my clothes and\r\npick you up here in my car.'\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Biffy seemed too relieved at the thought of not\r\nhaving to spend the afternoon alone with Sir Roderick to be capable of\r\nspeech, and Sir Roderick was registering silent disapproval. And then\r\nhe caught sight of the bouquet by Biffy's plate.\r\n\r\n'Ah, flowers,' he said. 'Sweet peas, if I am not in error. A charming\r\nplant, pleasing alike to the eye and the nose.'\r\n\r\nI caught Biffy's eye across the table. It was bulging, and a strange\r\nlight shone in it.\r\n\r\n'Are you fond of flowers, Sir Roderick?' he croaked.\r\n\r\n'Extremely.'\r\n\r\n'Smell these.'\r\n\r\nSir Roderick dipped his head and sniffed. Biffy's fingers closed\r\nslowly over the bulb. I shut my eyes and clutched the table.\r\n\r\n'Very pleasant,' I heard Sir Roderick say. 'Very pleasant indeed.'\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes, and there was Biffy leaning back in his chair with\r\na ghastly look, and the bouquet on the cloth beside him. I realized\r\nwhat had happened. In that supreme crisis of his life, with his whole\r\nhappiness depending on a mere pressure of the fingers, Biffy, the poor\r\nspineless fish, had lost his nerve. My closely reasoned scheme had gone\r\nphut.\r\n\r\nJeeves was fooling about with the geraniums in the sitting-room\r\nwindow-box when I got home.\r\n\r\n'They make a very nice display, sir,' he said, cocking a paternal eye\r\nat the things.\r\n\r\n'Don't talk to me about flowers,' I said. 'Jeeves, I know now how a\r\ngeneral feels when he plans out some great scientific movement and his\r\ntroops let him down at the eleventh hour.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I said, and told him what had happened.\r\n\r\nHe listened thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'A somewhat vacillating and changeable young gentleman, Mr Biffen,' was\r\nhis comment when I had finished. 'Would you be requiring me for the\r\nremainder of the afternoon, sir?'\r\n\r\n'No. I'm going to Wembley. I just came back to change and get the car.\r\nProduce some fairly durable garments which can stand getting squashed\r\nby the many-headed, Jeeves, and then phone to the garage.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir. The grey cheviot lounge will, I fancy, be suitable.\r\nWould it be too much if I asked you to give me a seat in the car, sir?\r\nI had thought of going to Wembley myself this afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'Eh? Oh, all right.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much, sir.'\r\n\r\nI got dressed, and we drove round to Biffy's flat. Biffy and Sir\r\nRoderick got in at the back and Jeeves climbed into the front seat next\r\nto me. Biffy looked so ill-attuned to an afternoon's pleasure that my\r\nheart bled for the blighter and I made one last attempt to appeal to\r\nJeeves's better feelings.\r\n\r\n'I must say, Jeeves,' I said, 'I'm dashed disappointed in you.'\r\n\r\n'I am sorry to hear that, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I am. Dashed disappointed. I do think you might rally round. Did\r\nyou see Mr Biffen's face?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then.'\r\n\r\n'If you will pardon my saying so, sir, Mr Biffen has surely only\r\nhimself to thank if he has entered upon matrimonial obligations which\r\ndo not please him.'\r\n\r\n'You're talking absolute rot, Jeeves. You know as well as I do that\r\nHonoria Glossop is an Act of God. You might just as well blame a fellow\r\nfor getting run over by a truck.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely yes. Besides, the poor ass wasn't in a condition to resist.\r\nHe told me all about it. He had lost the only girl he had ever loved,\r\nand you know what a man's like when that happens to him.'\r\n\r\n'How was that, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Apparently he fell in love with some girl on the boat going over to\r\nNew York, and they parted at the Customs sheds, arranging to meet next\r\nday at her hotel. Well, you know what Biffy's like. He forgets his own\r\nname half the time. He never made a note of the address, and it passed\r\nclean out of his mind. He went about in a sort of trance, and suddenly\r\nwoke up to find that he was engaged to Honoria Glossop.'\r\n\r\n'I did not know of this, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I don't suppose anybody knows of it except me. He told me when I was\r\nin Paris.'\r\n\r\n'I should have supposed it would have been feasible to make inquiries,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\n'That's what I said. But he had forgotten her name.'\r\n\r\n'That sounds remarkable, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I said that too. But it's a fact. All he remembered was that her\r\nChristian name was Mabel. Well, you can't go scouring New York for a\r\ngirl named Mabel, what?'\r\n\r\n'I appreciate the difficulty, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, there it is, then.'\r\n\r\n'I see, sir.'\r\n\r\nWe had got into a mob of vehicles outside the Exhibition by this\r\ntime, and, some tricky driving being indicated, I had to suspend the\r\nconversation. We parked ourselves eventually and went in. Jeeves\r\ndrifted away, and Sir Roderick took charge of the expedition. He headed\r\nfor the Palace of Industry, with Biffy and myself trailing behind.\r\n\r\nWell, you know, I have never been much of a lad for exhibitions. The\r\ncitizenry in the mass always rather puts me off, and after I have been\r\nshuffling along with the multitude for a quarter of an hour or so I\r\nfeel as if I were walking on hot bricks. About this particular binge,\r\ntoo, there seemed to me a lack of what you might call human interest. I\r\nmean to say, millions of people, no doubt, are so constituted that they\r\nscream with joy and excitement at the spectacle of a stuffed porcupine\r\nfish or a glass jar of seeds from Western Australia--but not Bertram.\r\nNo; if you will take the word of one who would not deceive you, not\r\nBertram. By the time we had tottered out of the Gold Coast village and\r\nwere working towards the Palace of Machinery, everything pointed to my\r\nshortly executing a quiet sneak in the direction of that rather jolly\r\nPlanters' Bar in the West Indian section. Sir Roderick had whizzed us\r\npast this at a high rate of speed, it touching no chord in him; but I\r\nhad been able to observe that there was a sprightly sportsman behind\r\nthe counter mixing things out of bottles and stirring them up with a\r\nstick in long glasses that seemed to have ice in them, and the urge\r\ncame upon me to see more of this man. I was about to drop away from\r\nthe main body and become a straggler, when something pawed at my coat\r\nsleeve. It was Biffy, and he had the air of one who has had about\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nThere are certain moments in life when words are not needed. I looked\r\nat Biffy, Biffy looked at me. A perfect understanding linked our two\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\n'?'\r\n\r\n'!'\r\n\r\nThree minutes later we had joined the Planters.\r\n\r\nI have never been in the West Indies, but I am in a position to state\r\nthat in certain of the fundamentals of life they are streets ahead\r\nof our European civilization. The man behind the counter, as kindly\r\na bloke as I ever wish to meet, seemed to guess our requirements the\r\nmoment we hove in view. Scarcely had our elbows touched the wood before\r\nhe was leaping to and fro, bringing down a new bottle with each leap.\r\nA planter, apparently, does not consider he has had a drink unless it\r\ncontains at least seven ingredients, and I'm not saying, mind you, that\r\nhe isn't right. The man behind the bar told us the things were called\r\nGreen Swizzles; and, if ever I marry and have a son, Green Swizzle\r\nWooster is the name that will go down on the register, in memory of the\r\nday his father's life was saved at Wembley.\r\n\r\nAfter the third, Biffy breathed a contented sigh.\r\n\r\n'Where do you think Sir Roderick is?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Biffy, old thing,' I replied frankly, 'I'm not worrying.'\r\n\r\n'Bertie, old bird,' said Biffy, 'nor am I.'\r\n\r\nHe sighed again, and broke a long silence by asking the man for a straw.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he said, 'I've just remembered something rather rummy. You\r\nknow Jeeves?'\r\n\r\nI said I knew Jeeves.\r\n\r\n'Well, a rather rummy incident occurred as we were going into this\r\nplace. Old Jeeves sidled up to me and said something rather rummy.\r\nYou'll never guess what it was.'\r\n\r\n'No. I don't believe I ever shall.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves said,' proceeded Biffy earnestly, 'and I am quoting his very\r\nwords--Jeeves said, \"Mr Biffen\"--addressing me, you understand--'\r\n\r\n'I understand.'\r\n\r\n'\"Mr Biffen,\" he said, \"I strongly advise you to visit the--\"'\r\n\r\n'The what?' I asked as he paused.\r\n\r\n'Bertie, old man,' said Biffy, deeply concerned, 'I've absolutely\r\nforgotten!'\r\n\r\nI stared at the man.\r\n\r\n'What I can't understand,' I said, 'is how you manage to run that\r\nHerefordshire place of yours for a day. How on earth do you remember to\r\nmilk the cows and give the pigs their dinner?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that's all right. There are divers blokes about the\r\nplaces--hirelings and menials, you know--who look after all that.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' I said. 'Well, that being so, let us have one more Green Swizzle,\r\nand then hey for the Amusement Park.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I indulged in those few rather bitter words about exhibitions, it\r\nmust be distinctly understood that I was not alluding to what you might\r\ncall the more earthy portion of these curious places. I yield to no man\r\nin my approval of those institutions where on payment of a shilling you\r\nare permitted to slide down a slippery runway sitting on a mat. I love\r\nthe Jiggle-Joggle, and I am prepared to take on all and sundry at Skee\r\nBall for money, stamps, or Brazil nuts.\r\n\r\nBut, joyous reveller as I am on these occasions, I was simply not in\r\nit with old Biffy. Whether it was the Green Swizzles or merely the\r\nrelief of being parted from Sir Roderick, I don't know, but Biffy flung\r\nhimself into the pastimes of the proletariat with a zest that was\r\nalmost frightening. I could hardly drag him away from the Whip, and as\r\nfor the Switchback, he looked like spending the rest of his life on it.\r\nI managed to remove him at last, and he was wandering through the crowd\r\nat my side with gleaming eyes, hesitating between having his fortune\r\ntold and taking a whirl at the Wheel of Joy, when he suddenly grabbed\r\nmy arm and uttered a sharp animal cry.\r\n\r\n'Bertie!'\r\n\r\n'Now what?'\r\n\r\nHe was pointing at a large sign over a building.\r\n\r\n'Look! Palace of Beauty!'\r\n\r\nI tried to choke him off. I was getting a bit weary by this time. Not\r\nso young as I was.\r\n\r\n'You don't want to go in there,' I said. 'A fellow at the club was\r\ntelling me about that. It's only a lot of girls. You don't want to see\r\na lot of girls.'\r\n\r\n'I do want to see a lot of girls,' said Biffy firmly. 'Dozens of\r\ngirls, and the more unlike Honoria they are, the better. Besides,\r\nI've suddenly remembered that that's the place Jeeves told me to be\r\nsure and visit. It all comes back to me. \"Mr Biffen,\" he said, \"I\r\nstrongly advise you to visit the Palace of Beauty.\" Now, what the man\r\nwas driving at or what his motive was, I don't know; but I ask you,\r\nBertie, is it wise, is it safe, is it judicious ever to ignore Jeeves's\r\nlightest word? We enter by the door on the left.'\r\n\r\nI don't know if you know this Palace of Beauty place? It's a sort of\r\naquarium full of the delicately nurtured instead of fishes. You go in,\r\nand there is a kind of cage with a female goggling out at you through a\r\nsheet of plate glass. She's dressed in some weird kind of costume, and\r\nover the cage is written 'Helen of Troy'. You pass on to the next, and\r\nthere's another one doing jiu-jitsu with a snake. Sub-title, Cleopatra.\r\nYou get the idea--Famous Women Through the Ages and all that. I can't\r\nsay it fascinated me to any great extent. I maintain that lovely\r\nwoman loses a lot of her charm if you have to stare at her in a tank.\r\nMoreover, it gave me a rummy sort of feeling of having wandered into\r\nthe wrong bedroom at a country house, and I was flying past at a fair\r\nrate of speed, anxious to get it over, when Biffy suddenly went off his\r\nrocker.\r\n\r\nAt least, it looked like that. He let out a piercing yell, grabbed my\r\narm with a sudden clutch that felt like the bite of a crocodile, and\r\nstood there gibbering.\r\n\r\n'Wuk!' ejaculated Biffy, or words to that general import.\r\n\r\nA large and interested crowd had gathered round. I think they thought\r\nthe girls were going to be fed or something. But Biffy paid no\r\nattention to them. He was pointing in a loony manner at one of the\r\ncages. I forget which it was, but the female inside wore a ruff, so it\r\nmay have been Queen Elizabeth or Boadicea or someone of that period.\r\nShe was rather a nice-looking girl, and she was staring at Biffy in\r\nmuch the same pop-eyed way as he was staring at her.\r\n\r\n'Mabel!' yelled Biffy, going off in my ear like a bomb.\r\n\r\nI can't say I was feeling my chirpiest. Drama is all very well, but I\r\nhate getting mixed up in it in a public spot; and I had not realized\r\nbefore how dashed public this spot was. The crowd seemed to have\r\ndoubled itself in the last five seconds, and, while most of them had\r\ntheir eye on Biffy, quite a goodish few were looking at me as if they\r\nthought I was an important principal in the scene and might be expected\r\nat any moment to give of my best in the way of wholesome entertainment\r\nfor the masses.\r\n\r\nBiffy was jumping about like a lamb in the springtime--and, what is\r\nmore, a feeble-minded lamb.\r\n\r\n'Bertie! It's her! It's she!' He looked about him wildly. 'Where the\r\ndeuce is the stage-door?' he cried. 'Where's the manager? I want to see\r\nthe house-manager immediately.'\r\n\r\nAnd then he suddenly bounded forward and began hammering on the glass\r\nwith his stick.\r\n\r\n'I say, old lad!' I began, but he shook me off.\r\n\r\nThese fellows who live in the country are apt to go in for fairly\r\nsizable clubs instead of the light canes which your well-dressed\r\nman about town considers suitable for metropolitan use; and down in\r\nHerefordshire, apparently, something in the nature of a knobkerrie is\r\n_de rigueur_. Biffy's first slosh smashed the glass all to a hash.\r\nThree more cleared the way for him to go into the cage without cutting\r\nhimself. And, before the crowd had time to realize what a wonderful\r\nbob's-worth it was getting in exchange for its entrance fee, he was\r\ninside, engaging the girl in earnest conversation. And at the same\r\nmoment two large policemen rolled up.\r\n\r\nYou can't make policemen take the romantic view. Not a tear did these\r\ntwo blighters stop to brush away. They were inside the cage and out\r\nof it and marching Biffy through the crowd before you had time to\r\nblink. I hurried after them, to do what I could in the way of soothing\r\nBiffy's last moments, and the poor old lad turned a glowing face in my\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n'Chiswick, 60873,' he bellowed in a voice charged with emotion. 'Write\r\nit down, Bertie, or I shall forget it. Chiswick, 60873. Her telephone\r\nnumber.'\r\n\r\nAnd then he disappeared, accompanied by about eleven thousand\r\nsightseers, and a voice spoke at my elbow.\r\n\r\n'Mr Wooster! What--what--what is the meaning of this?'\r\n\r\nSir Roderick, with bigger eyebrows than ever, was standing at my side.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' I said. 'Poor old Biffy's only gone off his crumpet.'\r\n\r\nHe tottered.\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'Had a sort of fit or seizure, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Another!' Sir Roderick drew a deep breath. 'And this is the man I was\r\nabout to allow my daughter to marry!' I heard him mutter.\r\n\r\nI tapped him in a kindly spirit on the shoulder. It took some doing,\r\nmark you, but I did it.\r\n\r\n'If I were you,' I said, 'I should call that off. Scratch the fixture.\r\nWash it out absolutely, is my advice.'\r\n\r\nHe gave me a nasty look.\r\n\r\n'I do not require your advice, Mr Wooster! I had already arrived\r\nindependently at the decision of which you speak. Mr Wooster, you are a\r\nfriend of this man--a fact which should in itself have been sufficient\r\nwarning to me. You will--unlike myself--be seeing him again. Kindly\r\ninform him, when you do see him, that he may consider his engagement at\r\nan end.'\r\n\r\n'Right-ho,' I said, and hurried off after the crowd. It seemed to me\r\nthat a little bailing-out might be in order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour later that I shoved my way out to where I had\r\nparked the car. Jeeves was sitting in the front seat, brooding over the\r\ncosmos. He rose courteously as I approached.\r\n\r\n'You are leaving, sir?'\r\n\r\n'I am.'\r\n\r\n'And Sir Roderick, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Not coming. I am revealing no secrets, Jeeves, when I inform you that\r\nhe and I have parted brass rags. Not on speaking terms now.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir? And Mr Biffen? Will you wait for him?'\r\n\r\n'No. He's in prison.'\r\n\r\n'Really, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. I tried to bail him out, but they decided on second thoughts to\r\ncoop him up for the night.'\r\n\r\n'What was his offence, sir?'\r\n\r\n'You remember that girl of his I was telling you about? He found her\r\nin a tank at the Palace of Beauty and went after her by the quickest\r\nroute, which was via a plate-glass window. He was then scooped up and\r\nborne off in irons by the constabulary.' I gazed sideways at him. It\r\nis difficult to bring off a penetrating glance out of the corner of\r\nyour eye, but I managed it. 'Jeeves,' I said, 'there is more in this\r\nthan the casual observer would suppose. You told Mr Biffen to go to the\r\nPalace of Beauty. Did you know the girl would be there?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nThis was most remarkable and rummy to a degree.\r\n\r\n'Dash it, do you know everything?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, sir,' said Jeeves with an indulgent smile. Humouring the young\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n'Well, how did you know that?'\r\n\r\n'I happen to be acquainted with the future Mrs Biffen, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I see. Then you knew all about that business in New York?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. And it was for that reason that I was not altogether\r\nfavourably disposed towards Mr Biffen when you were first kind enough\r\nto suggest that I might be able to offer some slight assistance.\r\nI mistakenly supposed that he had been trifling with the girl's\r\naffections, sir. But when you told me the true facts of the case I\r\nappreciated the injustice I had done to Mr Biffen and endeavoured to\r\nmake amends.'\r\n\r\n'Well, he certainly owes you a lot. He's crazy about her.'\r\n\r\n'That is very gratifying, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And she ought to be pretty grateful to you, too. Old Biffy's got\r\nfifteen thousand a year, not to mention more cows, pigs, hens, and\r\nducks than he knows what to do with. A dashed useful bird to have in\r\nany family.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me, Jeeves,' I said, 'how did you happen to know the girl in the\r\nfirst place?'\r\n\r\nJeeves looked dreamily out into the traffic.\r\n\r\n'She is my niece, sir. If I might make the suggestion, sir, I should\r\nnot jerk the steering wheel with quite such suddenness. We very nearly\r\ncollided with that omnibus.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         7--Without the Option\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence was all in. The machinery of the law had worked without a\r\nhitch. And the beak, having adjusted a pair of pince-nez which looked\r\nas though they were going to do a nose dive any moment, coughed like\r\na pained sheep and slipped us the bad news. 'The prisoner, Wooster,'\r\nhe said--and who can paint the shame and agony of Bertram at hearing\r\nhimself so described?--'will pay a fine of five pounds.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, rather!' I said. 'Absolutely! Like a shot!'\r\n\r\nI was dashed glad to get the thing settled at such a reasonable figure.\r\nI gazed across what they call the sea of faces till I picked up Jeeves,\r\nsitting at the back. Stout fellow, he had come to see the young master\r\nthrough his hour of trial.\r\n\r\n'I say, Jeeves,' I sang out, 'have you got a fiver? I'm a bit short.'\r\n\r\n'Silence!' bellowed some officious blighter.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' I said; 'just arranging the financial details. Got\r\nthe stuff, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Good egg!'\r\n\r\n'Are you a friend of the prisoner?' asked the beak.\r\n\r\n'I am in Mr Wooster's employment, Your Worship, in the capacity of\r\ngentleman's personal gentleman.'\r\n\r\n'Then pay the fine to the clerk.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, Your Worship.'\r\n\r\nThe beak gave a coldish nod in my direction, as much as to say that\r\nthey might now strike the fetters from my wrists; and having hitched up\r\nthe pince-nez once more, proceeded to hand poor old Sippy one of the\r\nnastiest looks ever seen in Bosher Street Police Court.\r\n\r\n'The case of the prisoner Leon Trotzky--which,' he said, giving\r\nSippy the eye again, 'I am strongly inclined to think an assumed and\r\nfictitious name--is more serious. He has been convicted of a wanton and\r\nviolent assault upon the police. The evidence of the officer has proved\r\nthat the prisoner struck him in the abdomen, causing severe internal\r\npain, and in other ways interfered with him in the execution of his\r\nduties. I am aware that on the night following the annual aquatic\r\ncontest between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge a certain\r\nlicence is traditionally granted by the authorities, but aggravated\r\nacts of ruffianly hooliganism like that of the prisoner Trotzky cannot\r\nbe overlooked or palliated. He will serve a sentence of thirty days in\r\nthe Second Division without the option of a fine.'\r\n\r\n'No, I say--here--hi--dash it all!' protested poor old Sippy.\r\n\r\n'Silence!' bellowed the officious blighter.\r\n\r\n'Next case,' said the beak. And that was that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe whole affair was most unfortunate. Memory is a trifle blurred; but\r\nas far as I can piece together the facts, what happened was more or\r\nless this:\r\n\r\nAbstemious cove though I am as a general thing, there is one night in\r\nthe year when, putting all other engagements aside, I am rather apt to\r\nlet myself go a bit and renew my lost youth, as it were. The night to\r\nwhich I allude is the one following the annual aquatic contest between\r\nthe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; or, putting it another\r\nway, Boat-Race Night. Then, if ever, you will see Bertram under the\r\ninfluence. And on this occasion, I freely admit, I had been doing\r\nmyself rather juicily, with the result that when I ran into old Sippy\r\nopposite the Empire I was in quite fairly bonhomous mood. This being\r\nso, it cut me to the quick to perceive that Sippy, generally the\r\nbrightest of revellers, was far from being his usual sunny self. He had\r\nthe air of a man with a secret sorrow.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he said as we strolled along towards Piccadilly Circus, 'the\r\nheart bowed down by weight of woe to weakest hope will cling.' Sippy is\r\nby way of being an author, though mainly dependent for the necessaries\r\nof life on subsidies from an old aunt who lives in the country, and\r\nhis conversation often takes a literary turn. 'But the trouble is that\r\nI have no hope to cling to, weak or otherwise. I am up against it,\r\nBertie.'\r\n\r\n'In what way, laddie?'\r\n\r\n'I've got to go tomorrow and spend three weeks with some absolutely\r\ndud--I will go further--some positively scaly friends of my Aunt Vera.\r\nShe has fixed the thing up, and may a nephew's curse blister every bulb\r\nin her garden.'\r\n\r\n'Who are these hounds of hell?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Some people named Pringle. I haven't seen them since I was ten, but I\r\nremember them at that time striking me as England's premier warts.'\r\n\r\n'Tough luck. No wonder you've lost your morale.'\r\n\r\n'The world,' said Sippy, 'is very grey. How can I shake off this awful\r\ndepression?'\r\n\r\nIt was then that I got one of those bright ideas one does get round\r\nabout 11.30 on Boat-Race Night.\r\n\r\n'What you want, old man,' I said, 'is a policeman's helmet.'\r\n\r\n'Do I, Bertie?'\r\n\r\n'If I were you, I'd just step straight across the street and get that\r\none over there.'\r\n\r\n'But there's a policeman inside it. You can see him distinctly.'\r\n\r\n'What does that matter?' I said. I simply couldn't follow his reasoning.\r\n\r\nSippy stood for a moment in thought.\r\n\r\n'I believe you're absolutely right,' he said at last. 'Funny I never\r\nthought of it before. You really recommend me to get that helmet?'\r\n\r\n'I do, indeed.'\r\n\r\n'Then I will,' said Sippy, brightening up in the most remarkable manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo there you have the posish, and you can see why, as I left the dock a\r\nfree man, remorse gnawed at my vitals. In his twenty-fifth year, with\r\nlife opening out before him and all that sort of thing, Oliver Randolph\r\nSipperley had become a jail-bird, and it was all my fault. It was I who\r\nhad dragged that fine spirit down into the mire, so to speak, and the\r\nquestion now arose, What could I do to atone?\r\n\r\nObviously the first move must be to get in touch with Sippy and see if\r\nhe had any last messages and what-not. I pushed about a bit, making\r\ninquiries, and presently found myself in a little dark room with\r\nwhitewashed walls and a wooden bench. Sippy was sitting on the bench\r\nwith his head in his hands.\r\n\r\n'How are you, old lad?' I asked in a hushed, bedside voice.\r\n\r\n'I'm a ruined man,' said Sippy, looking like a poached egg.\r\n\r\n'Oh, come,' I said, 'it's not so bad as all that. I mean to say,\r\nyou had the swift intelligence to give a false name. There won't be\r\nanything about you in the papers.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not worrying about the papers. What's bothering me is, how can I\r\ngo and spend three weeks with the Pringles, starting today, when I've\r\ngot to sit in a prison cell with a ball and chain on my ankle?'\r\n\r\n'But you said you didn't want to go.'\r\n\r\n'It isn't a question of wanting, fathead. I've got to go. If I don't\r\nmy aunt will find out where I am. And if she finds out that I am doing\r\nthirty days, without the option, in the lowest dungeon beneath the\r\ncastle moat--well, where shall I get off?'\r\n\r\nI saw his point.\r\n\r\n'This is not a thing we can settle for ourselves,' I said gravely.\r\n'We must put our trust in a higher power. Jeeves is the man we must\r\nconsult.'\r\n\r\nAnd having collected a few of the necessary data, I shook his hand,\r\npatted him on the back and tooled off home to Jeeves.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, when I had climbed outside the pick-me-up which he\r\nhad thoughtfully prepared against my coming, 'I've got something to\r\ntell you; something important; something that vitally affects one\r\nwhom you have always regarded with--one whom you have always looked\r\nupon--one whom you have--well, to cut a long story short, as I'm not\r\nfeeling quite myself--Mr Sipperley.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, Mr Souperley is in the sip.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'I mean, Mr Sipperley is in the soup.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'And all owing to me. It was I who, in a moment of mistaken kindness,\r\nwishing only to cheer him up and give him something to occupy his mind,\r\nrecommended him to pinch that policeman's helmet.'\r\n\r\n'Is that so, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Do you mind not intoning the responses, Jeeves?' I said. 'This is a\r\nmost complicated story for a man with a headache to have to tell, and\r\nif you interrupt you'll make me lose the thread. As a favour to me,\r\ntherefore, don't do it. Just nod every now and then to show that you're\r\nfollowing me.'\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes and marshalled the facts.\r\n\r\n'To start with then, Jeeves, you may or may not know that Mr Sipperley\r\nis practically dependent on his Aunt Vera.'\r\n\r\n'Would that be Miss Sipperley of the Paddock, Beckley-on-the-Moor, in\r\nYorkshire, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Don't tell me you know her!'\r\n\r\n'Not personally, sir. But I have a cousin residing in the village who\r\nhas some slight acquaintance with Miss Sipperley. He has described her\r\nto me as an imperious and quick-tempered old lady.... But I beg your\r\npardon, sir, I should have nodded.'\r\n\r\n'Quite right, you should have nodded. Yes, Jeeves, you should have\r\nnodded. But it's too late now.'\r\n\r\nI nodded myself. I hadn't had my eight hours the night before, and what\r\nyou might call a lethargy was showing a tendency to steal over me from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\n'Oh--ah--yes,' I said, giving myself a bit of a hitch up. 'Where had I\r\ngot to?'\r\n\r\n'You were saying that Mr Sipperley is practically dependent upon Miss\r\nSipperley, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Was I?'\r\n\r\n'You were, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You're perfectly right; so I was. Well, then, you can readily\r\nunderstand, Jeeves, that he has got to take jolly good care to keep in\r\nwith her. You get that?'\r\n\r\nJeeves nodded.\r\n\r\n'Now mark this closely: The other day she wrote to old Sippy, telling\r\nhim to come down and sing at her village concert. It was equivalent to\r\na royal command, if you see what I mean, so Sippy couldn't refuse in so\r\nmany words. But he had sung at her village concert once before and had\r\ngot the bird in no uncertain manner, so he wasn't playing any return\r\ndates. You follow so far, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\nJeeves nodded.\r\n\r\n'So what did he do, Jeeves? He did what seemed to him at the moment\r\na rather brainy thing. He told her that, though he would have been\r\ndelighted to sing at her village concert, by a most unfortunate chance\r\nan editor had commissioned him to write a series of articles on the\r\ncolleges of Cambridge and he was obliged to pop down there at once and\r\nwould be away for quite three weeks. All clear up to now?'\r\n\r\nJeeves inclined the coco-nut.\r\n\r\n'Whereupon, Jeeves, Miss Sipperley wrote back, saying that she quite\r\nrealized that work must come before pleasure--pleasure being her loose\r\nway of describing the act of singing songs at the Beckley-on-the-Moor\r\nconcert and getting the laugh from the local toughs; but that, if he\r\nwas going to Cambridge, he must certainly stay with her friends, the\r\nPringles, at their house just outside the town. And she dropped them a\r\nline telling them to expect him on the twenty-eighth, and they dropped\r\nanother line saying right-ho, and the thing was settled. And now Mr\r\nSipperley is in the jug, and what will be the ultimate outcome or\r\nupshot? Jeeves, it is a problem worthy of your great intellect. I rely\r\non you.'\r\n\r\n'I will do my best to justify your confidence, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Carry on, then. And meanwhile pull down the blinds and bring a couple\r\nmore cushions and heave that small chair this way so that I can put my\r\nfeet up, and then go away and brood and let me hear from you in--say, a\r\ncouple of hours, or maybe three. And if anybody calls and wants to see\r\nme, inform them that I am dead.'\r\n\r\n'Dead, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Dead. You won't be so far wrong.'\r\n\r\nIt must have been well towards evening when I woke up with a crick in\r\nmy neck but otherwise somewhat refreshed. I pressed the bell.\r\n\r\n'I looked in twice, sir,' said Jeeves, 'but on each occasion you were\r\nasleep and I did not like to disturb you.'\r\n\r\n'The right spirit, Jeeves.... Well?'\r\n\r\n'I have been giving close thought to the little problem which you\r\nindicated, sir, and I can see only one solution.'\r\n\r\n'One is enough. What do you suggest?'\r\n\r\n'That you go to Cambridge in Mr Sipperley's place, sir.'\r\n\r\nI stared at the man. Certainly I was feeling a good deal better than\r\nI had been a few hours before; but I was far from being in a fit\r\ncondition to have rot like this talked to me.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said sternly, 'pull yourself together. This is mere babble\r\nfrom the sickbed.'\r\n\r\n'I fear I can suggest no other plan of action, sir, which will\r\nextricate Mr Sipperley from his dilemma.'\r\n\r\n'But think! Reflect! Why, even I, in spite of having had a disturbed\r\nnight and a most painful morning with the minions of the law, can see\r\nthat the scheme is a loony one. To put the finger on only one leak in\r\nthe thing, it isn't me these people want to see; it's Mr Sipperley.\r\nThey don't know me from Adam.'\r\n\r\n'So much the better, sir. For what I am suggesting is that you go to\r\nCambridge, affecting actually to be Mr Sipperley.'\r\n\r\nThis was too much.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, and I'm not half sure there weren't tears in my eyes,\r\n'surely you can see for yourself that this is pure banana oil. It is\r\nnot like you to come into the presence of a sick man and gibber.'\r\n\r\n'I think the plan I have suggested would be practicable, sir. While you\r\nwere sleeping, I was able to have a few words with Mr Sipperley, and he\r\ninformed me that Professor and Mrs Pringle have not set eyes upon him\r\nsince he was a lad of ten.'\r\n\r\n'No, that's true. He told me that. But even so, they would be sure to\r\nask him questions about my aunt--or rather his aunt. Where would I be\r\nthen?'\r\n\r\n'Mr Sipperley was kind enough to give me a few facts respecting Miss\r\nSipperley, sir, which I jotted down. With these, added to what my\r\ncousin has told me of the lady's habits, I think you would be in a\r\nposition to answer any ordinary question.'\r\n\r\nThere is something dashed insidious about Jeeves. Time and again\r\nsince we first came together he has stunned me with some apparently\r\ndrivelling suggestion or scheme or ruse or plan of campaign, and after\r\nabout five minutes has convinced me that it is not only sound but\r\nfruity. It took nearly a quarter of an hour to reason me into this\r\nparticular one, it being considerably the weirdest to date; but he did\r\nit. I was holding out pretty firmly, when he suddenly clinched the\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n'I would certainly suggest, sir,' he said, 'that you left London as\r\nsoon as possible and remained hid for some little time in some retreat\r\nwhere you would not be likely to be found.'\r\n\r\n'Eh? Why?'\r\n\r\n'During the last hours Mrs Spenser has been on the telephone three\r\ntimes, sir, endeavouring to get into communication with you.'\r\n\r\n'Aunt Agatha!' I cried, paling beneath my tan.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. I gathered from her remarks that she had been reading in\r\nthe evening paper a report of this morning's proceedings in the police\r\ncourt.'\r\n\r\nI hopped from the chair like a jack rabbit of the prairie. If Aunt\r\nAgatha was out with her hatchet, a move was most certainly indicated.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'this is a time for deeds, not words. Pack--and that\r\nright speedily.'\r\n\r\n'I have packed, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Find out when there is a train for Cambridge.'\r\n\r\n'There is one in forty minutes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Call a taxi.'\r\n\r\n'A taxi is at the door, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Good!' I said. 'Then lead me to it.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Maison Pringle was quite a bit of a way out of Cambridge, a mile\r\nor two down the Trumpington Road; and when I arrived everybody was\r\ndressing for dinner. So it wasn't till I had shoved on the evening\r\nraiment and got down to the drawing-room that I met the gang.\r\n\r\n'Hullo-ullo!' I said, taking a deep breath and floating in.\r\n\r\nI tried to speak in a clear and ringing voice, but I wasn't feeling my\r\nchirpiest. It is always a nervous job for a diffident and unassuming\r\nbloke to visit a strange house for the first time; and it doesn't\r\nmake the thing any better when he goes there pretending to be another\r\nfellow. I was conscious of a rather pronounced sinking feeling, which\r\nthe appearance of the Pringles did nothing to allay.\r\n\r\nSippy had described them as England's premier warts, and it looked to\r\nme as if he might be about right. Professor Pringle was a thinnish,\r\nbaldish, dyspeptic-lookingish cove with an eye like a haddock, while\r\nMrs Pringle's aspect was that of one who had had bad news round about\r\nthe year 1900 and never really got over it. And I was just staggering\r\nunder the impact of these two when I was introduced to a couple of\r\nancient females with shawls all over them.\r\n\r\n'No doubt you remember my mother?' said Professor Pringle mournfully,\r\nindicating Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n'Oh-ah!' I said, achieving a bit of a beam.\r\n\r\n'And my aunt,' sighed the prof, as if things were getting worse and\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n'Well, well, well!' I said, shooting another beam in the direction of\r\nExhibit B.\r\n\r\n'They were saying only this morning that they remembered you,' groaned\r\nthe prof, abandoning all hope.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The whole strength of the company gazed at me like a\r\nfamily group out of one of Edgar Allan Poe's less cheery yarns, and I\r\nfelt my _joie de vivre_ dying at the roots.\r\n\r\n'I remember Oliver,' said Exhibit A. She heaved a sigh. 'He was such a\r\npretty child. What a pity! What a pity!'\r\n\r\nTactful, of course, and calculated to put the guest completely at his\r\nease.\r\n\r\n'I remember Oliver,' said Exhibit B, looking at me in much the same way\r\nas the Bosher Street beak had looked at Sippy before putting on the\r\nblack cap. 'Nasty little boy! He teased my cat.'\r\n\r\n'Aunt Jane's memory is wonderful, considering that she will be\r\neighty-seven next birthday,' whispered Mrs Pringle with mournful pride.\r\n\r\n'What did you say?' asked the Exhibit suspiciously.\r\n\r\n'I said your memory was wonderful.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' The dear old creature gave me another glare. I could see that no\r\nbeautiful friendship was to be looked for by Bertram in this quarter.\r\n'He chased my Tibby all over the garden, shooting arrows at her from a\r\nbow.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment a cat strolled out from under the sofa and made for me\r\nwith its tail up. Cats always do take to me, which made it all the\r\nsadder that I should be saddled with Sippy's criminal record. I stooped\r\nto tickle it under the ear, such being my invariable policy, and the\r\nExhibit uttered a piercing cry.\r\n\r\n'Stop him! Stop him!'\r\n\r\nShe leaped forward, moving uncommonly well for one of her years, and\r\nhaving scooped up the cat, stood eyeing me with bitter defiance, as if\r\ndaring me to start anything. Most unpleasant.\r\n\r\n'I like cats,' I said feebly.\r\n\r\nIt didn't go. The sympathy of the audience was not with me. And\r\nconversation was at what you might call a low ebb, when the door opened\r\nand a girl came in.\r\n\r\n'My daughter Heloise,' said the prof moodily, as if he hated to admit\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI turned to mitt the female, and stood there with my hand out, gaping.\r\nI can't remember when I've had such a nasty shock.\r\n\r\nI suppose everybody has had the experience of suddenly meeting\r\nsomebody who reminded them frightfully of some fearful person. I mean\r\nto say, by way of an example, once when I was golfing in Scotland I saw\r\na woman come into the hotel who was the living image of my Aunt Agatha.\r\nProbably a very decent sort, if I had only waited to see, but I didn't\r\nwait. I legged it that evening, utterly unable to stand the spectacle.\r\nAnd on another occasion I was driven out of a thoroughly festive night\r\nclub because the head waiter reminded me of my Uncle Percy.\r\n\r\nWell, Heloise Pringle, in the most ghastly way, resembled Honoria\r\nGlossop.\r\n\r\nI think I may have told you before about this Glossop scourge. She was\r\nthe daughter of Sir Roderick Glossop, the loony-doctor, and I had been\r\nengaged to her for about three weeks, much against my wishes, when the\r\nold boy most fortunately got the idea that I was off my rocker and put\r\nthe bee on the proceedings. Since then the mere thought of her had been\r\nenough to make me start out of my sleep with a loud cry. And this girl\r\nwas exactly like her.\r\n\r\n'Er--how are you?' I said.\r\n\r\n'How do you do?'\r\n\r\nHer voice put the lid on it. It might have been Honoria herself\r\ntalking. Honoria Glossop has a voice like a lion tamer making some\r\nauthoritative announcement to one of the troupe, and so had this girl.\r\nI backed away convulsively and sprang into the air as my foot stubbed\r\nitself against something squashy. A sharp yowl rent the air, followed\r\nby an indignant cry, and I turned to see Aunt Jane, on all fours,\r\ntrying to put things right with the cat, which had gone to earth under\r\nthe sofa. She gave me a look, and I could see that her worst fears had\r\nbeen realized.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture dinner was announced--not before I was ready for it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, when I got him alone that night, 'I am no faint\r\nheart, but I am inclined to think that this binge is going to prove a\r\nshade above the odds.'\r\n\r\n'You are not enjoying your visit, sir?'\r\n\r\n'I am not, Jeeves. Have you seen Miss Pringle?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, from a distance.'\r\n\r\n'The best way to see her. Did you observe her keenly?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Did she remind you of anybody?'\r\n\r\n'She appeared to me to bear a remarkable likeness to her cousin, Miss\r\nGlossop, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Her cousin! You don't mean to say she's Honoria Glossop's cousin!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Mrs Pringle was a Miss Blatherwick--the younger of two\r\nsisters, the elder of whom married Sir Roderick Glossop.'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott! That accounts for the resemblance.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And what a resemblance, Jeeves! She even talks like Miss Glossop.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir? I have not yet heard Miss Pringle speak.'\r\n\r\n'You have missed little. And what it amounts to, Jeeves, is that,\r\nthough nothing will induce me to let old Sippy down, I can see that\r\nthis visit is going to try me high. At a pinch, I could stand the\r\nprof and wife. I could even make the effort of a lifetime and bear\r\nup against Aunt Jane. But to expect a man to mix daily with the girl\r\nHeloise--and to do it, what is more, on lemonade, which is all there\r\nwas to drink at dinner--is to ask too much of him. What shall I do,\r\nJeeves?'\r\n\r\n'I think that you should avoid Miss Pringle's society as much as\r\npossible.'\r\n\r\n'The same great thought had occurred to me,' I said.\r\n\r\nIt is all very well, though, to talk airily about avoiding a female's\r\nsociety; but when you are living in the same house with her, and she\r\ndoesn't want to avoid you, it takes a bit of doing. It is a peculiar\r\nthing in life that the people you most particularly want to edge\r\naway from always seem to cluster round like a poultice. I hadn't been\r\ntwenty-four hours in the place before I perceived that I was going to\r\nsee a lot of this pestilence.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those girls you're always meeting on the stairs and\r\nin passages. I couldn't go into a room without seeing her drift in a\r\nminute later. And if I walked in the garden she was sure to leap out at\r\nme from a laurel bush or the onion bed or something. By about the tenth\r\nday I had begun to feel absolutely haunted.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'I have begun to feel absolutely haunted.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'This woman dogs me. I never seem to get a moment to myself. Old Sippy\r\nwas supposed to come here to make a study of the Cambridge colleges,\r\nand she took me round about fifty-seven this morning. This afternoon\r\nI went to sit in the garden, and she popped up through a trap and was\r\nin my midst. This evening she cornered me in the morning-room. It's\r\ngetting so that, when I have a bath, I wouldn't be a bit surprised to\r\nfind her nestling in the soap dish.'\r\n\r\n'Extremely trying, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Dashed so. Have you any remedy to suggest?'\r\n\r\n'Not at the moment, sir. Miss Pringle does appear to be distinctly\r\ninterested in you, sir. She was asking me questions this morning\r\nrespecting your mode of life in London.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nI stared at the man in horror. A ghastly thought had struck me. I\r\nquivered like an aspen.\r\n\r\nAt lunch that day a curious thing had happened. We had just finished\r\nmangling the cutlets and I was sitting back in my chair, taking a bit\r\nof an easy before being allotted my slab of boiled pudding, when,\r\nhappening to look up, I caught the girl Heloise's eye fixed on me in\r\nwhat seemed to me a rather rummy manner. I didn't think much about it\r\nat the time, because boiled pudding is a thing you have to give your\r\nundivided attention to if you want to do yourself justice; but now,\r\nrecalling the episode in the light of Jeeves's words, the full sinister\r\nmeaning of the thing seemed to come home to me.\r\n\r\nEven at the moment, something about that look had struck me as oddly\r\nfamiliar, and now I suddenly saw why. It had been the identical\r\nlook which I had observed in the eye of Honoria Glossop in the days\r\nimmediately preceding our engagement--the look of a tigress that has\r\nmarked down its prey.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, do you know what I think?'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\nI gulped slightly.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'listen attentively. I don't want to give the\r\nimpression that I consider myself one of those deadly coves who\r\nexercise an irresistible fascination over one and all and can't meet\r\na girl without wrecking her peace of mind in the first half-minute.\r\nAs a matter of fact, it's rather the other way with me, for girls on\r\nentering my presence are mostly inclined to give me the raised eyebrow\r\nand the twitching upper lip. Nobody, therefore, can say that I am a man\r\nwho's likely to take alarm unnecessarily. You admit that, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Nevertheless, Jeeves, it is a known scientific fact that there is a\r\nparticular style of female that does seem strangely attracted to the\r\nsort of fellow I am.'\r\n\r\n'Very true, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I mean to say, I know perfectly well that I've got, roughly speaking,\r\nhalf the amount of brain a normal bloke ought to possess. And when a\r\ngirl comes along who has about twice the regular allowance, she too\r\noften makes a bee line for me with the love-light in her eyes. I don't\r\nknow how to account for it, but it is so.'\r\n\r\n'It may be Nature's provision for maintaining the balance of the\r\nspecies, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Very possibly. Anyway, it has happened to me over and over again. It\r\nwas what happened in the case of Honoria Glossop. She was notoriously\r\none of the brainiest women of her year at Girton, and she just gathered\r\nme in like a bull pup swallowing a piece of steak.'\r\n\r\n'Miss Pringle, I am informed, sir, was an even more brilliant scholar\r\nthan Miss Glossop.'\r\n\r\n'Well, there you are! Jeeves, she looks at me.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'I keep meeting her on the stairs and in passages.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'She recommends me books to read, to improve my mind.'\r\n\r\n'Highly suggestive, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And at breakfast this morning, when I was eating a sausage, she\r\ntold me I shouldn't, as modern medical science held that a four-inch\r\nsausage contained as many germs as a dead rat. The maternal touch, you\r\nunderstand; fussing over my health.'\r\n\r\n'I think we may regard that, sir, as practically conclusive.'\r\n\r\nI sank into a chair, thoroughly pipped.\r\n\r\n'What's to be done, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'We must think, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You think. I haven't the machinery.'\r\n\r\n'I will most certainly devote my very best attention to the matter,\r\nsir, and will endeavour to give satisfaction.'\r\n\r\nWell, that was something. But I was ill at ease. Yes, there is no\r\ngetting away from it, Bertram was ill at ease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning we visited sixty-three more Cambridge colleges, and after\r\nlunch I said I was going to my room to lie down. After staying there\r\nfor half an hour to give the coast time to clear, I shoved a book and\r\nsmoking materials in my pocket, and climbing out of a window, shinned\r\ndown a convenient water-pipe into the garden. My objective was the\r\nsummer-house, where it seemed to me that a man might put in a quiet\r\nhour or so without interruption.\r\n\r\nIt was extremely jolly in the garden. The sun was shining, the crocuses\r\nwere all to the mustard and there wasn't a sign of Heloise Pringle\r\nanywhere. The cat was fooling about on the lawn, so I chirruped to it\r\nand it gave a low gargle and came trotting up. I had just got it in my\r\narms and was scratching it under the ear when there was a loud shriek\r\nfrom above, and there was Aunt Jane half out of the window. Dashed\r\ndisturbing.\r\n\r\n'Oh, right-ho,' I said.\r\n\r\nI dropped the cat, which galloped off into the bushes, and dismissing\r\nthe idea of bunging a brick at the aged relative, went on my way,\r\nheading for the shrubbery. Once safely hidden there, I worked round\r\ntill I got to the summer-house. And, believe me, I had hardly got my\r\nfirst cigarette nicely under way when a shadow fell on my book and\r\nthere was young Sticketh-Closer-Than-a-Brother in person.\r\n\r\n'So there you are,' she said.\r\n\r\nShe seated herself by my side, and with a sort of gruesome playfulness\r\njerked the gasper out of the holder and heaved it through the door.\r\n\r\n'You're always smoking,' she said, a lot too much like a lovingly\r\nchiding young bride for my comfort. 'I wish you wouldn't. It's so bad\r\nfor you. And you ought not to be sitting out here without your light\r\novercoat. You want someone to look after you.'\r\n\r\n'I've got Jeeves.'\r\n\r\nShe frowned a bit.\r\n\r\n'I don't like him,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Eh? Why not?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. I wish you would get rid of him.'\r\n\r\nMy flesh absolutely crept. And I'll tell you why. One of the first\r\nthings Honoria Glossop had done after we had become engaged was to tell\r\nme she didn't like Jeeves and wanted him shot out. The realization that\r\nthis girl resembled Honoria not only in body but in blackness of soul\r\nmade me go all faint.\r\n\r\n'What are you reading?'\r\n\r\nShe picked up my book and frowned again. The thing was one I had\r\nbrought down from the old flat in London, to glance at in the train--a\r\nfairly zippy effort in the detective line called _The Trail of Blood_.\r\nShe turned the pages with a nasty sneer.\r\n\r\n'I can't understand you liking nonsense of this--' She stopped\r\nsuddenly. 'Good gracious!'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?'\r\n\r\n'Do you know Bertie Wooster?'\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw that my name was scrawled right across the title page,\r\nand my heart did three back somersaults.\r\n\r\n'Oh--er--well--that is to say--well, slightly.'\r\n\r\n'He must be a perfect horror. I'm surprised that you can make a friend\r\nof him. Apart from anything else, the man is practically an imbecile.\r\nHe was engaged to my Cousin Honoria at one time, and it was broken off\r\nbecause he was next door to insane. You should hear my Uncle Roderick\r\ntalk about him!'\r\n\r\nI wasn't keen.\r\n\r\n'Do you see much of him?'\r\n\r\n'A goodish bit.'\r\n\r\n'I saw in the paper the other day that he was fined for making a\r\ndisgraceful disturbance in the street.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I saw that.'\r\n\r\nShe gazed at me in a foul, motherly way.\r\n\r\n'He can't be a good influence for you,' she said. 'I do wish you would\r\ndrop him. Will you?'\r\n\r\n'Well--' I began. And at this point old Cuthbert, the cat, having\r\npresumably found it a bit slow by himself in the bushes, wandered in\r\nwith a matey expression on his face and jumped on my lap. I welcomed\r\nhim with a good deal of cordiality. Though but a cat, he did make a\r\nsort of third at this party; and he afforded a good excuse for changing\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n'Jolly birds, cats,' I said.\r\n\r\nShe wasn't having any.\r\n\r\n'Will you drop Bertie Wooster?' she said, absolutely ignoring the cat\r\n_motif_.\r\n\r\n'It would be so difficult.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense! It only needs a little will-power. The man surely can't be\r\nso interesting a companion as all that. Uncle Roderick says he is an\r\ninvertebrate waster.'\r\n\r\nI could have mentioned a few things that I thought Uncle Roderick was,\r\nbut my lips were sealed, so to speak.\r\n\r\n'You have changed a great deal since we last met,' said the Pringle\r\ndisease reproachfully. She bent forward and began to scratch the cat\r\nunder the other ear. 'Do you remember, when we were children together,\r\nyou used to say that you would do anything for me?'\r\n\r\n'Did I?'\r\n\r\n'I remember once you cried because I was cross and wouldn't let you\r\nkiss me.'\r\n\r\nI didn't believe it at the time, and I don't believe it now. Sippy is\r\nin many ways a good deal of a chump, but surely even at the age of ten\r\nhe cannot have been such a priceless ass as that. I think the girl\r\nwas lying, but that didn't make the position of affairs any better. I\r\nedged away a couple of inches and sat staring before me, the old brow\r\nbeginning to get slightly bedewed.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly--well, you know how it is, I mean. I suppose everyone\r\nhas had that ghastly feeling at one time or another of being urged by\r\nsome overwhelming force to do some absolutely blithering act. You get\r\nit every now and then when you're in a crowded theatre, and something\r\nseems to be egging you on to shout 'Fire!' and see what happens. Or\r\nyou're talking to someone and all at once you feel, 'Now, suppose I\r\nsuddenly biffed this bird in the eye!'\r\n\r\nWell, what I'm driving at is this, at this juncture, with her shoulder\r\nsquashing against mine and her black hair tickling my nose, a perfectly\r\nloony impulse came sweeping over me to kiss her.\r\n\r\n'No, really?' I croaked.\r\n\r\n'Have you forgotten?'\r\n\r\nShe lifted the old onion and her eyes looked straight into mine. I\r\ncould feel myself skidding. I shut my eyes. And then from the doorway\r\nthere spoke the most beautiful voice I had ever heard in my life:\r\n\r\n'Give me that cat!'\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes. There was good old Aunt Jane, that queen of her sex,\r\nstanding before me, glaring at me as if I were a vivisectionist and she\r\nhad surprised me in the middle of an experiment. How this pearl among\r\nwomen had tracked me down I don't know, but there she stood, bless her\r\ndear, intelligent old soul, like the rescue party in the last reel of a\r\nmotion picture.\r\n\r\nI didn't wait. The spell was broken and I legged it. As I went, I heard\r\nthat lovely voice again.\r\n\r\n'He shot arrows at my Tibby from a bow,' said this most deserving and\r\nexcellent octogenarian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the next few days all was peace. I saw comparatively little of\r\nHeloise. I found the strategic value of that water-pipe outside my\r\nwindow beyond praise. I seldom left the house now by any other route.\r\nIt seemed to me that, if only the luck held like this, I might after\r\nall be able to stick this visit out for the full term of the sentence.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile, as they say in the movies--\r\n\r\nThe whole family appeared to be present and correct as I came down to\r\nthe drawing-room a couple of nights later. The Prof, Mrs Prof, the two\r\nExhibits and the girl Heloise were scattered about at intervals. The\r\ncat slept on the rug, the canary in its cage. There was nothing, in\r\nshort, to indicate that this was not just one of our ordinary evenings.\r\n\r\n'Well, well, well!' I said cheerily. 'Hullo-ullo-ullo!'\r\n\r\nI always like to make something in the nature of an entrance speech, it\r\nseeming to me to lend a chummy tone to the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe girl Heloise looked at me reproachfully.\r\n\r\n'Where have you been all day?' she asked.\r\n\r\n'I went to my room after lunch.'\r\n\r\n'You weren't there at five.'\r\n\r\n'No. After putting in a spell of work on the good old colleges I went\r\nfor a stroll. Fellow must have exercise if he means to keep fit.'\r\n\r\n'_Mens sana in corpore sano_,' observed the prof.\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't wonder,' I said cordially.\r\n\r\nAt this point, when everything was going as sweet as a nut and I was\r\nfeeling on top of my form, Mrs Pringle suddenly socked me on the base\r\nof the skull with a sandbag. Not actually, I don't mean. No, no. I\r\nspeak figuratively, as it were.\r\n\r\n'Roderick is very late,' she said.\r\n\r\nYou may think it strange that the sound of that name should have\r\nsloshed into my nerve centres like a half-brick. But, take it from me,\r\nto a man who has had any dealings with Sir Roderick Glossop there is\r\nonly one Roderick in the world--and that is one too many.\r\n\r\n'Roderick?' I gurgled.\r\n\r\n'My brother-in-law, Sir Roderick Glossop, comes to Cambridge tonight,'\r\nsaid the prof. 'He lectures at St Luke's tomorrow. He is coming here to\r\ndinner.'\r\n\r\nAnd while I stood there, feeling like the hero when he discovers that\r\nhe is trapped in the den of the Secret Nine, the door opened.\r\n\r\n'Sir Roderick Glossop,' announced the maid or some such person, and in\r\nhe came.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that get this old crumb so generally disliked among\r\nthe better element of the community is the fact that he has a head like\r\nthe dome of St Paul's and eyebrows that want bobbing or shingling to\r\nreduce them to anything like reasonable size. It is a nasty experience\r\nto see this bald and bushy bloke advancing on you when you haven't\r\nprepared the strategic railways in your rear.\r\n\r\nAs he came into the room I backed behind a sofa and commended my soul\r\nto God. I didn't need to have my hand read to know that trouble was\r\ncoming to me through a dark man.\r\n\r\nHe didn't spot me at first. He shook hands with the prof and wife,\r\nkissed Heloise and waggled his head at the Exhibits.\r\n\r\n'I fear I am somewhat late,' he said. 'A slight accident on the road,\r\naffecting what my chauffeur termed the--'\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw me lurking on the outskirts and gave a startled grunt,\r\nas if I hurt him a good deal internally.\r\n\r\n'This--' began the prof, waving in my direction.\r\n\r\n'I am already acquainted with Mr Wooster.'\r\n\r\n'This,' went on the prof, 'is Miss Sipperley's nephew, Oliver. You\r\nremember Miss Sipperley?'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' barked Sir Roderick. Having had so much to do\r\nwith loonies has given him a rather sharp and authoritative manner on\r\noccasion. 'This is that wretched young man, Bertram Wooster. What is\r\nall this nonsense about Olivers and Sipperleys?'\r\n\r\nThe prof was eyeing me with some natural surprise. So were the others.\r\nI beamed a bit weakly.\r\n\r\n'Well, as a matter of fact--' I said.\r\n\r\nThe prof was wrestling with the situation. You could hear his brain\r\nbuzzing.\r\n\r\n'He said he was Oliver Sipperley,' he moaned.\r\n\r\n'Come here!' bellowed Sir Roderick. 'Am I to understand that you have\r\ninflicted yourself on this household under the pretence of being the\r\nnephew of an old friend?'\r\n\r\nIt seemed a pretty accurate description of the facts.\r\n\r\n'Well--er--yes,' I said.\r\n\r\nSir Roderick shot an eye at me. It entered the body somewhere about the\r\ntop stud, roamed around inside for a bit and went out at the back.\r\n\r\n'Insane! Quite insane, as I knew from the first moment I saw him.'\r\n\r\n'What did he say?' asked Aunt Jane.\r\n\r\n'Roderick says this young man is insane,' roared the prof.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Aunt Jane, nodding. 'I thought so. He climbs down\r\nwater-pipes.'\r\n\r\n'Does what?'\r\n\r\n'I've seen him--ah, many a time!'\r\n\r\nSir Roderick snorted violently.\r\n\r\n'He ought to be under proper restraint. It is abominable that a person\r\nin his mental condition should be permitted to roam the world at large.\r\nThe next stage may quite easily be homicidal.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that, even at the expense of giving old Sippy away, I\r\nmust be cleared of this frightful charge. After all, Sippy's number was\r\nup anyway.\r\n\r\n'Let me explain,' I said. 'Sippy asked me to come here.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'He couldn't come himself, because he was jugged for biffing a cop on\r\nBoat-Race Night.'\r\n\r\nWell, it wasn't easy to make them get the hang of the story, and even\r\nwhen I'd done it it didn't seem to make them any chummier towards me.\r\nA certain coldness about expresses it, and when dinner was announced I\r\ncounted myself out and pushed off rapidly to my room. I could have done\r\nwith a bit of dinner, but the atmosphere didn't seem just right.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, having shot in and pressed the bell, 'we're sunk.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Hell's foundations are quivering and the game is up.'\r\n\r\nHe listened attentively.\r\n\r\n'The contingency was one always to have been anticipated as a\r\npossibility, sir. It only remains to take the obvious step.'\r\n\r\n'What's that?'\r\n\r\n'Go and see Miss Sipperley, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What on earth for?'\r\n\r\n'I think it would be judicious to apprise her of the facts yourself,\r\nsir, instead of allowing her to hear of them through the medium of a\r\nletter from Professor Pringle. That is to say, if you are still anxious\r\nto do all in your power to assist Mr Sipperley.'\r\n\r\n'I can't let Sippy down. If you think it's any good--'\r\n\r\n'We can but try it, sir. I have an idea, sir, that we may find Miss\r\nSipperley disposed to look leniently upon Mr Sipperley's misdemeanour.'\r\n\r\n'What makes you think that?'\r\n\r\n'It is just a feeling that I have, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, if you think it would be worth trying--How do we get there?'\r\n\r\n'The distance is about a hundred and fifty miles, sir. Our best plan\r\nwould be to hire a car.'\r\n\r\n'Get it at once,' I said.\r\n\r\nThe idea of being a hundred and fifty miles away from Heloise Pringle,\r\nnot to mention Aunt Jane and Sir Roderick Glossop, sounded about as\r\ngood to me as anything I had ever heard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Paddock, Beckley-on-the-Moor, was about a couple of parasangs\r\nfrom the village, and I set out for it next morning, after partaking\r\nof a hearty breakfast at the local inn, practically without a tremor.\r\nI suppose when a fellow has been through it as I had in the last two\r\nweeks his system becomes hardened. After all, I felt, whatever this\r\naunt of Sippy's might be like, she wasn't Sir Roderick Glossop, so I\r\nwas that much on velvet from the start.\r\n\r\nThe Paddock was one of those medium-sized houses with a goodish bit\r\nof very tidy garden and a carefully rolled gravel drive curving past\r\na shrubbery that looked as if it had just come back from the dry\r\ncleaner--the sort of house you take one look at and say to yourself,\r\n'Somebody's aunt lives there.' I pushed on up the drive, and as I\r\nturned the bend I observed in the middle distance a woman messing about\r\nby a flower-bed with a trowel in her hand. If this wasn't the female I\r\nwas after, I was very much mistaken, so I halted, cleared the throat\r\nand gave tongue.\r\n\r\n'Miss Sipperley?'\r\n\r\nShe had had her back to me, and at the sound of my voice she executed\r\na sort of leap or bound, not unlike a barefoot dancer who steps on a\r\ntin-tack half-way through the Vision of Salome. She came to earth and\r\ngoggled at me in a rather goofy manner. A large, stout female with a\r\nreddish face.\r\n\r\n'Hope I didn't startle you,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?'\r\n\r\n'My name's Wooster. I'm a pal of your nephew, Oliver.'\r\n\r\nHer breathing had become more regular.\r\n\r\n'Oh?' she said. 'When I heard your voice I thought you were someone\r\nelse.'\r\n\r\n'No, that's who I am. I came up here to tell you about Oliver.'\r\n\r\n'What about him?'\r\n\r\nI hesitated. Now that we were approaching what you might call the nub,\r\nor crux, of the situation, a good deal of my breezy confidence seemed\r\nto have slipped from me.\r\n\r\n'Well, it's rather a painful tale, I must warn you.'\r\n\r\n'Oliver isn't ill? He hasn't had an accident?'\r\n\r\nShe spoke anxiously, and I was pleased at this evidence of human\r\nfeeling. I decided to shoot the works with no more delay.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, he isn't ill,' I said; 'and as regards having accidents, it\r\ndepends on what you call an accident. He's in chokey.'\r\n\r\n'In what?'\r\n\r\n'In prison.'\r\n\r\n'In prison!'\r\n\r\n'It was entirely my fault. We were strolling along on Boat-Race Night\r\nand I advised him to pinch a policeman's helmet.'\r\n\r\n'I don't understand.'\r\n\r\n'Well, he seemed depressed, don't you know; and rightly or wrongly,\r\nI thought it might cheer him up if he stepped across the street and\r\ncollared a policeman's helmet. He thought it a good idea, too, so he\r\nstarted doing it, and the man made a fuss and Oliver sloshed him.'\r\n\r\n'Sloshed him?'\r\n\r\n'Biffed him--smote him a blow--in the stomach.'\r\n\r\n'My nephew Oliver hit a policeman in the stomach?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely in the stomach. And next morning the beak sent him to the\r\nbastille for thirty days without the option.'\r\n\r\nI was looking at her a bit anxiously all this while to see how she was\r\ntaking the thing, and at this moment her face seemed suddenly to split\r\nin half. For an instant she appeared to be all mouth, and then she\r\nwas staggering about the grass, shouting with laughter and waving the\r\ntrowel madly.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me a bit of luck for her that Sir Roderick Glossop wasn't\r\non the spot. He would have been sitting on her head and calling for the\r\nstrait-waistcoat in the first half-minute.\r\n\r\n'You aren't annoyed?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Annoyed?' She chuckled happily. 'I've never heard such a splendid\r\nthing in my life.'\r\n\r\nI was pleased and relieved. I had hoped the news wouldn't upset her too\r\nmuch, but I had never expected it to go with such a roar as this.\r\n\r\n'I'm proud of him,' she said.\r\n\r\n'That's fine.'\r\n\r\n'If every young man in England went about hitting policemen in the\r\nstomach, it would be a better country to live in.'\r\n\r\nI couldn't follow her reasoning, but everything seemed to be all right;\r\nso after a few more cheery words I said good-bye and legged it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said when I got back to the inn, 'everything's fine. But I\r\nam far from understanding why.'\r\n\r\n'What actually occurred when you met Miss Sipperley, sir?'\r\n\r\n'I told her Sippy was in the jug for assaulting the police. Upon which\r\nshe burst into hearty laughter, waved her trowel in a pleased manner\r\nand said she was proud of him.'\r\n\r\n'I think I can explain her apparently eccentric behaviour, sir. I\r\nam informed that Miss Sipperley has had a good deal of annoyance at\r\nthe hands of the local constable during the past two weeks. This has\r\ndoubtless resulted in a prejudice on her part against the force as a\r\nwhole.'\r\n\r\n'Really? How was that?'\r\n\r\n'The constable has been somewhat over-zealous in the performance of\r\nhis duties, sir. On no fewer than three occasions in the last ten days\r\nhe has served summonses upon Miss Sipperley--for exceeding the speed\r\nlimit in her car; for allowing her dog to appear in public without a\r\ncollar; and for failing to abate a smoky chimney. Being in the nature\r\nof an autocrat, if I may use the term, in the village, Miss Sipperley\r\nhas been accustomed to do these things in the past with impunity, and\r\nthe constable's unexpected zeal has made her somewhat ill-disposed\r\nto policemen as a class and consequently disposed to look upon such\r\nassaults as Mr Sipperley's in a kindly and broadminded spirit.'\r\n\r\nI saw his point.\r\n\r\n'What an amazing bit of luck, Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Where did you hear all this?'\r\n\r\n'My informant was the constable himself, sir. He is my cousin.'\r\n\r\nI gaped at the man. I saw, so to speak, all.\r\n\r\n'Good Lord, Jeeves! You didn't bribe him?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, sir. But it was his birthday last week, and I gave him a\r\nlittle present. I have always been fond of Egbert, sir.'\r\n\r\n'How much?'\r\n\r\n'A matter of five pounds, sir.'\r\n\r\nI felt in my pocket.\r\n\r\n'Here you are,' I said. 'And another fiver for luck.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'you move in a mysterious way your wonders to\r\nperform. You don't mind if I sing a bit, do you?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all, sir,' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       8--Fixing it for Freddie\r\n\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, looking in on him one afternoon on my return from the\r\nclub, 'I don't want to interrupt you.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir?'\r\n\r\n'But I would like a word with you.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\nHe had been packing a few of the Wooster necessaries in the old kitbag\r\nagainst our approaching visit to the seaside, and he now rose and stood\r\nbursting with courteous zeal.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'a somewhat disturbing situation has arisen with\r\nregard to a pal of mine.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'You know Mr Bullivant?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I slid into the Drones this morning for a bite of lunch, and\r\nfound him in a dark corner of the smoking-room looking like the last\r\nrose of summer. Naturally I was surprised. You know what a bright lad\r\nhe is as a rule. The life and soul of every gathering he attends.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Quite the little lump of fun, in fact.'\r\n\r\n'Precisely, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I made inquiries, and he told me that he had had a quarrel with\r\nthe girl he's engaged to. You knew he was engaged to Miss Elizabeth\r\nVickers?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. I recall reading the announcement in the _Morning Post_.'\r\n\r\n'Well, he isn't any longer. What the row was about he didn't say, but\r\nthe broad facts, Jeeves, are that she has scratched the fixture. She\r\nwon't let him come near her, refuses to talk on the phone, and sends\r\nback his letters unopened.'\r\n\r\n'Extremely trying, sir.'\r\n\r\n'We ought to do something, Jeeves. But what?'\r\n\r\n'It is somewhat difficult to make a suggestion, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what I'm going to do for a start is to take him down to Marvis\r\nBay with me. I know these birds who have been handed their hat by the\r\ngirl of their dreams, Jeeves. What they want is complete change of\r\nscene.'\r\n\r\n'There is much in what you say, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Change of scene is the thing. I heard of a man. Girl refused him.\r\nMan went abroad. Two months later girl wired him \"Come back, Muriel.\"\r\nMan started to write out a reply; suddenly found that he couldn't\r\nremember girl's surname; so never answered at all, and lived happily\r\never after. It may well be, Jeeves, that after Freddie Bullivant has\r\nhad a few weeks of Marvis Bay he will get completely over it.'\r\n\r\n'Very possibly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And, if not, it is quite likely that, refreshed by sea air and good\r\nsimple food, you will get a brain-wave and think up some scheme for\r\nbringing these two misguided blighters together again.'\r\n\r\n'I will do my best, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I knew it, Jeeves, I knew it. Don't forget to put in plenty of socks.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Also of tennis shirts not a few.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nI left him to his packing, and a couple of days later we started off\r\nfor Marvis Bay, where I had taken a cottage for July and August.\r\n\r\nI don't know if you know Marvis Bay? It's in Dorsetshire; and, while\r\nnot what you would call a fiercely exciting spot, has many good points.\r\nYou spend the day there bathing and sitting on the sands, and in the\r\nevening you stroll out on the shore with the mosquitoes. At nine p.m.\r\nyou rub ointment on the wounds and go to bed. It was a simple, healthy\r\nlife, and it seemed to suit poor old Freddie absolutely. Once the moon\r\nwas up and the breeze sighing in the trees, you couldn't drag him\r\nfrom that beach with ropes. He became quite a popular pet with the\r\nmosquitoes. They would hang round waiting for him to come out, and\r\nwould give a miss to perfectly good strollers just so as to be in good\r\ncondition for him.\r\n\r\nIt was during the day that I found Freddie, poor old chap, a trifle\r\nheavy as a guest. I suppose you can't blame a bloke whose heart is\r\nbroken, but it required a good deal of fortitude to bear up against\r\nthis gloom-crushed exhibit during the early days of our little holiday.\r\nWhen he wasn't chewing a pipe and scowling at the carpet, he was\r\nsitting at the piano, playing 'The Rosary' with one finger. He couldn't\r\nplay anything except 'The Rosary', and he couldn't play much of that.\r\nHowever firmly and confidently he started off, somewhere around the\r\nthird bar a fuse would blow out and he would have to start all over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHe was playing it as usual one morning when I came in from bathing: and\r\nit seemed to me that he was extracting more hideous melancholy from it\r\neven than usual. Nor had my sense deceived me.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he said in a hollow voice, skidding on the fourth crotchet\r\nfrom the left as you enter the second bar and producing a distressing\r\nsound like the death-rattle of a sand-eel, 'I've seen her!'\r\n\r\n'Seen her?' I said. 'What, Elizabeth Vickers? How do you mean, you've\r\nseen her? She isn't down here.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, she is. I suppose she's staying with relations or something. I\r\nwas down at the post office, seeing if there were any letters, and we\r\nmet in the doorway.'\r\n\r\n'What happened?'\r\n\r\n'She cut me dead.'\r\n\r\nHe started 'The Rosary' again, and stubbed his finger on a semi-quaver.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he said, 'you ought never to have brought me here. I must go\r\naway.'\r\n\r\n'Go away? Don't talk such rot. This is the best thing that could have\r\nhappened. It's a most amazing bit of luck, her being down here. This is\r\nwhere you come out strong.'\r\n\r\n'She cut me.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind. Be a sportsman. Have another dash at her.'\r\n\r\n'She looked clean through me.'\r\n\r\n'Well, don't mind that. Stick at it. Now, having got her down here,\r\nwhat you want,' I said, 'is to place her under some obligation to you.\r\nWhat you want is to get her timidly thanking you. What you want--'\r\n\r\n'What's she going to thank me timidly for?'\r\n\r\nI thought for a while. Undoubtedly he had put his finger on the nub of\r\nthe problem. For some moments I was at a loss, not to say nonplussed.\r\nThen I saw the way.\r\n\r\n'What you want,' I said, 'is to look out for a chance and save her from\r\ndrowning.'\r\n\r\n'I can't swim.'\r\n\r\nThat was Freddie Bullivant all over. A dear old chap in a thousand\r\nways, but no help to a fellow, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nHe cranked up the piano once more, and I legged it for the open.\r\n\r\nI strolled out on the beach and began to think this thing over. I would\r\nhave liked to consult Jeeves, of course, but Jeeves had disappeared for\r\nthe morning. There was no doubt that it was hopeless expecting Freddie\r\nto do anything for himself in this crisis. I'm not saying that dear old\r\nFreddie hasn't got his strong qualities. He is good at polo, and I have\r\nheard him spoken of as a coming man at snooker-pool. But apart from\r\nthis you couldn't call him a man of enterprise.\r\n\r\nWell, I was rounding some rocks, thinking pretty tensely, when I caught\r\nsight of a blue dress, and there was the girl in person. I had never\r\nmet her, but Freddie had sixteen photographs of her sprinkled round\r\nhis bedroom, and I knew I couldn't be mistaken. She was sitting on the\r\nsand, helping a small, fat child to build a castle. On a chair close\r\nby was an elderly female reading a novel. I heard the girl call her\r\n'aunt'. So, getting the reasoning faculties to work, I deduced that the\r\nfat child must be her cousin. It struck me that if Freddie had been\r\nthere he would probably have tried to work up some sentiment about the\r\nkid on the strength of it. I couldn't manage this. I don't think I ever\r\nsaw a kid who made me feel less sentimental. He was one of those round,\r\nbulging kids.\r\n\r\nAfter he had finished his castle he seemed to get bored with life and\r\nbegan to cry. The girl, who seemed to read him like a book, took him\r\noff to where a fellow was selling sweets at a stall. And I walked on.\r\n\r\nNow, those who know me, if you ask them, will tell you that I'm a\r\nchump. My Aunt Agatha would testify to this effect. So would my\r\nUncle Percy and many more of my nearest and--if you like to use the\r\nexpression--dearest. Well, I don't mind. I admit it. I _am_ a chump.\r\nBut what I do say--and I should like to lay the greatest possible\r\nstress on this--is that every now and then, just when the populace has\r\ngiven up hope that I will ever show any real human intelligence--I\r\nget what it is idle to pretend is not an inspiration. And that's what\r\nhappened now. I doubt if the idea that came to me at this juncture\r\nwould have occurred to a single one of any dozen of the largest-brained\r\nblokes in history. Napoleon might have got it, but I'll bet Darwin and\r\nShakespeare and Thomas Hardy wouldn't have thought of it in a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt came to me on my return journey. I was walking back along the\r\nshore, exercising the old bean fiercely, when I saw the fat child\r\nmeditatively smacking a jelly-fish with a spade. The girl wasn't with\r\nhim. The aunt wasn't with him. In fact, there wasn't anybody else in\r\nsight. And the solution of the whole trouble between Freddie and his\r\nElizabeth suddenly came to me in a flash.\r\n\r\nFrom what I had seen of the two, the girl was evidently fond of this\r\nkid: and, anyhow, he was her cousin, so what I said to myself was this:\r\nIf I kidnap this young heavyweight for a brief space of time: and if,\r\nwhen the girl has got frightfully anxious about where he can have got\r\nto, dear old Freddie suddenly appears leading the infant by the hand\r\nand telling a story to the effect that he found him wandering at large\r\nabout the country and practically saved his life, the girl's gratitude\r\nis bound to make her chuck hostilities and be friends again.\r\n\r\nSo I gathered up the kid and made off with him.\r\n\r\nFreddie, dear old chap, was rather slow at first in getting on to the\r\nfine points of the idea. When I appeared at the cottage, carrying\r\nthe child, and dumped him down in the sitting-room, he showed no joy\r\nwhatever. The child had started to bellow by this time, not thinking\r\nmuch of the thing, and Freddie seemed to find it rather trying.\r\n\r\n'What the devil's all this?' he asked, regarding the little visitor\r\nwith a good deal of loathing.\r\n\r\nThe kid loosed off a yell that made the windows rattle, and I saw that\r\nthis was a time for strategy. I raced to the kitchen and fetched a pot\r\nof honey. It was the right idea. The kid stopped bellowing and began to\r\nsmear his face with the stuff.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Freddie, when silence had set in.\r\n\r\nI explained the scheme. After a while it began to strike him. The\r\ncareworn look faded from his face, and for the first time since his\r\narrival at Marvis Bay he smiled almost happily.\r\n\r\n'There's something in this, Bertie.'\r\n\r\n'It's the goods.'\r\n\r\n'I think it will work,' said Freddie.\r\n\r\nAnd, disentangling the child from the honey, he led him out.\r\n\r\n'I expect Elizabeth will be on the beach somewhere,' he said.\r\n\r\nWhat you might call a quiet happiness suffused me, if that's the word I\r\nwant. I was very fond of old Freddie, and it was jolly to think that he\r\nwas shortly about to click once more. I was leaning back in a chair on\r\nthe veranda, smoking a peaceful cigarette, when down the road I saw the\r\nold boy returning, and, by George, the kid was still with him.\r\n\r\n'Hallo!' I said. 'Couldn't you find her?'\r\n\r\nI then perceived that Freddie was looking as if he had been kicked in\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I found her,' he replied, with one of those bitter, mirthless\r\nlaughs you read about.\r\n\r\n'Well, then--?'\r\n\r\nHe sank into a chair and groaned.\r\n\r\n'This isn't her cousin, you idiot,' he said. 'He's no relation at\r\nall--just a kid she met on the beach. She had never seen him before in\r\nher life.'\r\n\r\n'But she was helping him build a sand-castle.'\r\n\r\n'I don't care. He's a perfect stranger.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that, if the modern girl goes about building\r\nsand-castles with kids she has only known for five minutes and probably\r\nwithout a proper introduction at that, then all that has been written\r\nabout her is perfectly true. Brazen is the word that seems to meet the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI said as much to Freddie, but he wasn't listening.\r\n\r\n'Well, who is this ghastly child, then?' I said.\r\n\r\n'I don't know. O Lord, I've had a time! Thank goodness you will\r\nprobably spend the next few years of your life in Dartmoor for\r\nkidnapping. That's my only consolation. I'll come and jeer at you\r\nthrough the bars on visiting days.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me all, old man,' I said.\r\n\r\nHe told me all. It took him a good long time to do it, for he broke\r\noff in the middle of nearly every sentence to call me names, but I\r\ngradually gathered what had happened. The girl Elizabeth had listened\r\nlike an iceberg while he worked off the story he had prepared, and\r\nthen--well, she didn't actually call him a liar in so many words, but\r\nshe gave him to understand in a general sort of way that he was a worm\r\nand an outcast. And then he crawled off with the kid, licked to a\r\nsplinter.\r\n\r\n'And mind,' he concluded, 'this is your affair. I'm not mixed up in it\r\nat all. If you want to escape your sentence--or anyway get a portion of\r\nit remitted--you'd better go and find the child's parents and return\r\nhim before the police come for you.'\r\n\r\n'Who are his parents?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know.'\r\n\r\n'Where do they live?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know.'\r\n\r\nThe kid didn't seem to know, either. A thoroughly vapid and uninformed\r\ninfant. I got out of him the fact that he had a father, but that was as\r\nfar as he went. It didn't seem ever to have occurred to him, chatting\r\nof an evening with the old man, to ask him his name and address. So,\r\nafter a wasted ten minutes, out we went into the great world, more or\r\nless what you might call at random.\r\n\r\nI give you my word that, until I started to tramp the place with this\r\nchild, I never had a notion that it was such a difficult job restoring\r\na son to his parents. How kidnappers ever get caught is a mystery to\r\nme. I searched Marvis Bay like a bloodhound, but nobody came forward\r\nto claim the infant. You would have thought, from the lack of interest\r\nin him, that he was stopping there all by himself in a cottage of\r\nhis own. It wasn't till, by another inspiration, I thought to ask\r\nthe sweet-stall man that I got on the track. The sweet-stall man,\r\nwho seemed to have seen a lot of him, said that the child's name was\r\nKegworthy, and that his parents lived at a place called Ocean Rest.\r\n\r\nIt then remained to find Ocean Rest. And eventually, after visiting\r\nOcean View, Ocean Prospect, Ocean Breeze, Ocean Cottage, Ocean\r\nBungalow, Ocean Nook and Ocean Homestead, I trailed it down.\r\n\r\nI knocked at the door. Nobody answered. I knocked again. I could hear\r\nmovements inside, but nobody appeared. I was just going to get to work\r\nwith that knocker in such a way that it would filter through these\r\npeople's heads that I wasn't standing there just for the fun of the\r\nthing, when a voice from somewhere above shouted 'Hi!'\r\n\r\nI looked up and saw a round, pink face, with grey whiskers east and\r\nwest of it, staring down at me from an upper window.\r\n\r\n'Hi!' it shouted again. 'You can't come in.'\r\n\r\n'I don't want to come in.'\r\n\r\n'Because--Oh, is that Tootles?'\r\n\r\n'My name is not Tootles. Are you Mr Kegworthy? I've brought back your\r\nson.'\r\n\r\n'I see him. Peep-bo, Tootles, Dadda can see 'oo.'\r\n\r\nThe face disappeared with a jerk. I could hear voices. The face\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\n'Hi!'\r\n\r\nI churned the gravel madly. This blighter was giving me the pip.\r\n\r\n'Do you live here?' asked the face.\r\n\r\n'I have taken a cottage here for a few weeks.'\r\n\r\n'What's your name?'\r\n\r\n'Wooster.'\r\n\r\n'Fancy that! Do you spell it W-o-r-c-e-s-t-e-r or W-o-o-s-t-e-r?'\r\n\r\n'W-o-o--'\r\n\r\n'I ask because I once knew a Miss Wooster, spelled W-o--'\r\n\r\nI had had about enough of this spelling-bee.\r\n\r\n'Will you open the door and take this child in?'\r\n\r\n'I mustn't open the door. This Miss Wooster that I knew married a man\r\nnamed Spenser. Was she any relation?'\r\n\r\n'She is my Aunt Agatha,' I replied, and I spoke with a good deal of\r\nbitterness, trying to suggest by my manner that he was exactly the sort\r\nof man, in my opinion, who would know my Aunt Agatha.\r\n\r\nHe beamed down at me.\r\n\r\n'This is most fortunate. We were wondering what to do with Tootles.\r\nYou see, we have mumps here. My daughter Bootles has just developed\r\nmumps. Tootles must not be exposed to the risk of infection. We could\r\nnot think what to do with him. It was most fortunate, your finding the\r\ndear child. He strayed from his nurse. I would hesitate to trust him to\r\na stranger, but you are different. Any nephew of Mrs Spenser's has my\r\ncomplete confidence. You must take Tootles into your house. It will be\r\nan ideal arrangement. I have written to my brother in London to come\r\nand fetch him. He may be here in a few days.'\r\n\r\n'May!'\r\n\r\n'He is a busy man, of course; but he should certainly be here within\r\na week. Till then Tootles can stop with you. It is an excellent plan.\r\nVery much obliged to you. Your wife will like Tootles.'\r\n\r\n'I haven't got a wife!' I yelled; but the window had closed with a\r\nbang, as if the man with the whiskers had found a germ trying to escape\r\nand had headed it off just in time.\r\n\r\nI breathed a deep breath and wiped the old forehead.\r\n\r\nThe window flew up again.\r\n\r\n'Hi!'\r\n\r\nA package weighing about a ton hit me on the head and burst like a bomb.\r\n\r\n'Did you catch it?' said the face, reappearing. 'Dear me, you missed\r\nit. Never mind. You can get it at the grocer's. Ask for Bailey's\r\nGranulated Breakfast Chips. Tootles takes them for breakfast with a\r\nlittle milk. Not cream. Milk. Be sure to get Bailey's.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but--'\r\n\r\nThe face disappeared, and the window was banged down again. I lingered\r\na while, but nothing else happened, so, taking Tootles by the hand, I\r\nwalked slowly away.\r\n\r\nAnd as we turned up the road we met Freddie's Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n'Well, baby?' she said, sighting the kid. 'So daddy found you again,\r\ndid he? Your little son and I made great friends on the beach this\r\nmorning,' she said to me.\r\n\r\nThis was the limit. Coming on top of that interview with the whiskered\r\nlunatic, it so utterly unnerved me that she had nodded good-bye and was\r\nhalf-way down the road before I caught up with my breath enough to deny\r\nthe charge of being the infant's father.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hadn't expected Freddie to sing with joy when he saw me looming up\r\nwith child complete, but I did think he might have showed a little more\r\nmanly fortitude, a little more of the old British bulldog spirit. He\r\nleaped up when we came in, glared at the kid and clutched his head. He\r\ndidn't speak for a long time; but, to make up for it, when he began he\r\ndid not leave off for a long time.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he said, when he had finished the body of his remarks, 'say\r\nsomething! Heavens, man, why don't you say something?'\r\n\r\n'If you'll give me a chance, I will,' I said, and shot the bad news.\r\n\r\n'What are you going to do about it?' he asked. And it would be idle to\r\ndeny that his manner was peevish.\r\n\r\n'What can we do about it?'\r\n\r\n'We? What do you mean, we? I'm not going to spend my time taking turns\r\nas a nursemaid to this excrescence. I'm going back to London.'\r\n\r\n'Freddie!' I cried. 'Freddie, old man!' My voice shook. 'Would you\r\ndesert a pal at a time like this?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I would.'\r\n\r\n'Freddie,' I said, 'you've got to stand by me. You must. Do you realize\r\nthat this child has to be undressed, and bathed, and dressed again? You\r\nwouldn't leave me to do all that single-handed?'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves can help you.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir,' said Jeeves, who had just rolled in with lunch; 'I must,\r\nI fear, disassociate myself completely from the matter.' He spoke\r\nrespectfully but firmly. 'I have had little or no experience with\r\nchildren.'\r\n\r\n'Now's the time to start,' I urged.\r\n\r\n'No, sir,--I am sorry to say that I cannot involve myself in any way.'\r\n\r\n'Then you must stand by me, Freddie.'\r\n\r\n'I won't.'\r\n\r\n'You must. Reflect, old man! We have been pals for years. Your mother\r\nlikes me.'\r\n\r\n'No, she doesn't.'\r\n\r\n'Well, anyway, we were at school together and you owe me a tenner.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well,' he said in a resigned sort of voice.\r\n\r\n'Besides, old thing,' I said, 'I did it all for your sake, you know.'\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in a curious way, and breathed rather hard for some\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he said, 'one moment. I will stand a good deal, but I will\r\nnot stand being expected to be grateful.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking back at it, I can see that what saved me from Colney Hatch in\r\nthis crisis was my bright idea in buying up most of the contents of\r\nthe local sweet-shop. By serving out sweets to the kid practically\r\nincessantly we managed to get through the rest of that day pretty\r\nsatisfactorily. At eight o'clock he fell asleep in a chair; and, having\r\nundressed him by unbuttoning every button in sight and, where there\r\nwere no buttons, pulling till something gave, we carried him up to bed.\r\n\r\nFreddie stood looking at the pile of clothes on the floor with a sort\r\nof careworn wrinkle between his eyes, and I knew what he was thinking.\r\nTo get the kid undressed had been simple--a mere matter of muscle.\r\nBut how were we to get him into his clothes again? I stirred the heap\r\nwith my foot. There was a long linen arrangement which might have been\r\nanything. Also a strip of pink flannel which was like nothing on earth.\r\nAll most unpleasant.\r\n\r\nBut in the morning I remembered that there were children in the next\r\nbungalow but one, and I went there before breakfast and borrowed their\r\nnurse. Women are wonderful, by Jove they are! This nurse had all the\r\nspare parts assembled and in the right places in about eight minutes,\r\nand there was the kid dressed and looking fit to go to a garden party\r\nat Buckingham Palace. I showered wealth upon her, and she promised to\r\ncome in morning and evening. I sat down to breakfast almost cheerful\r\nagain. It was the first bit of silver lining that had presented itself\r\nto date.\r\n\r\n'And, after all,' I said, 'there's lots to be argued in favour of\r\nhaving a child about the place, if you know what I mean. Kind of cosy\r\nand domestic, what?'\r\n\r\nJust then the kid upset the milk over Freddie's trousers, and when he\r\nhad come back after changing he lacked sparkle.\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after breakfast that Jeeves asked if he could have a\r\nword in my ear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, though in the anguish of recent events I had rather tended to\r\nforget what had been the original idea in bringing Freddie down to\r\nthis place, I hadn't forgotten it altogether; and I'm bound to say\r\nthat, as the days went by, I had found myself a little disappointed\r\nin Jeeves. The scheme had been, if you recall, that he should refresh\r\nhimself with sea air and simple food and, having thus got his brain\r\ninto prime working order, evolve some means of bringing Freddie and his\r\nElizabeth together again.\r\n\r\nAnd what had happened? The man had eaten well and he had slept well,\r\nbut not a step did he appear to have taken towards bringing about the\r\nhappy ending. The only move that had been made in that direction had\r\nbeen made by me, alone and unaided; and, though I freely admit that it\r\nhad turned out a good deal of a bloomer, still the fact remains that I\r\nhad shown zeal and enterprise. Consequently I received him with a bit\r\nof hauteur when he blew in. Slightly cold. A trifle frosty.\r\n\r\n'Yes, Jeeves?' I said. 'You wished to speak to me?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Say on, Jeeves,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir. What I desired to say, sir, was this: I attended a\r\nperformance at the local cinema last night.'\r\n\r\nI raised the eyebrows. I was surprised at the man. With life in the\r\nhome so frightfully tense and the young master up against it to such a\r\nfearful extent, I disapproved of him coming toddling in and prattling\r\nabout his amusements.\r\n\r\n'I hope you enjoyed yourself,' I said in rather a nasty manner.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, thank you. The management was presenting a super-super-film\r\nin seven reels, dealing with life in the wilder and more feverish\r\nstrata of New York Society, featuring Bertha Blevitch, Orlando Murphy\r\nand Baby Bobbie. I found it most entertaining, sir.'\r\n\r\n'That's good,' I said. 'And if you have a nice time this morning on the\r\nsands with your spade and bucket, you will come and tell me all about\r\nit, won't you? I have so little on my mind just now that it's a treat\r\nto hear all about your happy holiday.'\r\n\r\nSatirical, if you see what I mean. Sarcastic. Almost bitter, as a\r\nmatter of fact, if you come right down to it.\r\n\r\n'The title of the film was _Tiny Hands_, sir. And the father and mother\r\nof the character played by Baby Bobbie had unfortunately drifted\r\napart--'\r\n\r\n'Too bad,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Although at heart they loved each other still, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Did they really? I'm glad you told me that.'\r\n\r\n'And so matters went on, sir, till came a day when--'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, fixing him with a dashed unpleasant eye, 'what the\r\ndickens do you think you're talking about? Do you suppose that, with\r\nthis infernal child landed on me and the peace of the home practically\r\nshattered into a million bits, I want to hear--'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon, sir. I would not have mentioned this cinema\r\nperformance were it not for the fact that it gave me an idea, sir.'\r\n\r\n'An idea!'\r\n\r\n'An idea that will, I fancy, sir, prove of value in straightening out\r\nthe matrimonial future of Mr Bullivant. To which end, if you recollect,\r\nsir, you desired me to--'\r\n\r\nI snorted with remorse.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'I wronged you.'\r\n\r\n'Not at all, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I did. I wronged you. I had a notion that you had given yourself\r\nup entirely to the pleasures of the seaside and had chucked that\r\nbusiness altogether. I might have known better. Tell me all, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\nHe bowed in a gratified manner. I beamed. And, while we didn't actually\r\nfall on each other's necks, we gave each other to understand that all\r\nwas well once more.\r\n\r\n'In this super-super-film _Tiny Hands_, sir,' said Jeeves, 'the parents\r\nof the child had, as I say, drifted apart.'\r\n\r\n'Drifted apart,' I said, nodding. 'Right! And then?'\r\n\r\n'Came a day, sir, when their little child brought them together again.'\r\n\r\n'How?'\r\n\r\n'If I remember rightly, sir, he said, \"Dadda, doesn't 'oo love mummie\r\nno more?\"'\r\n\r\n'And then?'\r\n\r\n'They exhibited a good deal of emotion. There was what I believe is\r\ntermed a cut-back, showing scenes from their courtship and early\r\nmarried life and some glimpses of Lovers Through the Ages, and the\r\npicture concluded with a close-up of the pair in an embrace, with\r\nthe child looking on with natural gratification and an organ playing\r\n\"Hearts and Flowers\" in the distance.'\r\n\r\n'Proceed, Jeeves,' I said. 'You interest me strangely. I begin to grasp\r\nthe idea. You mean--?'\r\n\r\n'I mean, sir, that, with this young gentleman on the premises, it might\r\nbe possible to arrange a _dénouement_ of a somewhat similar nature in\r\nregard to Mr Bullivant and Miss Vickers.'\r\n\r\n'Aren't you overlooking the fact that this kid is no relation of Mr\r\nBullivant or Miss Vickers?'\r\n\r\n'Even with that handicap, sir, I fancy that good results might ensue. I\r\nthink that, if it were possible to bring Mr Bullivant and Miss Vickers\r\ntogether for a short space of time in the presence of the child, sir,\r\nand if the child were to say something of a touching nature--'\r\n\r\n'I follow you absolutely, Jeeves,' I cried with enthusiasm. 'It's big.\r\nThis is the way I see it. We lay the scene in this room. Child, centre.\r\nGirl, l.c. Freddie up stage, playing the piano. No, that won't do.\r\nHe can only play a little of \"The Rosary\" with one finger, so we'll\r\nhave to cut out the soft music. But the rest's all right. Look here,'\r\nI said. 'This inkpot is Miss Vickers. This mug with \"A Present from\r\nMarvis Bay\" on it is the child. This penwiper is Mr Bullivant. Start\r\nwith dialogue leading up to child's line. Child speaks line, let us\r\nsay, \"Boofer lady, does 'oo love dadda?\" Business of outstretched\r\nhands. Hold picture for a moment. Freddie crosses l. takes girl's hand.\r\nBusiness of swallowing lump in throat. Then big speech: \"Ah, Elizabeth,\r\nhas not this misunderstanding of ours gone on too long? See! A little\r\nchild rebukes us!\" And so on. I'm just giving you the general outline.\r\nFreddie must work up his own part. And we must get a good line for the\r\nchild. \"Boofer lady, does 'oo love dadda?\" isn't definite enough. We\r\nwant something more--'\r\n\r\n'If I might make the suggestion, sir--?'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'I would advocate the words \"Kiss Freddie!\" It is short, readily\r\nmemorized, and has what I believe is technically termed the punch.'\r\n\r\n'Genius, Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much, sir.'\r\n\r\n'\"Kiss Freddie!\" it is, then. But, I say, Jeeves, how the deuce are\r\nwe to get them together in here? Miss Vickers cuts Mr Bullivant. She\r\nwouldn't come within a mile of him.'\r\n\r\n'It is awkward, sir.'\r\n\r\n'It doesn't matter. We shall have to make it an exterior set instead\r\nof an interior. We can easily corner her on the beach somewhere, when\r\nwe're ready. Meanwhile, we must get the kid word-perfect.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Right! First rehearsal for lines and business at eleven sharp tomorrow\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoor old Freddie was in such a gloomy frame of mind that I decided\r\nnot to tell him the idea till we had finished coaching the child. He\r\nwasn't in the mood to have a thing like that hanging over him. So we\r\nconcentrated on Tootles. And pretty early in the proceedings we saw\r\nthat the only way to get Tootles worked up to the spirit of the thing\r\nwas to introduce sweets of some sort as a sub-motive, so to speak.\r\n\r\n'The chief difficulty, sir,' said Jeeves, at the end of the first\r\nrehearsal, 'is, as I envisage it, to establish in the young gentleman's\r\nmind a connexion between the words we desire him to say and the\r\nrefreshment.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly,' I said. 'Once the blighter has grasped the basic fact that\r\nthese two words, clearly spoken, result automatically in chocolate\r\nnougat, we have got a success.'\r\n\r\nI've often thought how interesting it must be to be one of those\r\nanimal-trainer blokes--to stimulate the dawning intelligence and all\r\nthat. Well, this was every bit as exciting. Some days success seemed to\r\nbe staring us in the eyeball, and the kid got out the line as if he had\r\nbeen an old professional. And then he would go all to pieces again. And\r\ntime was flying.\r\n\r\n'We must hurry up, Jeeves,' I said. 'The kid's uncle may arrive any day\r\nnow and take him away.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And we have no understudy.'\r\n\r\n'Very true, sir.'\r\n\r\n'We must work! I must say this child is a bit discouraging at times. I\r\nshould have thought a deaf-mute would have learned his part by now.'\r\n\r\nI will say this for the kid, though: he was a trier. Failure didn't\r\ndamp him. Whenever there was any kind of sweet in sight he had a dash\r\nat his line, and kept saying something till he had got what he was\r\nafter. His chief fault was his uncertainty. Personally, I would have\r\nbeen prepared to risk opening in the act and was ready to start the\r\npublic performance at the first opportunity, but Jeeves said no.\r\n\r\n'I would not advocate undue haste, sir,' he said. 'As long as the young\r\ngentleman's memory refuses to act with any certainty, we are running\r\ngrave risks of failure. Today, if you recollect, sir, he said \"Kick\r\nFreddie!\" That is not a speech to win a young lady's heart, sir.'\r\n\r\n'No. And she might do it, too. You're right. We must postpone\r\nproduction.'\r\n\r\nBut, by Jove, we didn't! The curtain went up the very next afternoon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was nobody's fault--certainly not mine. It was just fate. Jeeves was\r\nout, and I was alone in the house with Freddie and the child. Freddie\r\nhad just settled down at the piano, and I was leading the kid out of\r\nthe place for a bit of exercise, when, just as we'd got on to the\r\nveranda, along came the girl Elizabeth on her way to the beach. And at\r\nthe sight of her the kid set up a matey yell, and she stopped at the\r\nfoot of the steps.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, baby,' she said. 'Good morning,' she said to me. 'May I come\r\nup?'\r\n\r\nShe didn't wait for an answer. She just hopped on to the veranda. She\r\nseemed to be that sort of girl. She started fussing over the child. And\r\nsix feet away, mind you, Freddie smiting the piano in the sitting-room.\r\nIt was a dashed disturbing situation, take it from Bertram. At any\r\nminute Freddie might take it into his head to come out on the veranda,\r\nand I hadn't even begun to rehearse him in his part.\r\n\r\nI tried to break up the scene.\r\n\r\n'We were just going down to the beach,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Yes?' said the girl. She listened for a moment. 'So you're having your\r\npiano tuned?' she said. 'My aunt has been trying to find a tuner for\r\nours. Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he\r\nhas finished here?'\r\n\r\nI mopped the brow.\r\n\r\n'Er--I shouldn't go in just now,' I said. 'Not just now, while he's\r\nworking, if you don't mind. These fellows can't bear to be disturbed\r\nwhen they're at work. It's the artistic temperament. I'll tell him\r\nlater.'\r\n\r\n'Very well. Ask him to call at Pine Bungalow. Vickers is the name....\r\nOh, he seems to have stopped. I suppose he will be out in a minute now.\r\nI'll wait.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you think--shouldn't you be getting on to the beach?' I said.\r\n\r\nShe had started talking to the kid and didn't hear. She was feeling in\r\nher bag for something.\r\n\r\n'The beach,' I babbled.\r\n\r\n'See what I've got for you, baby,' said the girl. 'I thought I might\r\nmeet you somewhere, so I bought some of your favourite sweets.'\r\n\r\nAnd, by Jove, she held up in front of the kid's bulging eyes, a chunk\r\nof toffee about the size of the Albert Memorial!\r\n\r\nThat finished it. We had just been having a long rehearsal, and the kid\r\nwas all worked up in his part. He got it right first time.\r\n\r\n'Kiss Fweddie!' he shouted.\r\n\r\nAnd the French windows opened and Freddie came out on to the veranda,\r\nfor all the world as if he had been taking a cue.\r\n\r\n'Kiss Fweddie!' shrieked the child.\r\n\r\nFreddie looked at the girl, and the girl looked at him. I looked at the\r\nground, and the kid looked at the toffee.\r\n\r\n'Kiss Fweddie!' he yelled. 'Kiss Fweddie!'\r\n\r\n'What does this mean?' said the girl, turning on me.\r\n\r\n'You'd better give it him,' I said. 'He'll go on till you do, you know.'\r\n\r\nShe gave the kid the toffee and he subsided. Freddie, poor ass, still\r\nstood there gaping, without a word.\r\n\r\n'What does it mean?' said the girl again. Her face was pink, and her\r\neyes were sparkling in the sort of way, don't you know, that makes a\r\nfellow feel as if he hadn't any bones in him, if you know what I mean.\r\nYes, Bertram felt filleted. Did you ever tread on your partner's dress\r\nat a dance--I'm speaking now of the days when women wore dresses long\r\nenough to be trodden on--and hear it rip and see her smile at you like\r\nan angel and say, '_Please_ don't apologize. It's nothing,' and then\r\nsuddenly meet her clear blue eyes and feel as if you had stepped on the\r\nteeth of a rake and had the handle jump up and hit you in the face?\r\nWell, that's how Freddie's Elizabeth looked.\r\n\r\n'_Well!_' she said, and her teeth gave a little click.\r\n\r\nI gulped. Then I said it was nothing. Then I said it was nothing much.\r\nThen I said, 'Oh, well, it was this way.' And I told her all about it.\r\nAnd all the while Idiot Freddie stood there gaping, without a word. Not\r\none solitary yip had he let out of himself from the start.\r\n\r\nAnd the girl didn't speak, either. She just stood listening.\r\n\r\nAnd then she began to laugh. I never heard a girl laugh so much. She\r\nleaned against the side of the veranda and shrieked. And all the while\r\nFreddie, the World's Champion Dumb Brick, standing there, saying\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nWell, I finished my story and sidled to the steps. I had said all I\r\nhad to say, and it seemed to me that about here the stage-direction\r\n'exit cautiously' was written in my part. I gave poor old Freddie up in\r\ndespair. If only he had said a word it might have been all right. But\r\nthere he stood speechless.\r\n\r\nJust out of sight of the house I met Jeeves, returning from his stroll.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'all is over. The thing's finished. Poor dear old\r\nFreddie has made a complete ass of himself and killed the whole show.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir? What has actually happened?'\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n'He fluffed in his lines,' I concluded. 'Just stood there saying\r\nnothing, when if ever there was a time for eloquence, this was it.\r\nHe ... Great Scott! Look!'\r\n\r\nWe had come back within view of the cottage, and there in front of it\r\nstood six children, a nurse, two loafers, another nurse, and the fellow\r\nfrom the grocer's. They were all staring. Down the road came galloping\r\nfive more children, a dog, three men and a boy, all about to stare.\r\nAnd on our porch, as unconscious of the spectators as if they had been\r\nalone in the Sahara, stood Freddie and his Elizabeth, clasped in each\r\nother's arms.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!' I said.\r\n\r\n'It would appear, sir,' said Jeeves, 'that everything has concluded\r\nmost satisfactorily, after all.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Dear old Freddie may have been fluffy in his lines,' I said, 'but\r\nhis business certainly seems to have gone with a bang.'\r\n\r\n'Very true, sir,' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    9--Clustering Round Young Bingo\r\n\r\n\r\nI blotted the last page of my manuscript and sank back, feeling more or\r\nless of a spent force. After incredible sweat of the old brow the thing\r\nseemed to be in pretty fair shape, and I was just reading it through\r\nand debating whether to bung in another paragraph at the end, when\r\nthere was a tap at the door and Jeeves appeared.\r\n\r\n'Mrs Travers, sir, on the telephone.'\r\n\r\n'Oh?' I said. Preoccupied, don't you know.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. She presents her compliments and would be glad to know what\r\nprogress you have made with the article which you are writing for her.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, can I mention men's knee-length underclothing in a woman's\r\npaper?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Then tell her it's finished.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And, Jeeves, when you're through, come back. I want you to cast your\r\neye over this effort and give it the OK.'\r\n\r\nMy Aunt Dahlia, who runs a woman's paper called _Milady's Boudoir_, had\r\nrecently backed me into a corner and made me promise to write her a\r\nfew authoritative words for her 'Husbands and Brothers' page on 'What\r\nthe Well-Dressed Man is Wearing'. I believe in encouraging aunts, when\r\ndeserving; and, as there are many worse eggs than her knocking about\r\nthe metrop, I had consented blithely. But I give you my honest word\r\nthat if I had had the foggiest notion of what I was letting myself in\r\nfor, not even a nephew's devotion would have kept me from giving her\r\nthe raspberry. A deuce of a job it had been, taxing the physique to\r\nthe utmost. I don't wonder now that all these author blokes have bald\r\nheads and faces like birds who have suffered.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, when he came back, 'you don't read a paper called\r\n_Milady's Boudoir_ by any chance, do you?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir. The periodical has not come to my notice.'\r\n\r\n'Well, spring sixpence on it next week, because this article will\r\nappear in it. Wooster on the well-dressed man, don't you know.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, indeed, Jeeves. I've rather extended myself over this little\r\nbijou. There's a bit about socks that I think you will like.'\r\n\r\nHe took the manuscript, brooded over it, and smiled a gentle, approving\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n'The sock passage is quite in the proper vein, sir,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Well expressed, what?'\r\n\r\n'Extremely, sir.'\r\n\r\nI watched him narrowly as he read on, and, as I was expecting, what\r\nyou might call the love-light suddenly died out of his eyes. I braced\r\nmyself for an unpleasant scene.\r\n\r\n'Come to the bit about soft silk shirts for evening wear?' I asked\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' said Jeeves, in a low, cold voice, as if he had been bitten\r\nin the leg by a personal friend. 'And if I may be pardoned for saying\r\nso--'\r\n\r\n'You don't like it?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir. I do not. Soft silk shirts with evening costume are not worn,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, looking the blighter diametrically in the centre of\r\nthe eyeball, 'they're dashed well going to be. I may as well tell you\r\nnow that I have ordered a dozen of those shirtings from Peabody and\r\nSimms, and it's no good looking like that, because I am jolly well\r\nadamant.'\r\n\r\n'If I might--'\r\n\r\n'No, Jeeves,' I said, raising my hand, 'argument is useless. Nobody has\r\na greater respect than I have for your judgement in socks, in ties,\r\nand--I will go farther--in spats; but when it comes to evening shirts\r\nyour nerve seems to fail you. You have no vision. You are prejudiced\r\nand reactionary. Hidebound is the word that suggests itself. It may\r\ninterest you to learn that when I was at Le Touquet the Prince of Wales\r\nbuzzed into the Casino one night with soft silk shirt complete.'\r\n\r\n'His Royal Highness, sir, may permit himself a certain licence which in\r\nyour own case--'\r\n\r\n'No, Jeeves,' I said firmly, 'it's no use. When we Woosters are\r\nadamant, we are--well, adamant, if you know what I mean.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nI could see the man was wounded, and, of course, the whole episode had\r\nbeen extremely jarring and unpleasant; but these things have to be gone\r\nthrough. Is one a serf or isn't one? That's what it all boils down to.\r\nHaving made my point, I changed the subject.\r\n\r\n'Well, that's that,' I said. 'We now approach another topic. Do you\r\nknow any housemaids, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Housemaids, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Come, come, Jeeves, you know what housemaids are.'\r\n\r\n'Are you requiring a housemaid, sir?'\r\n\r\n'No, but Mr Little is. I met him at the club a couple of days ago, and\r\nhe told me that Mrs Little is offering rich rewards to anybody who will\r\nfind her one guaranteed to go light on the china.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. The one now in office apparently runs through the _objets d'art_\r\nlike a typhoon, simoom, or sirocco. So if you know any--'\r\n\r\n'I know a great many, sir. Some intimately, others mere acquaintances.'\r\n\r\n'Well, start digging round among the old pals. And now the hat, the\r\nstick, and other necessaries. I must be getting along and handing in\r\nthis article.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe offices of _Milady's Boudoir_ were in one of those rummy streets in\r\nthe Covent Garden neighbourhood; and I had just got to the door, after\r\nwading through a deep top-dressing of old cabbages and tomatoes, when\r\nwho should come out but Mrs Little. She greeted me with the warmth due\r\nto the old family friend, in spite of the fact that I hadn't been round\r\nto the house for a goodish while.\r\n\r\n'Whatever are you doing in these parts, Bertie? I thought you never\r\ncame east of Leicester Square.'\r\n\r\n'I've come to deliver an article of sorts which my Aunt Dahlia asked\r\nme to write. She edits a species of journal up those stairs. _Milady's\r\nBoudoir_.'\r\n\r\n'What a coincidence! I have just promised to write an article for her,\r\ntoo.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you do it,' I said earnestly. 'You've simply no notion what a\r\nghastly labour--Oh, but, of course, I was forgetting. You're used to\r\nit, what?'\r\n\r\nSilly of me to have talked like that. Young Bingo Little, if you\r\nremember, had married the famous female novelist, Rosie M. Banks,\r\nauthor of some of the most pronounced and widely read tripe ever put on\r\nthe market. Naturally a mere article would be pie for her.\r\n\r\n'No, I don't think it will give me much trouble,' she said. 'Your aunt\r\nhas suggested a most delightful subject.'\r\n\r\n'That's good. By the way, I spoke to my man Jeeves about getting you a\r\nhousemaid. He knows all the hummers.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you so much. Oh, are you doing anything tomorrow night?'\r\n\r\n'Not a thing.'\r\n\r\n'Then do come and dine with us. Your aunt is coming, and hopes to bring\r\nyour uncle. I am looking forward to meeting him.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks. Delighted.'\r\n\r\nI mean it, too. The Little household may be weak on housemaids, but it\r\nis right there when it comes to cooks. Somewhere or other some time ago\r\nBingo's missus managed to dig up a Frenchman of the most extraordinary\r\nvim and skill. A most amazing Johnnie who dishes a wicked _ragout_.\r\nOld Bingo has put on at least ten pounds in weight since this fellow\r\nAnatole arrived in the home.\r\n\r\n'At eight, then.'\r\n\r\n'Right. Thanks ever so much.'\r\n\r\nShe popped off, and I went upstairs to hand in my copy, as we boys of\r\nthe Press call it. I found Aunt Dahlia immersed to the gills in papers\r\nof all descriptions.\r\n\r\nI am not much of a lad for my relatives as a general thing, but\r\nI've always been very pally with Aunt Dahlia. She married my Uncle\r\nThomas--between ourselves a bit of a squirt--the year Bluebottle won\r\nthe Cambridgeshire; and they hadn't got half way down the aisle before\r\nI was saying to myself, 'That woman is much too good for the old bird.'\r\nAunt Dahlia is a large, genial soul, the sort you see in dozens on the\r\nhunting field. As a matter of fact, until she married Uncle Thomas, she\r\nput in most of her time on horseback; but he won't live in the country,\r\nso nowadays she expends her energy on this paper of hers.\r\n\r\nShe came to the surface as I entered, and flung a cheery look at my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Bertie! I say, have you really finished that article?'\r\n\r\n'To the last comma.'\r\n\r\n'Good boy! My gosh, I'll bet it's rotten.'\r\n\r\n'On the contrary, it is extremely hot stuff, and most of it approved by\r\nJeeves, what's more. The bit about soft silk shirts got in amongst him\r\na trifle; but you can take it from me, Aunt Dahlia, that they are the\r\nlatest yodel and will be much seen at first nights and other occasions\r\nwhere Society assembles.'\r\n\r\n'Your man Jeeves,' said Aunt Dahlia, flinging the article into a basket\r\nand skewering a few loose pieces of paper on a sort of meat hook, 'is a\r\nwashout, and you can tell him I said so.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, come,' I said. 'He may not be sound on shirtings--'\r\n\r\n'I'm not referring to that. As long as a week ago I asked him to get me\r\na cook, and he hasn't found one yet.'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott! Is Jeeves a domestic employment agency? Mrs Little wants\r\nhim to find her a housemaid. I met her outside. She tells me she's\r\ndoing something for you.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, thank goodness. I'm relying on it to bump the circulation up a\r\nbit. I can't read her stuff myself, but women love it. Her name on the\r\ncover will mean a lot. And we need it.'\r\n\r\n'Paper not doing well?'\r\n\r\n'It's doing all right really, but it's got to be a slow job building up\r\na circulation.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose so.'\r\n\r\n'I can get Tom to see that in his lucid moments,' said Aunt Dahlia,\r\nskewering a few more papers. 'But just at present the poor fathead has\r\ngot one of his pessimistic spells. It's entirely due to that mechanic\r\nwho calls herself a cook. A few more of her alleged dinners, and Tom\r\nwill refuse to go on paying the printers' bills.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean that!'\r\n\r\n'I do mean it. There was what she called a _ris de veau à la\r\nfinancière_ last night which made him talk for three-quarters of an\r\nhour about good money going to waste and nothing to show for it.'\r\n\r\nI quite understood, and I was dashed sorry for her. My Uncle Thomas\r\nis a cove who made a colossal pile of money out in the East, but in\r\ndoing so put his digestion on the blink. This has made him a tricky\r\nproposition to handle. Many a time I've lunched with him and found him\r\nperfectly chirpy up to the fish, only to have him turn blue on me well\r\nbefore the cheese.\r\n\r\nWho was that lad they used to try to make me read at Oxford?\r\nShip--Shop--Schopenhauer. That's the name. A grouch of the most\r\npronounced description. Well, Uncle Thomas, when his gastric juices\r\nhave been giving him the elbow, can make Schopenhauer look like\r\nPollyanna. And the worst of it is, from Aunt Dahlia's point of view,\r\nthat on these occasions he always seems to think he's on the brink of\r\nruin and wants to start to economize.\r\n\r\n'Pretty tough,' I said. 'Well, anyway, he'll get one good dinner\r\ntomorrow night at the Littles'.'\r\n\r\n'Can you guarantee that, Bertie?' asked Aunt Dahlia earnestly. 'I\r\nsimply daren't risk unleashing him on anything at all wonky.'\r\n\r\n'They've got a marvellous cook. I haven't been round there for some\r\ntime, but unless he's lost his form of two months ago Uncle Thomas is\r\ngoing to have the treat of a lifetime.'\r\n\r\n'It'll only make it all the worse for him, coming back to our\r\nsteak-incinerator,' said Aunt Dahlia, a bit on the Schopenhauer side\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little nest where Bingo and his bride had settled themselves was\r\nup in St John's Wood; one of those rather jolly houses with a bit of\r\ngarden. When I got there on the following night, I found that I was\r\nthe last to weigh in. Aunt Dahlia was chatting with Rosie in a corner,\r\nwhile Uncle Thomas, standing by the mantelpiece with Bingo, sucked down\r\na cocktail in a frowning, suspicious sort of manner, rather like a\r\nchappie having a short snort before dining with the Borgias: as if he\r\nwere saying to himself that, even if this particular cocktail wasn't\r\npoisoned, he was bound to cop it later on.\r\n\r\nWell, I hadn't expected anything in the nature of beaming _joie de\r\nvivre_ from Uncle Thomas, so I didn't pay much attention to him. What\r\ndid surprise me was the extraordinary gloom of young Bingo. You may say\r\nwhat you like against Bingo, but nobody has ever found him a depressing\r\nhost. Why, many a time in the days of his bachelorhood I've known him\r\nto start throwing bread before the soup course. Yet now he and Uncle\r\nThomas were a pair. He looked haggard and careworn, like a Borgia who\r\nhas suddenly remembered that he has forgotten to shove cyanide in the\r\n_consommé_, and the dinner gong due any moment.\r\n\r\nAnd the mystery wasn't helped at all by the one remark he made to me\r\nbefore conversation became general. As he poured out my cocktail, he\r\nsuddenly bent forward.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he whispered, in a nasty, feverish manner, 'I want to see\r\nyou. Life and death matter. Be in tomorrow morning.'\r\n\r\nThat was all. Immediately after that the starting-gun went and we\r\ntoddled down to the festive. And from that moment, I'm bound to say,\r\nin the superior interests of the proceedings he rather faded out of\r\nmy mind. For good old Anatole, braced presumably by the fact of there\r\nbeing guests, had absolutely surpassed himself.\r\n\r\nI am not a man who speaks hastily in these matters. I weigh my words.\r\nAnd I say again that Anatole had surpassed himself. It was as good a\r\ndinner as I have ever absorbed, and it revived Uncle Thomas like a\r\nwatered flower. As we sat down he was saying some things about the\r\nGovernment which they wouldn't have cared to hear. With the _consommé\r\npâté d'Italie_ he said but what could you expect nowadays? With the\r\n_paupiettes de sole à la princesse_ he admitted rather decently that\r\nthe Government couldn't be held responsible for the rotten weather,\r\nanyway. And shortly after the _caneton Aylesbury à la broche_ he was\r\npractically giving the lads the benefit of his whole-hearted support.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time young Bingo looking like an owl with a secret sorrow.\r\nRummy!\r\n\r\nI thought about it a good deal as I walked home, and I was hoping he\r\nwouldn't roll round with his hard-luck story too early in the morning.\r\nHe had the air of one who intends to charge in at about six-thirty.\r\n\r\nJeeves was waiting up for me when I got back.\r\n\r\n'A pleasant dinner, sir?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Magnificent, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'I am glad to hear that, sir. Mr George Travers rang up on the\r\ntelephone shortly after you had left. He was extremely desirous that\r\nyou should join him at Harrogate, sir. He leaves for that town by an\r\nearly train tomorrow.'\r\n\r\nMy Uncle George is a festive old bird who has made a habit for years\r\nof doing himself a dashed sight too well, with the result that he's\r\nalways got Harrogate or Buxton hanging over him like the sword of\r\nwhat's-his-name. And he hates going there alone.\r\n\r\n'It can't be done,' I said. Uncle George is bad enough in London, and\r\nI wasn't going to let myself be cooped up with him in one of these\r\ncure-places.\r\n\r\n'He was extremely urgent, sir.'\r\n\r\n'No, Jeeves,' I said firmly. 'I am always anxious to oblige, but Uncle\r\nGeorge--no, no! I mean to say, what?'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir,' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to hear the way he said it. Docile the man was\r\nbecoming, absolutely docile. It just showed that I had been right in\r\nputting my foot down about those shirts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Bingo showed up next morning I had had breakfast and was all ready\r\nfor him. Jeeves shot him into the presence, and he sat down on the bed.\r\n\r\n'Good morning, Bertie,' said young Bingo.\r\n\r\n'Good morning, old thing,' I replied courteously.\r\n\r\n'Don't go, Jeeves,' said young Bingo hollowly. 'Wait.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Remain. Stay. Cluster round. I shall need you.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nBingo lit a cigarette and frowned bleakly at the wallpaper.\r\n\r\n'Bertie,' he said, 'the most frightful calamity has occurred. Unless\r\nsomething is done, and done right speedily, my social prestige is\r\ndoomed, my self-respect will be obliterated, my name will be mud, and I\r\nshall not dare to show my face in the West End of London again.'\r\n\r\n'My aunt!' I cried, deeply impressed.\r\n\r\n'Exactly,' said young Bingo, with a hollow laugh. 'You have put it in a\r\nnutshell. The whole trouble is due to your blasted aunt.'\r\n\r\n'Which blasted aunt? Specify, old thing. I have so many.'\r\n\r\n'Mrs Travers. The one who runs that infernal paper.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, dash it, old man,' I protested. 'She's the only decent aunt\r\nI've got. Jeeves, you will bear me out in this?'\r\n\r\n'Such has always been my impression, I must confess, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, get rid of it, then,' said young Bingo. 'The woman is a menace\r\nto society, a home-wrecker, and a pest. Do you know what's she's done?\r\nShe's got Rosie to write an article for that rag of hers.'\r\n\r\n'I know that.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but you don't know what it's about.'\r\n\r\n'No. She only told me Aunt Dahlia had given her a splendid idea for the\r\nthing.'\r\n\r\n'It's about me!'\r\n\r\n'You?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, me! Me! And do you know what it's called? It is called \"How I\r\nKeep the Love of My Husband-Baby\".'\r\n\r\n'My what?'\r\n\r\n'Husband-baby!'\r\n\r\n'What's a husband-baby?'\r\n\r\n'I am, apparently,' said young Bingo, with much bitterness. 'I am also,\r\naccording to this article, a lot of other things which I have too\r\nmuch sense of decency to repeat even to an old friend. This beastly\r\ncomposition, in short, is one of those things they call \"human interest\r\nstories\"; one of those intimate revelations of married life over which\r\nthe female public loves to gloat; all about Rosie and me and what\r\nshe does when I come home cross, and so on. I tell you, Bertie, I am\r\nstill blushing all over at the recollection of something she says in\r\nparagraph two.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'I decline to tell you. But you can take it from me that it's the edge.\r\nNobody could be fonder of Rosie than I am, but--dear, sensible girl as\r\nshe is in ordinary life--the moment she gets in front of a dictating\r\nmachine she becomes absolutely maudlin. Bertie, that article must not\r\nappear!'\r\n\r\n'But--'\r\n\r\n'If it does I shall have to resign from my clubs, grow a beard, and\r\nbecome a hermit. I shall not be able to face the world.'\r\n\r\n'Aren't you pitching it a bit strong, old lad?' I said. 'Jeeves, don't\r\nyou think he's pitching it a bit strong?'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir--'\r\n\r\n'I am pitching it feebly,' said young Bingo earnestly. 'You haven't\r\nheard the thing. I have. Rosie shoved the cylinder on the dictating\r\nmachine last night before dinner, and it was grisly to hear the\r\ninstrument croaking out those awful sentences. If that article appears\r\nI shall be kidded to death by every pal I've got. Bertie,' he said, his\r\nvoice sinking to a hoarse whisper, 'you have about as much imagination\r\nas a warthog, but surely even you can picture to yourself what Jimmy\r\nBowles and Tuppy Rogers, to name only two, will say when they see me\r\nreferred to in print as \"half god, half prattling, mischievous child\"?'\r\n\r\nI jolly well could.\r\n\r\n'She doesn't say that?' I gasped.\r\n\r\n'She certainly does. And when I tell you that I selected that\r\nparticular quotation because it's about the only one I can stand\r\nhearing spoken, you will realize what I'm up against.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI picked at the coverlet. I had been a pal of Bingo's for many years,\r\nand we Woosters stand by our pals.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'you have heard?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'The position is serious.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'We must cluster round.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Does anything suggest itself to you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What! You don't really mean that?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Bingo,' I said, 'the sun is still shining. Something suggests itself\r\nto Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' said young Bingo in a quivering voice, 'if you see me through\r\nthis fearful crisis, ask of me what you will even unto half my kingdom.'\r\n\r\n'The matter,' said Jeeves, 'fits in very nicely, sir, with another\r\nmission which was entrusted to me this morning.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Mrs Travers rang me up on the telephone shortly before I brought you\r\nyour tea, sir, and was most urgent that I should endeavour to persuade\r\nMr Little's cook to leave Mr Little's service and join her staff. It\r\nappears that Mr Travers was fascinated by the man's ability, sir, and\r\ntalked far into the night of his astonishing gifts.'\r\n\r\nYoung Bingo uttered a frightful cry of agony.\r\n\r\n'What! Is that--that buzzard trying to pinch our cook?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'After eating our bread and salt, dammit?'\r\n\r\n'I fear, sir,' sighed Jeeves, 'that when it comes to a matter of cooks,\r\nladies have but a rudimentary sense of morality.'\r\n\r\n'Half a second, Bingo,' I said, as the fellow seemed about to plunge\r\ninto something of an oration. 'How does this fit in with the other\r\nthing, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir, it has been my experience that no lady can ever forgive\r\nanother lady for taking a really good cook away from her. I am\r\nconvinced that, if I am able to accomplish the mission which Mrs\r\nTravers entrusted to me, an instant breach of cordial relations must\r\ninevitably ensue. Mrs Little will, I feel certain, be so aggrieved with\r\nMrs Travers that she will decline to contribute to her paper. We shall\r\ntherefore not only bring happiness to Mr Travers, but also suppress\r\nthe article. Thus killing two birds with one stone, if I may use the\r\nexpression, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly you may use the expression, Jeeves,' I said cordially. 'And\r\nI may add that in my opinion this is one of your best and ripest.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but I say, you know,' bleated young Bingo. 'I mean to say--old\r\nAnatole, I mean--what I'm driving at is that he's a cook in a million.'\r\n\r\n'You poor chump, if he wasn't there would be no point in the scheme.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but what I mean--I shall miss him, you know. Miss him fearfully.'\r\n\r\n'Good heavens!' I cried. 'Don't tell me that you are thinking of your\r\ntummy in a crisis like this?'\r\n\r\nBingo sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' he said. 'I suppose it's a case of the surgeon's\r\nknife. All right, Jeeves, you may carry on. Yes, carry on, Jeeves. Yes,\r\nyes, Jeeves, carry on. I'll look in tomorrow morning and hear what you\r\nhave to report.'\r\n\r\nAnd with bowed head young Bingo biffed off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was bright and early next morning. In fact, he turned up at such an\r\nindecent hour that Jeeves very properly refused to allow him to break\r\nin on my slumbers.\r\n\r\nBy the time I was awake and receiving, he and Jeeves had had a\r\nheart-to-heart chat in the kitchen; and when Bingo eventually crept\r\ninto my room I could see by the look on his face that something had\r\ngone wrong.\r\n\r\n'It's all off,' he said, slumping down on the bed.\r\n\r\n'Off?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; that cook-pinching business. Jeeves tells me he saw Anatole last\r\nnight, and Anatole refused to leave.'\r\n\r\n'But surely Aunt Dahlia had the sense to offer him more than he was\r\ngetting with you?'\r\n\r\n'The sky was the limit, as far as she was concerned. Nevertheless, he\r\nrefused to skid. It seems he's in love with our parlourmaid.'\r\n\r\n'But you haven't got a parlourmaid.'\r\n\r\n'We have got a parlourmaid.'\r\n\r\n'I've never seen her. A sort of bloke who looked like a provincial\r\nundertaker waited at table the night before last.'\r\n\r\n'That was the local greengrocer, who comes to help out when desired.\r\nThe parlourmaid is away on her holiday--or was till last night. She\r\nreturned about ten minutes before Jeeves made his call, and Anatole, I\r\ntake it, was in such a state of elation and devotion and what-not on\r\nseeing her again that the contents of the Mint wouldn't have bribed him\r\nto part from her.'\r\n\r\n'But look here, Bingo,' I said, 'this is all rot. I see the solution\r\nright off. I'm surprised that a bloke of Jeeves's mentality overlooked\r\nit. Aunt Dahlia must engage the parlourmaid as well as Anatole. Then\r\nthey won't be parted.'\r\n\r\n'I thought of that, too. Naturally.'\r\n\r\n'I bet you didn't.'\r\n\r\n'I certainly did.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what's wrong with the scheme?'\r\n\r\n'It can't be worked. If your aunt engaged our parlourmaid she would\r\nhave to sack her own, wouldn't she?'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'Well, if she sacks her parlourmaid, it will mean that the chauffeur\r\nwill quit. He's in love with her.'\r\n\r\n'With my aunt?'\r\n\r\n'No, with the parlourmaid. And apparently he's the only chauffeur your\r\nuncle has ever found who drives carefully enough for him.'\r\n\r\nI gave it up. I had never imagined before that life below stairs was so\r\nfrightfully mixed up with what these coves call the sex complex. The\r\npersonnel of domestic staffs seemed to pair off like characters in a\r\nmusical comedy.\r\n\r\n'Oh!' I said. 'Well, that being so, we do seem to be more or less\r\nstymied. That article will have to appear after all, what?'\r\n\r\n'No, it won't.'\r\n\r\n'Has Jeeves thought of another scheme?'\r\n\r\n'No, but I have.' Bingo bent forward and patted my knee affectionately.\r\n'Look here, Bertie,' he said, 'you and I were at school together.\r\nYou'll admit that?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but--'\r\n\r\n'And you're a fellow who never lets a pal down. That's well known,\r\nisn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but listen--'\r\n\r\n'You'll cluster round. Of course you will. As if,' said Bingo with a\r\nscornful laugh, 'I ever doubted it! You won't let an old school-friend\r\ndown in his hour of need. Not you. Not Bertie Wooster. No, no!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but just one moment. What is this scheme of yours?'\r\n\r\nBingo massaged my shoulder soothingly.\r\n\r\n'It's something right in your line, Bertie, old man; something that'll\r\ncome as easy as pie to you. As a matter of fact, you've done very much\r\nthe same thing before--that time you were telling me about when you\r\npinched your uncle's Memoirs at Easeby. I suddenly remembered that, and\r\nit gave me the idea. It's--'\r\n\r\n'Here! Listen!'\r\n\r\n'It's all settled, Bertie. Nothing for you to worry about. Nothing\r\nwhatever. I see now that we made a big mistake in ever trying to tackle\r\nthis job in Jeeves's silly, roundabout way. Much better to charge\r\nstraight ahead without any of that finesse and fooling about. And so--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but listen--'\r\n\r\n'And so this afternoon I'm going to take Rosie to a matinee. I shall\r\nleave the window of her study open, and when we have got well away you\r\nwill climb in, pinch the cylinder and pop off again. It's absurdly\r\nsimple--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but half a second--'\r\n\r\n'I know what you are going to say,' said Bingo, raising his hand. 'How\r\nare you to find the cylinder? That's what is bothering you, isn't it?\r\nWell, it will be quite easy. Not a chance of a mistake. The thing is\r\nin the top left-hand drawer of the desk, and the drawer will be left\r\nunlocked because Rosie's stenographer is to come round at four o'clock\r\nand type the article.'\r\n\r\n'Now listen, Bingo,' I said. 'I'm frightfully sorry for you and all\r\nthat, but I must firmly draw the line at burglary.'\r\n\r\n'But, dash it, I'm only asking you to do what you did at Easeby.'\r\n\r\n'No, you aren't. I was staying at Easeby. It was simply a case of\r\nhaving to lift a parcel off the hall table. I hadn't got to break into\r\na house. I'm sorry but I simply will not break into your beastly house\r\non any consideration whatever.'\r\n\r\nHe gazed at me, astonished and hurt. 'Is this Bertie Wooster speaking?'\r\nhe said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is!'\r\n\r\n'But, Bertie,' he said gently, 'we agreed that you were at school with\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'I don't care.'\r\n\r\n'At school, Bertie. The dear old school.'\r\n\r\n'I don't care. I will not--'\r\n\r\n'Bertie!'\r\n\r\n'I will not--'\r\n\r\n'Bertie!'\r\n\r\n'No!'\r\n\r\n'Bertie!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' I said.\r\n\r\n'There,' said young Bingo, patting me on the shoulder, 'spoke the true\r\nBertram Wooster!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI don't know if it has ever occurred to you, but to the thoughtful cove\r\nthere is something dashed reassuring in all the reports of burglaries\r\nyou read in the papers. I mean, if you're keen on Great Britain\r\nmaintaining her prestige and all that. I mean, there can't be much\r\nwrong with the morale of a country whose sons go in to such a large\r\nextent for housebreaking, because you can take it from me that the job\r\nrequires a nerve of the most cast-iron description. I suppose I was\r\nwalking up and down in front of that house for half an hour before I\r\ncould bring myself to dash in at the front gate and slide round to the\r\nside where the study window was. And even then I stood for about ten\r\nminutes cowering against the wall and listening for police-whistles.\r\n\r\nEventually, however, I braced myself up and got to business. The study\r\nwas on the ground floor and the window was nice and large, and, what is\r\nmore, wide open. I got the old knee over the sill, gave a jerk which\r\ntook an inch of skin off my ankle, and hopped down into the room. And\r\nthere I was, if you follow me.\r\n\r\nI stood for a moment, listening. Everything seemed to be all right. I\r\nwas apparently alone in the world.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I was so much alone that the atmosphere seemed positively\r\ncreepy. You know how it is on these occasions. There was a clock on the\r\nmantelpiece that ticked in a slow, shocked sort of way that was dashed\r\nunpleasant. And over the clock a large portrait stared at me with a\r\ngood deal of dislike and suspicion. It was a portrait of somebody's\r\ngrandfather. Whether he was Rosie's or Bingo's I didn't know, but he\r\nwas certainly a grandfather. In fact, I wouldn't be prepared to swear\r\nthat he wasn't a great-grandfather. He was a big, stout old buffer in\r\na high collar that seemed to hurt his neck, for he had drawn his chin\r\nback a goodish way and was looking down his nose as much as to say,\r\n'You made me put this dam' thing on!'\r\n\r\nWell, it was only a step to the desk, and nothing between me and it but\r\na brown shaggy rug; so I avoided grandfather's eye and, summoning up\r\nthe good old bulldog courage of the Woosters, moved forward and started\r\nto navigate the rug. And I had hardly taken a step when the south-east\r\ncorner of it suddenly detached itself from the rest and sat up with a\r\nsnuffle.\r\n\r\nWell, I mean to say, to bear yourself fittingly in the face of an\r\noccurrence of this sort you want to be one of those strong, silent,\r\nphlegmatic birds who are ready for anything. This type of bloke, I\r\nimagine, would simply have cocked an eye at the rug, said to himself,\r\n'Ah, a Pekingese dog, and quite a good one, too!' and started at once\r\nto make cordial overtures to the animal in order to win its sympathy\r\nand moral support. I suppose I must be one of the neurotic younger\r\ngeneration you read about in the papers nowadays, because it was\r\npretty plain within half a second that I wasn't strong and I wasn't\r\nphlegmatic. This wouldn't have mattered so much, but I wasn't silent\r\neither. In the emotion of the moment I let out a sort of sharp yowl and\r\nleaped about four feet in a north-westerly direction. And there was a\r\ncrash that sounded as though somebody had touched off a bomb.\r\n\r\nWhat a female novelist wants with an occasional table in her study\r\ncontaining a vase, two framed photographs, a saucer, a lacquer box,\r\nand a jar of potpourri, I don't know; but that was what Bingo's Rosie\r\nhad, and I caught it squarely with my right hip and knocked it endways.\r\nIt seemed to me for a moment as if the whole world had dissolved into\r\na kind of cataract of glass and china. A few years ago, when I legged\r\nit to America to elude my Aunt Agatha, who was out with her hatchet, I\r\nremember going to Niagara and listening to the Falls. They made much\r\nthe same sort of row, but not so loud.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same instant the dog began to bark.\r\n\r\nIt was a small dog--the sort of animal from which you would have\r\nexpected a noise like a squeaking slate-pencil; but it was simply\r\nbaying. It had retired into a corner, and was leaning against the wall\r\nwith bulging eyes; and every two seconds it chucked its head back in a\r\nkind of pained way and let out another terrific bellow.\r\n\r\nWell, I know when I'm licked. I was sorry for Bingo and regretted the\r\nnecessity of having to let him down; but the time had come, I felt, to\r\nshift. 'Outside for Bertram!' was the slogan, and I took a running leap\r\nat the window and scrambled through.\r\n\r\nAnd there on the path, as if they had been waiting for me by\r\nappointment, stood a policeman and a parlourmaid.\r\n\r\nIt was an embarrassing moment.\r\n\r\n'Oh--er--there you are!' I said. And there was what you might call a\r\ncontemplative silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n'I told you I heard something,' said the parlourmaid.\r\n\r\nThe policeman was regarding me in a boiled way.\r\n\r\n'What's all this?' he asked.\r\n\r\nI smiled in a sort of saint-like manner.\r\n\r\n'It's a little hard to explain,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is!' said the policeman.\r\n\r\n'I was just--er--just having a look round, you know. Old friend of the\r\nfamily, you understand.'\r\n\r\n'How did you get in?'\r\n\r\n'Through the window. Being an old friend of the family, if you follow\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'Old friend of the family, are you?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, very. Very. Very old. Oh, a very old friend of the family.'\r\n\r\n'I've never seen him before,' said the parlourmaid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI looked at the girl with positive loathing. How she could have\r\ninspired affection in anyone, even a French cook, beat me. Not that she\r\nwas a bad-looking girl, mind you. Not at all. On another and happier\r\noccasion I might even have thought her rather pretty. But now she\r\nseemed one of the most unpleasant females I had ever encountered.\r\n\r\n'No,' I said. 'You have never seen me before. But I'm an old friend of\r\nthe family.'\r\n\r\n'Then why didn't you ring at the front door?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't want to give any trouble.'\r\n\r\n'It's no trouble answering front doors, that being what you're paid\r\nfor,' said the parlourmaid virtuously. 'I've never seen him before in\r\nmy life,' she added, perfectly gratuitously. A horrid girl.\r\n\r\n'Well, look here,' I said, with an inspiration, 'the undertaker knows\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'What undertaker?'\r\n\r\n'The cove who was waiting at table when I dined here the night before\r\nlast.'\r\n\r\n'Did the undertaker wait at table on the sixteenth instant?' asked the\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\n'Of course he didn't,' said the parlourmaid.\r\n\r\n'Well, he looked like--By Jove, no. I remember now. He was the\r\ngreengrocer.'\r\n\r\n'On the sixteenth instant,' said the policeman--pompous ass!--'did the\r\ngreengrocer--?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he did, if you want to know,' said the parlourmaid. She seemed\r\ndisappointed and baffled, like a tigress that sees its prey being\r\nsneaked away from it. Then she brightened. 'But this fellow could\r\neasily have found that out by asking round about.'\r\n\r\nA perfectly poisonous girl.\r\n\r\n'What's your name?' asked the policeman.\r\n\r\n'Well, I say, do you mind awfully if I don't give my name, because--'\r\n\r\n'Suit yourself. You'll have to tell it to the magistrate.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, I say, dash it!'\r\n\r\n'I think you'd better come along.'\r\n\r\n'But I say, really, you know, I am an old friend of the family. Why, by\r\nJove, now I remember, there's a photograph of me in the drawing-room.\r\nWell, I mean, that shows you!'\r\n\r\n'If there is,' said the policeman.\r\n\r\n'I've never seen it,' said the parlourmaid.\r\n\r\nI absolutely hated this girl.\r\n\r\n'You would have seen it if you had done your dusting more\r\nconscientiously,' I said severely. And I meant it to sting, by Jove!\r\n\r\n'It is not a parlourmaid's place to dust the drawing-room,' she sniffed\r\nhaughtily.\r\n\r\n'No,' I said bitterly. 'It seems to be a parlourmaid's place to\r\nlurk about and hang about and--er--waste her time fooling about in\r\nthe garden with policemen who ought to be busy about their duties\r\nelsewhere.'\r\n\r\n'It's a parlourmaid's place to open the front door to visitors. Them\r\nthat don't come in through windows.'\r\n\r\nI perceived that I was getting the loser's end of the thing. I tried to\r\nbe conciliatory.\r\n\r\n'My dear old parlourmaid,' I said, 'don't let us descend to vulgar\r\nwrangling. All I'm driving at is that there is a photograph of me in\r\nthe drawing-room, cared for and dusted by whom I know not; and this\r\nphotograph will, I think, prove to you that I am an old friend of the\r\nfamily. I fancy so, officer?'\r\n\r\n'If it's there,' said the man in a grudging way.\r\n\r\n'Oh, it's there all right. On, yes, it's there.'\r\n\r\n'Well, we'll go to the drawing-room and see.'\r\n\r\n'Spoken like a man, my dear old policeman,' I said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was on the first floor, and the photograph was on\r\nthe table by the fireplace. Only, if you understand me, it wasn't.\r\nWhat I mean is there was the fireplace, and there was the table by the\r\nfireplace, but, by Jove, not a sign of any photograph of me whatsoever.\r\nA photograph of Bingo, yes. A photograph of Bingo's uncle, Lord\r\nBittlesham, right. A photograph of Mrs Bingo, three-quarter face, with\r\na tender smile on her lips, all present and correct. But of anything\r\nresembling Bertram Wooster, not a trace.\r\n\r\n'Ho!' said the policeman.\r\n\r\n'But, dash it, it was there the night before last.'\r\n\r\n'Ho!' he said again. 'Ho! Ho!' As if he were starting a drinking-chorus\r\nin a comic opera, confound him.\r\n\r\nThen I got what amounted to the brain-wave of a lifetime.\r\n\r\n'Who dusts these things?' I said, turning on the parlourmaid.\r\n\r\n'I don't.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't say you did. I said who did.'\r\n\r\n'Mary. The housemaid, of course.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. As I suspected. As I foresaw. Mary, officer, is notoriously\r\nthe worst smasher in London. There have been complaints about her on\r\nall sides. You see what has happened? The wretched girl has broken the\r\nglass of my photograph and, not being willing to come forward and admit\r\nit in an honest, manly way, has taken the thing off and concealed it\r\nsomewhere.'\r\n\r\n'Ho!' said the policeman, still working through the drinking-chorus.\r\n\r\n'Well, ask her. Go down and ask her.'\r\n\r\n'You go down and ask her,' said the policeman to the parlourmaid. 'If\r\nit's going to make him any happier.'\r\n\r\nThe parlourmaid left the room, casting a pestilential glance at me over\r\nher shoulder as she went. I'm not sure she didn't say 'Ho!' too. And\r\nthen there was a bit of a lull. The policeman took up a position with a\r\nlarge beefy back against the door, and I wandered to and fro and hither\r\nand yonder.\r\n\r\n'What are you playing at?' demanded the policeman.\r\n\r\n'Just looking round. They may have moved the thing.'\r\n\r\n'Ho!'\r\n\r\nAnd then there was another bit of a lull. And suddenly I found myself\r\nby the window, and, by Jove, it was six inches open at the bottom. And\r\nthe world beyond looked so bright and sunny and--Well, I don't claim\r\nthat I am a particularly swift thinker, but once more something seemed\r\nto whisper 'Outside for Bertram!' I slid my finger nonchalantly under\r\nthe sash, gave a hefty heave, and up she came. And the next moment I\r\nwas in a laurel bush, feeling like the cross which marks the spot where\r\nthe accident occurred.\r\n\r\nA large red face appeared in the window. I got up and skipped lightly\r\nto the gate.\r\n\r\n'Hi!' shouted the policeman.\r\n\r\n'Ho!' I replied, and went forth, moving well.\r\n\r\n'This,' I said to myself, as I hailed a passing cab and sank back on\r\nthe cushions, 'is the last time I try to do anything for young Bingo!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese sentiments I expressed in no guarded language to Jeeves when I\r\nwas back in the old flat with my feet on the mantelpiece, pushing down\r\na soothing whisky-and.\r\n\r\n'Never again, Jeeves!' I said. 'Never again!'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir--'\r\n\r\n'No, never again!'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir--'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean, \"Well, sir\"? What are you driving at?'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir, Mr Little is an extremely persistent young gentleman, and\r\nyours, if I may say so, sir, is a yielding and obliging nature--'\r\n\r\n'You don't think that young Bingo would have the immortal rind to try\r\nto get me into some other foul enterprise?'\r\n\r\n'I should say that it was more than probable, sir.'\r\n\r\nI removed the dogs swiftly from the mantelpiece, and jumped up, all of\r\na twitter.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, what would you advise?'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir, I think a little change of scene would be judicious.'\r\n\r\n'Do a bolt?'\r\n\r\n'Precisely, sir. If I might suggest it, sir, why not change your mind\r\nand join Mr George Travers at Harrogate?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say, Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'You would be out of what I might describe as the danger zone there,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you're right, Jeeves,' I said thoughtfully. 'Yes, possibly\r\nyou're right. How far is Harrogate from London?'\r\n\r\n'Two hundred and six miles, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I think you're right. Is there a train this afternoon?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. You could catch it quite easily.'\r\n\r\n'All right, then. Bung a few necessaries in a bag.'\r\n\r\n'I have already done so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Ho!' I said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt's a rummy thing, but when you come down to it Jeeves is always\r\nright. He had tried to cheer me up at the station by saying that I\r\nwould not find Harrogate unpleasant, and, by Jove, he was perfectly\r\ncorrect. What I had overlooked, when examining the project, was the\r\nfact that I should be in the middle of a bevy of blokes who were taking\r\nthe cure and I shouldn't be taking it myself. You've no notion what a\r\ndashed cosy, satisfying feeling that gives a fellow.\r\n\r\nI mean to say, there was old Uncle George, for instance. The\r\nmedicine-man, having given him the once-over, had ordered him to\r\nabstain from all alcoholic liquids, and in addition to tool down the\r\nhill to the Royal Pump-Room each morning at eight-thirty and imbibe\r\ntwelve ounces of warm crescent saline and magnesia. It doesn't sound\r\nmuch, put that way, but I gather from contemporary accounts that it's\r\npractically equivalent to getting outside a couple of little old last\r\nyear's eggs beaten up in sea-water. And the thought of Uncle George,\r\nwho had oppressed me sorely in my childhood, sucking down that stuff\r\nand having to hop out of bed at eight-fifteen to do so was extremely\r\ngrateful and comforting of a morning.\r\n\r\nAt four in the afternoon he would toddle down the hill again and repeat\r\nthe process, and at night we would dine together and I would loll back\r\nin my chair, sipping my wine, and listen to him telling me what the\r\nstuff had tasted like. In many ways the ideal existence.\r\n\r\nI generally managed to fit it in with my engagements to go down and\r\nwatch him tackle his afternoon dose, for we Woosters are as fond of a\r\nlaugh as anyone. And it was while I was enjoying the performance in the\r\nmiddle of the second week that I heard my name spoken. And there was\r\nAunt Dahlia.\r\n\r\n'Hallo!' I said. 'What are you doing here?'\r\n\r\n'I came down yesterday with Tom.'\r\n\r\n'Is Tom taking the cure?' asked Uncle George, looking up hopefully from\r\nthe hell-brew.\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Are you taking the cure?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Uncle George, looking happier than I had seen him for days.\r\nHe swallowed the last drops, and then, the programme calling for a\r\nbrisk walk before his massage, left us.\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't have thought you would have been able to get away from\r\nthe paper,' I said. 'I say,' I went on, struck by a pleasing idea. 'It\r\nhasn't bust up, has it?'\r\n\r\n'Bust up? I should say not. A pal of mine is looking after it for me\r\nwhile I'm here. It's right on its feet now. Tom has given me a couple\r\nof thousand and says there's more if I want it, and I've been able\r\nto buy the serial rights of Lady Bablockhythe's _Frank Recollections\r\nof a Long Life_. The hottest stuff, Bertie. Certain to double the\r\ncirculation and send half the best-known people in London into\r\nhysterics for a year.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' I said. 'Then you're pretty well fixed, what? I mean, what with\r\nthe Frank Recollections and that article of Mrs Little's.'\r\n\r\nAunt Dahlia was drinking something that smelled like a leak in the\r\ngas-pipe, and I thought for a moment that it was that that made her\r\ntwist up her face. But I was wrong.\r\n\r\n'Don't mention that woman to me, Bertie!' she said. 'One of the worst.'\r\n\r\n'But I thought you were rather pally.'\r\n\r\n'No longer. Will you credit it that she positively refuses to let me\r\nhave that article--'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'--purely and simply on account of some fancied grievance she thinks\r\nshe has against me because her cook left her and came to me.'\r\n\r\nI couldn't follow this at all.\r\n\r\n'Anatole left her?' I said. 'But what about the parlourmaid?'\r\n\r\n'Pull yourself together, Bertie. You're babbling. What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Why, I understood--'\r\n\r\n'I'll bet you never understood anything in your life.' She laid down\r\nher empty glass. 'Well, that's done!' she said with relief. 'Thank\r\ngoodness, I'll be able to watch Tom drinking his in a few minutes.\r\nIt's the only thing that enables me to bear up. Poor old chap, he does\r\nhate it so! But I cheer him by telling him it's going to put him in\r\nshape for Anatole's cooking. And that, Bertie, is something worth going\r\ninto training for. A master of his art, that man. Sometimes I'm not\r\naltogether surprised that Mrs Little made such a fuss when he went.\r\nBut, really, you know, she ought not to mix sentiment with business.\r\nShe has no right to refuse to let me have that article just because of\r\na private difference. Well, she jolly well can't use it anywhere else,\r\nbecause it was my idea and I have witnesses to prove it. If she tries\r\nto sell it to another paper, I'll sue her. And, talking of sewers, it's\r\nhigh time Tom was here to drink his sulphur-water.'\r\n\r\n'But look here--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, by the way, Bertie,' said Aunt Dahlia, 'I withdraw any harsh\r\nexpressions I may have used about your man Jeeves. A most capable\r\nfeller!'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; he attended to the negotiations. And very well he did it, too.\r\nAnd he hasn't lost by it, you can bet. I saw to that. I'm grateful to\r\nhim. Why, if Tom gives up a couple of thousand now, practically without\r\na murmur, the imagination reels at what he'll do with Anatole cooking\r\nregularly for him. He'll be signing cheques in his sleep.'\r\n\r\nI got up. Aunt Dahlia pleaded with me to stick around and watch Uncle\r\nTom in action, claiming it to be a sight nobody should miss, but I\r\ncouldn't wait. I rushed up the hill, left a farewell note for Uncle\r\nGeorge, and caught the next train for London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, when I had washed off the stains of travel, 'tell me\r\nfrankly all about it. Be as frank as Lady Bablockhythe.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind, if you've not heard of her. Tell me how you worked\r\nthis binge. The last I heard was that Anatole loved that\r\nparlourmaid--goodness knows why!--so much that he refused to leave her.\r\nWell, then?'\r\n\r\n'I was somewhat baffled for a while, I must confess, sir. Then I was\r\nmaterially assisted by a fortunate discovery.'\r\n\r\n'What was that?'\r\n\r\n'I chanced to be chatting with Mrs Travers's housemaid, sir, and,\r\nremembering that Mrs Little was anxious to obtain a domestic of that\r\ndescription, I asked her if she would consent to leave Mrs Travers and\r\ngo at an advanced wage to Mrs Little. To this she assented, and I saw\r\nMrs Little and arranged the matter.'\r\n\r\n'Well? What was the fortunate discovery?'\r\n\r\n'That the girl, in a previous situation some little time back, had\r\nbeen a colleague of Anatole, sir. And Anatole, as is the too frequent\r\npractice of these Frenchmen, had made love to her. In fact, they were,\r\nso I understand it, sir, formally affianced until Anatole disappeared\r\none morning, leaving no address, and passed out of the poor girl's\r\nlife. You will readily appreciate that this discovery simplified\r\nmatters considerably. The girl no longer had any affection for Anatole,\r\nbut the prospect of being under the same roof with two young persons,\r\nboth of whom he had led to assume--'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott! Yes, I see! It was rather like putting in a ferret to\r\nstart a rabbit.'\r\n\r\n'The principle was much the same, sir. Anatole was out of the house\r\nand in Mrs Travers's service within half an hour of the receipt of the\r\ninformation that the young person was about to arrive. A volatile man,\r\nsir. Like so many of these Frenchmen.'\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'this is genius of a high order.'\r\n\r\n'It is very good of you to say so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What did Mr Little say about it?'\r\n\r\n'He appeared gratified, sir.'\r\n\r\n'To go into sordid figures, did he--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Twenty pounds. Having been fortunate in his selections at\r\nHurst Park on the previous Saturday.'\r\n\r\n'My aunt told me that she--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Most generous. Twenty-five pounds.'\r\n\r\n'Good Lord, Jeeves! You've been coining the stuff!'\r\n\r\n'I have added appreciably to my savings, yes, sir. Mrs Little was\r\ngood enough to present me with ten pounds for finding her such a\r\nsatisfactory housemaid. And then there was Mr Travers--'\r\n\r\n'Uncle Thomas?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. He also behaved most handsomely, quite independently of Mrs\r\nTravers. Another twenty-five pounds. And Mr George Travers--'\r\n\r\n'Don't tell me that Uncle George gave you something, too! What on earth\r\nfor?'\r\n\r\n'Well, really, sir, I do not quite understand myself. But I received a\r\ncheque for ten pounds from him. He seemed to be under the impression\r\nthat I had been in some way responsible for your joining him at\r\nHarrogate, sir.'\r\n\r\nI gaped at the fellow.\r\n\r\n'Well, everybody seems to be doing it,' I said, 'so I suppose I had\r\nbetter make the thing unanimous. Here's a fiver.'\r\n\r\n'Why, thank you, sir. This is extremely--'\r\n\r\n'It won't seem much compared with these vast sums you've been\r\nacquiring.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I assure you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And I don't know why I'm giving it to you.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Still, there it is.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much, sir.'\r\n\r\nI got up.\r\n\r\n'It's pretty late,' I said, 'but I think I'll dress and go out and have\r\na bite somewhere. I feel like having a whirl of some kind after two\r\nweeks at Harrogate.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. I will unpack your clothes.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Jeeves,' I said, 'did Peabody and Simms send those soft silk\r\nshirts?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. I sent them back.'\r\n\r\n'Sent them back!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\nI eyed him for a moment. But I mean to say. I mean, what's the use?\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' I said. 'Then lay out one of the gents' stiff-bosomed.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir,' said Jeeves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      10--Bertie Changes his Mind\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has happened so frequently in the past few years that young fellows\r\nstarting in my profession have come to me for a word of advice, that\r\nI have found it convenient now to condense my system into a brief\r\nformula. 'Resource and Tact'--that is my motto. Tact, of course, has\r\nalways been with me a _sine qua non_; while as for resource, I think I\r\nmay say that I have usually contrived to show a certain modicum of what\r\nI might call _finesse_ in handling those little _contretemps_ which\r\ninevitably arise from time to time in the daily life of a gentleman's\r\npersonal gentleman. I am reminded, by way of an instance, of the\r\nEpisode of the School for Young Ladies near Brighton--an affair which,\r\nI think, may be said to have commenced one evening at the moment when I\r\nbrought Mr Wooster his whisky and siphon and he addressed me with such\r\nremarkable petulance.\r\n\r\nNot a little moody Mr Wooster had been for some days--far from his\r\nusual bright self. This I had attributed to the natural reaction from\r\na slight attack of influenza from which he had been suffering; and, of\r\ncourse, took no notice, merely performing my duties as usual, until on\r\nthe evening of which I speak he exhibited this remarkable petulance\r\nwhen I brought him his whisky and siphon.\r\n\r\n'Oh, dash it, Jeeves!' he said, manifestly overwrought. 'I wish at\r\nleast you'd put it on another table for a change.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?' I said.\r\n\r\n'Every night, dash it all,' proceeded Mr Wooster morosely, 'you come in\r\nat exactly the same old time with the same old tray and put it on the\r\nsame old table. I'm fed up, I tell you. It's the bally monotony of it\r\nthat makes it all seem so frightfully bally.'\r\n\r\nI confess that his words filled me with a certain apprehension. I had\r\nheard gentlemen in whose employment I have been speak in very much the\r\nsame way before, and it had almost invariably meant that they were\r\ncontemplating matrimony. It disturbed me, therefore, I am free to\r\nadmit, when Mr Wooster addressed me in this fashion. I had no desire\r\nto sever a connexion so pleasant in every respect as his and mine had\r\nbeen, and my experience is that when the wife comes in at the front\r\ndoor the valet of bachelor days goes out at the back.\r\n\r\n'It's not your fault, of course,' went on Mr Wooster, regaining a\r\ncertain degree of composure. 'I'm not blaming you. But, by Jove, I\r\nmean, you must acknowledge--I mean to say, I've been thinking pretty\r\ndeeply these last few days, Jeeves, and I've come to the conclusion\r\nmine is an empty life. I'm lonely, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'You have a great many friends, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What's the good of friends?'\r\n\r\n'Emerson,' I reminded him, 'says a friend may well be reckoned the\r\nmasterpiece of Nature, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you can tell Emerson from me next time you see him that he's an\r\nass.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What I want--Jeeves, have you seen that play called\r\nI-forget-its-dashed-name?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'It's on at the What-d'you-call-it. I went last night. The hero's\r\na chap who's buzzing along, you know, quite merry and bright, and\r\nsuddenly a kid turns up and says she's his daughter. Left over from act\r\none, you know--absolutely the first he'd heard of it. Well, of course,\r\nthere's a bit of a fuss and they say to him \"What-ho?\" and he says,\r\n\"Well, what about it?\" and they say, \"Well, _what_ about it?\" and he\r\nsays, \"Oh all right, then, if that's the way you feel!\" and he takes\r\nthe kid and goes off with her out into the world together, you know.\r\nWell, what I'm driving at, Jeeves, is that I envied that chappie. Most\r\nawfully jolly little girl, you know, clinging to him trustingly and\r\nwhat-not. Something to look after, if you know what I mean. Jeeves, I\r\nwish I had a daughter. I wonder what the procedure is?'\r\n\r\n'Marriage is, I believe, considered the preliminary step, sir.'\r\n\r\n'No, I mean about adopting a kid. You can adopt kids, you know, Jeeves.\r\nBut what I want to know is how you start about it.'\r\n\r\n'The process, I should imagine, would be highly complicated and\r\nlaborious, sir. It would cut into your spare time.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll tell you what I could do, then. My sister will be back from\r\nIndia next week with her three little girls. I'll give up this flat\r\nand take a house and have them all to live with me. By Jove, Jeeves,\r\nI think that's rather a scheme, what? Prattle of childish voices, eh?\r\nLittle feet pattering hither and thither, yes?'\r\n\r\nI concealed my perturbation, but the effort to preserve my _sang-froid_\r\ntested my powers to the utmost. The course of action outlined by Mr\r\nWooster meant the finish of our cosy bachelor establishment if it came\r\ninto being as a practical proposition; and no doubt some men in my\r\nplace would at this juncture have voiced their disapproval. I avoided\r\nthis blunder.\r\n\r\n'If you will pardon my saying so, sir,' I suggested, 'I think you\r\nare not quite yourself after your influenza. If I might express the\r\nopinion, what you require is a few days by the sea. Brighton is very\r\nhandy, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Are you suggesting that I'm talking through my hat?'\r\n\r\n'By no means, sir. I merely advocate a short stay at Brighton as a\r\nphysical recuperative.'\r\n\r\nMr Wooster considered.\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm not sure you're not right,' he said at length. 'I _am_\r\nfeeling more or less of an onion. You might shove a few things in a\r\nsuit-case and drive me down in the car tomorrow.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And when we get back I'll be in the pink and ready to tackle this\r\npattering-feet wheeze.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly, sir.'\r\n\r\nWell, it was a respite, and I welcomed it. But I began to see that a\r\ncrisis had arisen which would require adroit handling. Rarely had I\r\nobserved Mr Wooster more set on a thing. Indeed, I could recall no\r\nsuch exhibition of determination on his part since the time when he\r\nhad insisted, against my frank disapproval, on wearing purple socks.\r\nHowever, I had coped successfully with that outbreak, and I was by\r\nno means unsanguine that I should eventually be able to bring the\r\npresent affair to a happy issue. Employers are like horses. They\r\nrequire managing. Some gentlemen's personal gentlemen have the knack of\r\nmanaging them, some have not. I, I am happy to say, have no cause for\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor myself, I found our stay at Brighton highly enjoyable, and should\r\nhave been willing to extend it, but Mr Wooster, still restless, wearied\r\nof the place by the end of two days, and on the third afternoon he\r\ninstructed me to pack up and bring the car round to the hotel. We\r\nstarted back along the London road at about five on a fine summer's\r\nday, and had travelled perhaps two miles when I perceived in the road\r\nbefore us a young lady, gesticulating with no little animation. I\r\napplied the brake and brought the vehicle to a standstill.\r\n\r\n'What,' inquired Mr Wooster, waking from a reverie, 'is the big thought\r\nat the back of this, Jeeves?'\r\n\r\n'I observed a young lady endeavouring to attract our attention with\r\nsignals a little way down the road, sir,' I explained. 'She is now\r\nmaking her way towards us.'\r\n\r\nMr Wooster peered.\r\n\r\n'I see her. I expect she wants a lift, Jeeves.'\r\n\r\n'That was the interpretation which I placed upon her actions, sir.'\r\n\r\n'A jolly-looking kid,' said Mr Wooster. 'I wonder what she's doing,\r\nbiffing about the high road.'\r\n\r\n'She has the air to me, sir, of one who has been absenting herself\r\nwithout leave from her school, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Hallo-allo-allo!' said Mr Wooster, as the child reached us. 'Do you\r\nwant a lift?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say, can you?' said the child, with marked pleasure.\r\n\r\n'Where do you want to go?'\r\n\r\n'There's a turning to the left about a mile farther on. If you'll put\r\nme down there, I'll walk the rest of the way. I say, thanks awfully.\r\nI've got a nail in my shoe.'\r\n\r\nShe climbed in at the back. A red-haired young person with a snub-nose\r\nand an extremely large grin. Her age, I should imagine, would be\r\nabout twelve. She let down one of the spare seats, and knelt on it to\r\nfacilitate conversation.\r\n\r\n'I'm going to get into a frightful row,' she began. 'Miss Tomlinson\r\nwill be perfectly furious.'\r\n\r\n'No, really?' said Mr Wooster.\r\n\r\n'It's a half-holiday, you know, and I sneaked away to Brighton, because\r\nI wanted to go on the pier and put pennies in the slot-machines. I\r\nthought I could get back in time so that nobody would notice I'd gone,\r\nbut I got this nail in my shoe, and now there'll be a fearful row. Oh,\r\nwell,' she said, with a philosophy which, I confess, I admired, 'it\r\ncan't be helped. What's your car? A Sunbeam, isn't it? We've got a\r\nWolseley at home.'\r\n\r\nMr Wooster was visibly perturbed. As I have indicated, he was at this\r\ntime in a highly malleable frame of mind, tender-hearted to a degree\r\nwhere the young of the female sex was concerned. Her sad case touched\r\nhim deeply.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say, this is rather rotten,' he observed. 'Isn't there anything\r\nto be done? I say, Jeeves, don't you think something could be done?'\r\n\r\n'It was not my place to make the suggestion, sir,' I replied, 'but,\r\nas you yourself have brought the matter up, I fancy the trouble is\r\nsusceptible of adjustment. I think it would be a legitimate subterfuge\r\nwere you to inform the young lady's schoolmistress that you are an old\r\nfriend of the young lady's father. In this case you could inform Miss\r\nTomlinson that you had been passing the school and had seen the young\r\nlady at the gate and taken her for a drive. Miss Tomlinson's chagrin\r\nwould no doubt in these circumstances be sensibly diminished if not\r\naltogether dispersed.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you _are_ a sportsman!' observed the young person, with\r\nconsiderable enthusiasm. And she proceeded to kiss me--in connexion\r\nwith which I have only to say that I was sorry she had just been\r\ndevouring some sticky species of sweetmeat.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves, you've hit it!' said Mr Wooster. 'A sound, even fruity,\r\nscheme. I say, I suppose I'd better know your name and all that, if I'm\r\na friend of your father's.'\r\n\r\n'My name's Peggy Mainwaring, thanks awfully,' said the young person.\r\n'And my father's Professor Mainwaring. He's written a lot of books.\r\nYou'll be expected to know that.'\r\n\r\n'Author of the well-known series of philosophical treatises, sir,' I\r\nventured to interject. 'They have a great vogue, though, if the young\r\nlady will pardon my saying so, many of the Professor's opinions strike\r\nme personally as somewhat empirical. Shall I drive on to the school,\r\nsir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, carry on. I say, Jeeves, it's a rummy thing. Do you know, I've\r\nnever been inside a girls' school in my life.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Ought to be a dashed interesting experience, Jeeves, what?'\r\n\r\n'I fancy that you may find it so, sir,' I said.\r\n\r\nWe drove on a matter of half a mile down a lane, and, directed by\r\nthe young person, I turned in at the gates of a house of imposing\r\ndimensions, bringing the car to a halt at the front door. Mr Wooster\r\nand the child entered, and presently a parlourmaid came out.\r\n\r\n'You're to take the car round to the stables, please,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' I said. 'Then everything is satisfactory, eh? Where has Mr\r\nWooster gone?'\r\n\r\n'Miss Peggy has taken him off to meet her friends. And cook says she\r\nhopes you'll step round to the kitchen later and have a cup of tea.'\r\n\r\n'Inform her that I shall be delighted. Before I take the car to\r\nthe stables, would it be possible for me to have a word with Miss\r\nTomlinson?'\r\n\r\nA moment later I was following her into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nHandsome but strong-minded--that was how I summed up Miss Tomlinson at\r\nfirst glance. In some ways she recalled to my mind Mr Wooster's Aunt\r\nAgatha. She had the same penetrating gaze and that indefinable air of\r\nbeing reluctant to stand any nonsense.\r\n\r\n'I fear I am possibly taking a liberty, madam,' I began, 'but I\r\nam hoping that you will allow me to say a word with respect to my\r\nemployer. I fancy I am correct in supposing that Mr Wooster did not\r\ntell you a great deal about himself?'\r\n\r\n'He told me nothing about himself, except that he was a friend of\r\nProfessor Mainwaring.'\r\n\r\n'He did not inform you, then, that he was _the_ Mr Wooster?'\r\n\r\n'_The_ Mr Wooster?'\r\n\r\n'Bertram Wooster, madam.'\r\n\r\nI will say for Mr Wooster that, mentally negligible though he no doubt\r\nis, he has a name that suggests almost infinite possibilities. He\r\nsounds, if I may elucidate my meaning, like Someone--especially if you\r\nhave just been informed that he is an intimate friend of so eminent a\r\nman as Professor Mainwaring. You might not, no doubt, be able to say\r\noffhand whether he was Bertram Wooster the novelist, or Bertram Wooster\r\nthe founder of a new school of thought; but you would have an uneasy\r\nfeeling that you were exposing your ignorance if you did not give the\r\nimpression of familiarity with the name. Miss Tomlinson, as I had\r\nrather foreseen, nodded brightly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, _Bertram_ Wooster!' she said.\r\n\r\n'He is an extremely retiring gentleman, madam, and would be the last to\r\nsuggest it himself, but, knowing him as I do, I am sure that he would\r\ntake it as a graceful compliment if you were to ask him to address the\r\nyoung ladies. He is an excellent extempore speaker.'\r\n\r\n'A very good idea,' said Miss Tomlinson decidedly. 'I am very much\r\nobliged to you for suggesting it. I will certainly ask him to talk to\r\nthe girls.'\r\n\r\n'And should he make a pretence--through modesty--of not wishing--'\r\n\r\n'I shall insist.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, madam. I am obliged. You will not mention my share in the\r\nmatter? Mr Wooster might think that I had exceeded my duties.'\r\n\r\nI drove round to the stables and halted the car in the yard. As I got\r\nout, I looked at it somewhat intently. It was a good car, and appeared\r\nto be in excellent condition, but somehow I seemed to feel that\r\nsomething was going to go wrong with it--something serious--something\r\nthat would not be able to be put right again for at least a couple of\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nOne gets these presentiments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may have been some half-hour later that Mr Wooster came into\r\nthe stable-yard as I was leaning against the car enjoying a quiet\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\n'No, don't chuck it away, Jeeves,' he said, as I withdrew the cigarette\r\nfrom my mouth. 'As a matter of fact, I've come to touch you for a\r\nsmoke. Got one to spare?'\r\n\r\n'Only gaspers, I fear, sir.'\r\n\r\n'They'll do,' responded Mr Wooster, with no little eagerness.\r\nI observed that his manner was a trifle fatigued and his eye\r\nsomewhat wild. 'It's a rummy thing, Jeeves, I seem to have lost my\r\ncigarette-case. Can't find it anywhere.'\r\n\r\n'I am sorry to hear that, sir. It is not in the car.'\r\n\r\n'No? Must have dropped it somewhere, then.' He drew at his gasper with\r\nrelish. 'Jolly creatures, small girls, Jeeves,' he remarked, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n'Extremely so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Of course, I can imagine some fellows finding them a bit exhausting\r\nin--er--'\r\n\r\n'_En masse_, sir?'\r\n\r\n'That's the word. A bit exhausting _en masse_.'\r\n\r\n'I must confess, sir, that that is how they used to strike me. In\r\nmy younger day, at the outset of my career, sir, I was at one time\r\npage-boy in a school for young ladies.'\r\n\r\n'No, really? I never knew that before. I say, Jeeves--er--did\r\nthe--er--dear little souls _giggle_ much in your day?'\r\n\r\n'Practically without cessation, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Makes a fellow feel a bit of an ass, what? I shouldn't wonder if they\r\nusedn't to stare at you from time to time, too, eh?'\r\n\r\n'At the school where I was employed, sir, the young ladies had a\r\nregular game which they were accustomed to play when a male visitor\r\narrived. They would stare fixedly at him and giggle, and there was a\r\nsmall prize for the one who made him blush first.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, I say, Jeeves, not really?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. They derived great enjoyment from the pastime.'\r\n\r\n'I'd no idea small girls were such demons.'\r\n\r\n'More deadly than the male, sir.'\r\n\r\nMr Wooster passed a handkerchief over his brow.\r\n\r\n'Well, we're going to have tea in a few minutes, Jeeves. I expect I\r\nshall feel better after tea.'\r\n\r\n'We will hope so, sir.'\r\n\r\nBut I was by no means sanguine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had an agreeable tea in the kitchen. The buttered toast was good and\r\nthe maids nice girls, though with little conversation. The parlourmaid,\r\nwho joined us towards the end of the meal, after performing her duties\r\nin the school dining-room, reported that Mr Wooster was sticking it\r\npluckily, but seemed feverish. I went back to the stable-yard, and I\r\nwas just giving the car another look over when the young Mainwaring\r\nchild appeared.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I say,' she said, 'will you give this to Mr Wooster when you see\r\nhim?' She held out Mr Wooster's cigarette-case. 'He must have dropped\r\nit somewhere. I say,' she proceeded, 'it's an awful lark. He's going to\r\ngive a lecture to the school.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, miss?'\r\n\r\n'We love it when there are lectures. We sit and stare at the poor\r\ndears, and try to make them dry up. There was a man last term who got\r\nhiccoughs. Do you think Mr Wooster will get hiccoughs?'\r\n\r\n'We can but hope for the best, miss.'\r\n\r\n'It would be such a lark, wouldn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Highly enjoyable, miss.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I must be getting back. I want to get a front seat.'\r\n\r\nAnd she scampered off. An engaging child. Full of spirits.\r\n\r\nShe had hardly gone when there was an agitated noise, and round the\r\ncorner came Mr Wooster. Perturbed. Deeply so.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Start the car!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'I'm off!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\nMr Wooster danced a few steps.\r\n\r\n'Don't stand there saying \"sir?\" I tell you I'm off. Bally off! There's\r\nnot a moment to waste. The situation's desperate. Dash it, Jeeves, do\r\nyou know what's happened? The Tomlinson female has just sprung it on\r\nme that I'm expected to make a speech to the girls! Got to stand up\r\nthere in front of the whole dashed collection and talk! I can just see\r\nmyself! Get that car going, Jeeves, dash it all. A little speed, a\r\nlittle speed!'\r\n\r\n'Impossible, I fear, sir. The car is out of order.'\r\n\r\nMr Wooster gaped at me. Very glassily he gaped.\r\n\r\n'Out of order!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Something is wrong. Trivial, perhaps, but possibly a matter\r\nof some little time to repair.' Mr Wooster, being one of those easy\r\ngoing young gentlemen who will drive a car but never take the trouble\r\nto study its mechanism, I felt justified in becoming technical. 'I\r\nthink it is the differential gear, sir. Either that or the exhaust.'\r\n\r\nI am fond of Mr Wooster, and I admit I came very near to melting as I\r\nlooked at his face. He was staring at me in a sort of dumb despair that\r\nwould have touched anybody.\r\n\r\n'Then I'm sunk! Or'--a slight gleam of hope flickered across his drawn\r\nfeatures--'do you think I could sneak out and leg it across country,\r\nJeeves?'\r\n\r\n'Too late, I fear, sir.' I indicated with a slight gesture the\r\napproaching figure of Miss Tomlinson, who was advancing with a serene\r\ndetermination in his immediate rear.\r\n\r\n'Ah, there you are, Mr Wooster.'\r\n\r\nHe smiled a sickly smile.\r\n\r\n'Yes--er--here I am!'\r\n\r\n'We are all waiting for you in the large schoolroom.'\r\n\r\n'But I say, look here,' said Mr Wooster, 'I--I don't know a bit what to\r\ntalk about.'\r\n\r\n'Why, anything, Mr Wooster. Anything that comes into your head. Be\r\nbright,' said Miss Tomlinson. 'Bright and amusing.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, bright and amusing?'\r\n\r\n'Possibly tell them a few entertaining stories. But, at the same\r\ntime, do not neglect the graver note. Remember that my girls are on\r\nthe threshold of life, and will be eager to hear something brave and\r\nhelpful and stimulating--something which they can remember in after\r\nyears. But, of course, you know the sort of thing, Mr Wooster. Come.\r\nThe young people are waiting.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have spoken earlier of resource and the part it plays in the life\r\nof a gentleman's personal gentleman. It is a quality peculiarly\r\nnecessary if one is to share in scenes not primarily designed for one's\r\ncooperation. So much that is interesting in life goes on apart behind\r\nclosed doors that your gentleman's gentleman, if he is not to remain\r\nhopelessly behind the march of events, should exercise his wits in\r\norder to enable himself to be--if not a spectator--at least an auditor\r\nwhen there is anything of interest toward. I deprecate as vulgar and\r\nundignified the practice of listening at keyholes, but without lowering\r\nmyself to that, I have generally contrived to find a way.\r\n\r\nIn the present case it was simple. The large schoolroom was situated on\r\nthe ground floor, with commodious French windows, which, as the weather\r\nwas clement, remained open throughout the proceedings. By stationing\r\nmyself behind a pillar on the porch or veranda which adjoined the room,\r\nI was enabled to see and hear all. It was an experience which I should\r\nbe sorry to have missed. Mr Wooster, I may say at once, indubitably\r\nexcelled himself.\r\n\r\nMr Wooster is a young gentleman with practically every desirable\r\nquality except one. I do not mean brains, for in an employer brains are\r\nnot desirable. The quality to which I allude is hard to define, but\r\nperhaps I might call it the gift of dealing with the Unusual Situation.\r\nIn the presence of the Unusual, Mr Wooster is too prone to smile weakly\r\nand allow his eyes to protrude. He lacks Presence. I have often wished\r\nthat I had the power to bestow upon him some of the _savoir-faire_ of\r\na former employer of mine, Mr Montague-Todd, the well-known financier,\r\nnow in the second year of his sentence. I have known men call upon Mr\r\nTodd with the express intention of horsewhipping him and go away half\r\nan hour later laughing heartily and smoking one of his cigars. To Mr\r\nTodd it would have been child's play to speak a few impromptu words to\r\na schoolroom full of young ladies; in fact, before he had finished,\r\nhe would probably have induced them to invest all their pocket-money\r\nin one of his numerous companies; but to Mr Wooster it was plainly an\r\nordeal of the worst description. He gave one look at the young ladies,\r\nwho were all staring at him in an extremely unwinking manner, then\r\nblinked and started to pick feebly at his coat-sleeve. His aspect\r\nreminded me of that of a bashful young man who, persuaded against his\r\nbetter judgement to go on the platform and assist a conjurer in his\r\nentertainment, suddenly discovers that rabbits and hard-boiled eggs are\r\nbeing taken out of the top of his head.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings opened with a short but graceful speech of introduction\r\nfrom Miss Tomlinson.\r\n\r\n'Girls,' said Miss Tomlinson, 'some of you have already met Mr\r\nWooster--Mr _Bertram_ Wooster, and you all, I hope, know him by\r\nreputation.' Here, I regret to say, Mr Wooster gave a hideous, gurgling\r\nlaugh and, catching Miss Tomlinson's eye, turned a bright scarlet.\r\nMiss Tomlinson resumed: 'He has very kindly consented to say a few\r\nwords to you before he leaves, and I am sure that you will all give him\r\nyour very earnest attention. Now, please.'\r\n\r\nShe gave a spacious gesture with her right hand as she said the last\r\ntwo words, and Mr Wooster, apparently under the impression that they\r\nwere addressed to him, cleared his throat and began to speak. But it\r\nappeared that her remark was directed to the young ladies, and was\r\nin the nature of a cue or signal, for she had no sooner spoken to\r\nthem than the whole school rose to its feet in a body and burst into\r\na species of chant, of which I am glad to say I remember the words,\r\nthough the tune eludes me. The words ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    Many greetings to you!\r\n    Many greetings to you!\r\n    Many greetings, dear stranger,\r\n    Many greetings,\r\n    Many greetings,\r\n    Many greetings to you!\r\n    Many greetings to you!\r\n    To you!\r\n\r\nConsiderable latitude of choice was given to the singers in the matter\r\nof key, and there was little of what I might call co-operative effort.\r\nEach child went on till she had reached the end, then stopped and\r\nwaited for the stragglers to come up. It was an unusual performance,\r\nand I, personally, found it extremely exhilarating. It seemed to smite\r\nMr Wooster, however, like a blow. He recoiled a couple of steps and\r\nflung up an arm defensively. Then the uproar died away, and an air\r\nof expectancy fell upon the room. Miss Tomlinson directed a brightly\r\nauthoritative gaze upon Mr Wooster, and he blinked, gulped once or\r\ntwice, and tottered forward.\r\n\r\n'Well, you know--' he said.\r\n\r\nThen it seemed to strike him that this opening lacked the proper formal\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n'Ladies--'\r\n\r\nA silvery peal of laughter from the front row stopped him again.\r\n\r\n'Girls!' said Miss Tomlinson. She spoke in a low, soft voice, but the\r\neffect was immediate. Perfect stillness instantly descended upon all\r\npresent. I am bound to say that, brief as my acquaintance with Miss\r\nTomlinson had been, I could recall few women I had admired more. She\r\nhad grip.\r\n\r\nI fancy that Miss Tomlinson had gauged Mr Wooster's oratorical\r\ncapabilities pretty correctly by this time, and had come to the\r\nconclusion that little in the way of a stirring address was to be\r\nexpected from him.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' she said, 'as it is getting late, and he has not very much\r\ntime to spare, Mr Wooster will just give you some little word of advice\r\nwhich may be helpful to you in after-life, and then we will sing the\r\nschool song and disperse to our evening lessons.'\r\n\r\nShe looked at Mr Wooster. He passed a finger round the inside of his\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n'Advice? After-life? What? Well, I don't know--'\r\n\r\n'Just some brief word of counsel, Mr Wooster,' said Miss Tomlinson\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, well--Well, yes--Well--' It was painful to see Mr Wooster's brain\r\nendeavouring to work. 'Well, I'll tell you something that's often done\r\n_me_ a bit of good, and it's a thing not many people know. My old Uncle\r\nHenry gave me the tip when I first came to London. \"Never forget, my\r\nboy,\" he said, \"that, if you stand outside Romano's in the Strand, you\r\ncan see the clock on the wall of the Law Courts down in Fleet Street.\r\nMost people who don't know don't believe it's possible, because there\r\nare a couple of churches in the middle of the road, and you would think\r\nthey would be in the way. But you can, and it's worth knowing. You\r\ncan win a lot of money betting on it with fellows who haven't found\r\nit out.\" And, by Jove, he was perfectly right, and it's a thing to\r\nremember. Many a quid have I--'\r\n\r\nMiss Tomlinson gave a hard, dry cough, and he stopped in the middle of\r\na sentence.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it will be better, Mr Wooster,' she said, in a cold, even\r\nvoice, 'if you were to tell my girls some little story. What you say\r\nis, no doubt, extremely interesting, but perhaps a little--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, ah, yes,' said Mr Wooster. 'Story? Story?' He appeared completely\r\ndistraught, poor young gentleman. 'I wonder if you've heard the one\r\nabout the stockbroker and the chorus-girl?'\r\n\r\n'We will now sing the school song,' said Miss Tomlinson, rising like an\r\niceberg.\r\n\r\nI decided not to remain for the singing of the school song. It seemed\r\nprobable to me that Mr Wooster would shortly be requiring the car, so I\r\nmade my way back to the stable-yard, to be in readiness.\r\n\r\nI had not long to wait. In a very few moments he appeared, tottering.\r\nMr Wooster's is not one of those inscrutable faces which it is\r\nimpossible to read. On the contrary, it is a limpid pool in which is\r\nmirrored each passing emotion. I could read it now like a book, and his\r\nfirst words were very much on the lines I had anticipated.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' he said hoarsely, 'is that damned car mended yet?'\r\n\r\n'Just this moment, sir. I have been working on it assiduously.'\r\n\r\n'Then, for heaven's sake, let's go!'\r\n\r\n'But I understood that you were to address the young ladies, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I've done that!' responded Mr Wooster, blinking twice with\r\nextraordinary rapidity. 'Yes, I've done that.'\r\n\r\n'It was a success, I hope, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Most extraordinarily successful. Went like a breeze.\r\nBut--er--I think I may as well be going. No use outstaying one's\r\nwelcome, what?'\r\n\r\n'Assuredly not, sir.'\r\n\r\nI had climbed into my seat and was about to start the engine, when\r\nvoices made themselves heard; and at the first sound of them Mr Wooster\r\nsprang with almost incredible nimbleness into the tonneau, and when I\r\nglanced round he was on the floor covering himself with a rug. The last\r\nI saw of him was a pleading eye.\r\n\r\n'Have you seen Mr Wooster, my man?'\r\n\r\nMiss Tomlinson had entered the stable-yard, accompanied by a lady of, I\r\nshould say, judging from her accent, French origin.\r\n\r\n'No, madam.'\r\n\r\nThe French lady uttered some exclamation in her native tongue.\r\n\r\n'Is anything wrong, madam?' I inquired.\r\n\r\nMiss Tomlinson in normal mood was, I should be disposed to imagine,\r\na lady who would not readily confide her troubles to the ear of a\r\ngentleman's gentleman, however sympathetic his aspect. That she did so\r\nnow was sufficient indication of the depth to which she was stirred.\r\n\r\n'Yes, there is! Mademoiselle has just found several of the girls\r\nsmoking cigarettes in the shrubbery. When questioned, they stated that\r\nMr Wooster had given them the horrid things.' She turned. 'He must be\r\nin the garden somewhere, or in the house. I think the man is out of his\r\nsenses. Come, mademoiselle!'\r\n\r\nIt must have been about a minute later that Mr Wooster poked his head\r\nout of the rug like a tortoise.\r\n\r\n'Jeeves!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Get a move on! Start her up! Get going and _keep_ going!'\r\n\r\nI applied my foot to the self-starter.\r\n\r\n'It would perhaps be safest to drive carefully until we are out of\r\nthe school grounds, sir,' I said. 'I might run over one of the young\r\nladies, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what's the objection to that?' demanded Mr Wooster with\r\nextraordinary bitterness.\r\n\r\n'Or even Miss Tomlinson sir.'\r\n\r\n'Don't!' said Mr Wooster wistfully. 'You make my mouth water!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Jeeves,' said Mr Wooster, when I brought him his whisky and siphon one\r\nnight about a week later, 'this is dashed jolly.'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Jolly. Cosy and pleasant, you know. I mean, looking at the clock and\r\nwondering if you're going to be late with the good old drinks, and then\r\nyou coming in with the tray always on time, never a minute late, and\r\nshoving it down on the table and biffing off, and the next night coming\r\nin and shoving it down and biffing off, and the next night--I mean,\r\ngives you a sort of safe, restful feeling. Soothing! That's the word.\r\nSoothing!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Oh, by the way, sir--'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'Have you succeeded in finding a suitable house yet, sir?'\r\n\r\n'House? What do you mean, house?'\r\n\r\n'I understood, sir, that it was your intention to give up the flat and\r\ntake a house of sufficient size to enable you to have your sister, Mrs\r\nScholfield, and her three young ladies to live with you.'\r\n\r\nMr Wooster shuddered strongly.\r\n\r\n'That's off, Jeeves,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir,' I replied."
