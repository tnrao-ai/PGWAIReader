Through a gleaming\r\neye-glass he inspected the revolting object which Parker, his faithful\r\nman, had placed on a plate before him.\r\n\r\n“Parker!” His voice had a ring of pain.\r\n\r\n“Sir?”\r\n\r\n“What’s this?”\r\n\r\n“Poached egg, sir.”\r\n\r\nFreddie averted his eyes with a silent shudder.\r\n\r\n“It looks just like an old aunt of mine,” he said. “Remove it!”\r\n\r\nHe got up, and, wrapping his dressing-gown about his long legs, took up\r\na stand in front of the fireplace. From this position he surveyed the\r\nroom, his shoulders against the mantelpiece, his calves pressing the\r\nclub-fender. It was a cheerful oasis in a chill and foggy world, a\r\ntypical London bachelor’s breakfast-room. The walls were a restful\r\ngray, and the table, set for two, a comfortable arrangement in white\r\nand silver.\r\n\r\n“Eggs, Parker,” said Freddie solemnly, “are the acid test!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir?”\r\n\r\n“If, on the morning after, you can tackle a poached egg, you are all\r\nright. If not, not. And don’t let anybody tell you otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\nFreddie pressed the palm of his hand to his brow, and sighed.\r\n\r\n“It would seem, then, that I must have revelled a trifle\r\nwhole-heartedly last night. I was possibly a little blotto. Not\r\nwhiffled, perhaps, but indisputably blotto. Did I make much noise\r\ncoming in?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. You were very quiet.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! A dashed bad sign!”\r\n\r\nFreddie moved to the table, and poured himself a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n“The cream-jug is to your right, sir,” said the helpful Parker.\r\n\r\n“Let it remain there. Café noir for me this morning. As noir as it can\r\njolly well stick!” Freddie retired to the fireplace and sipped\r\ndelicately. “As far as I can remember, it was Ronny Devereux’ birthday\r\nor something …”\r\n\r\n“Mr Martyn’s, I think you said, sir.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. Algy Martyn’s birthday, and Ronny and I were the guests.\r\nIt all comes back to me. I wanted Derek to roll along and join the\r\nfestivities—he’s never met Ronny—but he gave it a miss. Quite right! A\r\nchap in his position has responsibilities. Member of Parliament and all\r\nthat. Besides,” said Freddie earnestly, driving home the point with a\r\nwave of his spoon, “he’s engaged to be married. You must remember that,\r\nParker!”\r\n\r\n“I will endeavor to, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” said Freddie dreamily, “I wish I were engaged to be\r\nmarried. Sometimes I wish I had some sweet girl to watch over me and …\r\nNo, I don’t, by Jove! It would give me the utter pip! Is Sir Derek up\r\nyet, Parker?”\r\n\r\n“Getting up, sir.”\r\n\r\n“See that everything is all right, will you? I mean as regards the\r\nfoodstuffs and what not. I want him to make a good breakfast. He’s got\r\nto meet his mother this morning at Charing Cross. She’s legging it back\r\nfrom the Riviera.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir?”\r\n\r\nFreddie shook his head.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t speak in that light, careless tone if you knew her! Well,\r\nyou’ll see her tonight. She’s coming here to dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Mariner will be here, too. A foursome. Tell Mrs Parker to pull up\r\nher socks and give us something pretty ripe. Soup, fish, all that sort\r\nof thing. _She_ knows. And let’s have a stoup of malvoisie from the\r\noldest bin. This is a special occasion!”\r\n\r\n“Her ladyship will be meeting Miss Mariner for the first time, sir?”\r\n\r\n“You’ve put your finger on it! Absolutely the first time on this or any\r\nstage! We must all rally round and make the thing a success.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure Mrs Parker will strain every nerve, sir.” Parker moved to\r\nthe door, carrying the rejected egg, and stepped aside to allow a tall,\r\nwell-built man of about thirty to enter. “Good morning, Sir Derek.”\r\n\r\n“Morning, Parker.”\r\n\r\nParker slid softly from the room. Derek Underhill sat down at the\r\ntable. He was a strikingly handsome man, with a strong, forceful face,\r\ndark, lean and cleanly shaven. He was one of those men whom a stranger\r\nwould instinctively pick out of a crowd as worthy of note. His only\r\ndefect was that his heavy eyebrows gave him at times an expression\r\nwhich was a little forbidding. Women, however, had never been repelled\r\nby it. He was very popular with women, not quite so popular with\r\nmen—always excepting Freddie Rooke, who worshipped him. They had been\r\nat school together, though Freddie was the younger by several years.\r\n\r\n“Finished, Freddie?” asked Derek.\r\n\r\nFreddie smiled wanly,\r\n\r\n“We are not breakfasting this morning,” he replied. “The spirit was\r\nwilling, but the jolly old flesh would have none of it. To be perfectly\r\nfrank, the Last of the Rookes has a bit of a head.”\r\n\r\n“Ass!” said Derek.\r\n\r\n“A bit of sympathy,” said Freddie, pained, “would not be out of place.\r\nWe are far from well. Some person unknown has put a threshing-machine\r\ninside the old bean and substituted a piece of brown paper for our\r\ntongue. Things look dark and yellow and wobbly!”\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t have overdone it last night.”\r\n\r\n“It was Algy Martyn’s birthday,” pleaded Freddie.\r\n\r\n“If I were an ass like Algy Martyn,” said Derek, “I wouldn’t go about\r\nadvertising the fact that I’d been born. I’d hush it up!”\r\n\r\nHe helped himself to a plentiful portion of kedgeree, Freddie watching\r\nhim with repulsion mingled with envy. When he began to eat, the\r\nspectacle became too poignant for the sufferer, and he wandered to the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n“What a beast of a day!”\r\n\r\nIt was an appalling day. January, that grim month, was treating London\r\nwith its usual severity. Early in the morning a bank of fog had rolled\r\nup off the river, and was deepening from pearly white to a lurid brown.\r\nIt pressed on the window-pane like a blanket, leaving dark, damp\r\nrivulets on the glass.\r\n\r\n“Awful!” said Derek.\r\n\r\n“Your mater’s train will be late.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Damned nuisance. It’s bad enough meeting trains in any case,\r\nwithout having to hang about a draughty station for an hour.”\r\n\r\n“And it’s sure, I should imagine,” went on Freddie, pursuing his train\r\nof thought, “to make the dear old thing pretty tolerably ratty, if she\r\nhas one of those slow journeys.” He pottered back to the fireplace, and\r\nrubbed his shoulders reflectively against the mantelpiece. “I take it\r\nthat you wrote to her about Jill?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. That’s why she’s coming over, I suppose. By the way, you\r\ngot those seats for that theatre tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Three together and one somewhere on the outskirts. If it’s all\r\nthe same to you, old thing, I’ll have the one on the outskirts.”\r\n\r\nDerek, who had finished his kedgeree and was now making himself a blot\r\non Freddie’s horizon with toast and marmalade, laughed.\r\n\r\n“What a rabbit you are, Freddie! Why on earth are you so afraid of\r\nmother?”\r\n\r\nFreddie looked at him as a timid young squire might have gazed upon St.\r\nGeorge when the latter set out to do battle with the dragon. He was of\r\nthe amiable type which makes heroes of its friends. In the old days\r\nwhen he had fagged for him at Winchester he had thought Derek the most\r\nwonderful person in the world, and this view he still retained. Indeed,\r\nsubsequent events had strengthened it. Derek had done the most amazing\r\nthings since leaving school. He had had a brilliant career at Oxford,\r\nand now, in the House of Commons, was already looked upon by the\r\nleaders of his party as one to be watched and encouraged. He played\r\npolo superlatively well, and was a fine shot. But of all his gifts and\r\nqualities the one that extorted Freddie’s admiration in its intensest\r\nform was his lion-like courage as exemplified by his behavior in the\r\npresent crisis. There he sat, placidly eating toast and marmalade,\r\nwhile the boat-train containing Lady Underhill already sped on its way\r\nfrom Dover to London. It was like Drake playing bowls with the Spanish\r\nArmada in sight.\r\n\r\n“I wish I had your nerve!” he said, awed. “What I should be feeling, if\r\nI were in your place and had to meet your mater after telling her that\r\nI was engaged to marry a girl she had never seen, I don’t know. I’d\r\nrather face a wounded tiger!”\r\n\r\n“Idiot!” said Derek placidly.\r\n\r\n“Not,” pursued Freddie, “that I mean to say anything in the least\r\nderogatory and so forth to your jolly old mater, if you understand me,\r\nbut the fact remains she scares me pallid! Always has, ever since the\r\nfirst time I went to stay at your place when I was a kid. I can still\r\nremember catching her eye the morning I happened by pure chance to bung\r\nan apple through her bedroom window, meaning to let a cat on the sill\r\nbelow have it in the short ribs. She was at least thirty feet away,\r\nbut, by Jove, it stopped me like a bullet!”\r\n\r\n“Push the bell, old man, will you? I want some more toast.”\r\n\r\nFreddie did as he was requested with growing admiration.\r\n\r\n“The condemned man made an excellent breakfast,” he murmured. “More\r\ntoast, Parker,” he added, as that admirable servitor opened the door.\r\n“Gallant! That’s what I call it. Gallant!”\r\n\r\nDerek tilted his chair back.\r\n\r\n“Mother is sure to like Jill when she sees her,” he said.\r\n\r\n“_When_ she sees her! Ah! But the trouble is, young feller-me-lad, that\r\nshe _hasn’t_ seen her! That’s the weak spot in your case, old\r\ncompanion! A month ago she didn’t know of Jill’s existence. Now, you\r\nknow and I know that Jill is one of the best and brightest. As far as\r\nwe are concerned, everything in the good old garden is lovely. Why,\r\ndash it, Jill and I were children together. Sported side by side on the\r\ngreen, and what not. I remember Jill, when she was twelve, turning the\r\ngarden-hose on me and knocking about seventy-five per cent off the\r\nmarket value of my best Sunday suit. That sort of thing forms a bond,\r\nyou know, and I’ve always felt that she was a corker. But your mater’s\r\ngot to discover it for herself. It’s a dashed pity, by Jove, that Jill\r\nhasn’t a father or a mother or something of that species to rally round\r\njust now. They would form a gang. There’s nothing like a gang! But\r\nshe’s only got that old uncle of hers. A rummy bird! Met him?”\r\n\r\n“Several times. I like him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s a genial old buck all right. A very bonhomous lad. But you\r\nhear some pretty queer stories about him if you get among people who\r\nknew him in the old days. Even now I’m not so dashed sure I should care\r\nto play cards with him. Young Threepwood was telling me only the other\r\nday that the old boy took thirty quid off him at picquet as clean as a\r\nwhistle. And Jimmy Monroe, who’s on the Stock Exchange, says he’s\r\nfrightfully busy these times buying margins or whatever it is chappies\r\ndo down in the City. Margins. That’s the word. Jimmy made me buy some\r\nmyself on a thing called Amalgamated Dyes. I don’t understand the\r\nprocedure exactly, but Jimmy says it’s a sound egg and will do me a bit\r\nof good. What was I talking about? Oh, yes, old Selby. There’s no doubt\r\nhe’s quite a sportsman. But till you’ve got Jill well established, you\r\nknow, I shouldn’t enlarge on him too much with the mater.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said Derek. “I shall mention him at the first\r\nopportunity. He knew my father out in India.”\r\n\r\n“Did he, by Jove! Oh, well, that makes a difference.”\r\n\r\nParker entered with the toast, and Derek resumed his breakfast.\r\n\r\n“It may be a little bit awkward,” he said, “at first, meeting mother.\r\nBut everything will be all right after five minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely! But, oh, boy! that first five minutes!” Freddie gazed\r\nportentously through his eye-glass. Then he seemed to be undergoing\r\nsome internal struggle, for he gulped once or twice. “That first five\r\nminutes!” he said, and paused again. A moment’s silent self-communion,\r\nand he went on with a rush. “I say, listen. Shall I come along, too?”\r\n\r\n“Come along?”\r\n\r\n“To the station. With you.”\r\n\r\n“What on earth for?”\r\n\r\n“To see you through the opening stages. Break the ice and all that sort\r\nof thing. Nothing like collecting a gang, you know. Moments when a\r\nfeller needs a friend and so forth. Say the word, and I’ll buzz along\r\nand lend my moral support.”\r\n\r\nDerek’s heavy eyebrows closed together in an offended frown, and seemed\r\nto darken his whole face. This unsolicited offer of assistance hurt his\r\ndignity. He showed a touch of the petulance which came now and then\r\nwhen he was annoyed, to suggest that he might not possess so strong a\r\ncharacter as his exterior indicated.\r\n\r\n“It’s very kind of you,” he began stiffly.\r\n\r\nFreddie nodded. He was acutely conscious of this himself.\r\n\r\n“Some fellows,” he observed, “would say ‘Not at all!’ I suppose. But\r\nnot the Last of the Rookes! For, honestly, old man, between ourselves,\r\nI don’t mind admitting that this _is_ the bravest deed of the year, and\r\nI’m dashed if I would do it for anyone else.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very good of you, Freddie …”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right. I’m a Boy Scout, and this is my act of kindness for\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\nDerek got up from the table.\r\n\r\n“Of course you mustn’t come,” he said. “We can’t form a sort of\r\ndebating society to discuss Jill on the platform at Charing Cross.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I would just hang around in the offing, shoving in an occasional\r\ntactful word.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“The wheeze would simply be to …”\r\n\r\n“It’s impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well,” said Freddie, damped. “Just as you say, of course. But\r\nthere’s nothing like a gang, old man, nothing like a gang!”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nDerek Underhill threw down the stump of his cigar, and grunted\r\nirritably. Inside Charing Cross Station business was proceeding as\r\nusual. Porters wheeling baggage-trucks moved to and fro like\r\nJuggernauts. Belated trains clanked in, glad to get home, while others,\r\nless fortunate, crept reluctantly out through the blackness and\r\ndisappeared into an inferno of detonating fog-signals. For outside the\r\nfog still held. The air was cold and raw and tasted coppery. In the\r\nstreet traffic moved at a funeral pace, to the accompaniment of hoarse\r\ncries and occasional crashes. Once the sun had worked its way through\r\nthe murk and had hung in the sky like a great red orange, but now all\r\nwas darkness and discomfort again, blended with that odd suggestion of\r\nmystery and romance which is a London fog’s only redeeming quality.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Derek that he had been patrolling the platform for a\r\nlife-time, but he resumed his sentinel duty. The fact that the\r\nboat-train, being already forty-five minutes overdue, might arrive at\r\nany moment made it imperative that he remain where he was instead of\r\nsitting, as he would much have preferred to sit, in one of the\r\nwaiting-rooms. It would be a disaster if his mother should get out of\r\nthe train and not find him there to meet her. That was just the sort of\r\nthing which would infuriate her; and her mood, after a Channel crossing\r\nand a dreary journey by rail, would be sufficiently dangerous as it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe fog and the waiting had had their effect upon Derek. The resolute\r\nfront he had exhibited to Freddie at the breakfast-table had melted\r\nsince his arrival at the station, and he was feeling nervous at the\r\nprospect of the meeting that lay before him. Calm as he had appeared to\r\nthe eye of Freddie and bravely as he had spoken, Derek, in the recesses\r\nof his heart, was afraid of his mother. There are men—and Derek\r\nUnderhill was one of them—who never wholly emerge from the nursery.\r\nThey may put away childish things and rise in the world to affluence\r\nand success, but the hand that rocked their cradle still rules their\r\nlives. As a boy, Derek had always been firmly controlled by his mother,\r\nand the sway of her aggressive personality had endured through manhood.\r\nLady Underhill was a born ruler, dominating most of the people with\r\nwhom life brought her in contact. Distant cousins quaked at her name,\r\nwhile among the male portion of her nearer relatives she was generally\r\nalluded to as The Family Curse.\r\n\r\nNow that his meeting with her might occur at any moment, Derek shrank\r\nfrom it. It was not likely to be a pleasant one. The mere fact that\r\nLady Underhill was coming to London at all made that improbable. When a\r\nman writes to inform his mother, who is wintering on the Riviera, that\r\nhe has become engaged to be married, the natural course for her to\r\npursue, if she approves of the step, is to wire her congratulations and\r\ngood wishes. When for these she substitutes a curt announcement that\r\nshe is returning immediately, a certain lack of complaisance seems to\r\nbe indicated.\r\n\r\nWould his mother approve of Jill? That was the question which he had\r\nbeen asking himself over and over again as he paced the platform in the\r\ndisheartening fog. Nothing had been said, nothing had even been hinted,\r\nbut he was perfectly aware that his marriage was a matter regarding\r\nwhich Lady Underhill had always assumed that she was to be consulted,\r\neven if she did not, as he suspected, claim the right to dictate. And\r\nhe had become engaged quite suddenly, without a word to her until it\r\nwas all over and settled.\r\n\r\nThat, as Freddie had pointed out, was the confoundedly awkward part of\r\nit. His engagement had been so sudden. Jill had swept into his life\r\nlike a comet. His mother knew nothing of her. A month ago he had known\r\nnothing of her himself. It would, he perceived, as far as the\r\nbenevolent approval of Lady Underhill was concerned, have been an\r\naltogether different matter had his choice fallen upon one of those\r\ndamsels whose characters, personality, and ancestry she knew. Daughters\r\nof solid and useful men; sisters of rising young politicians like\r\nhimself; nieces of Burke’s peerage; he could have introduced without\r\nembarrassment one of these in the role of bride-elect. But Jill … Oh,\r\nwell, when once his mother had met Jill, everything was sure to be all\r\nright. Nobody could resist Jill. It would be like resisting the\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nSomewhat comforted by this reflection, Derek turned to begin one more\r\nwalk along the platform, and stopped in mid-stride, raging. Beaming\r\nover the collar of a plaid greatcoat, all helpfulness and devotion,\r\nFreddie Rooke was advancing towards him, the friend that sticketh\r\ncloser than a brother. Like some loving dog, who, ordered home, sneaks\r\nsoftly on through alleys and by-ways, peeping round corners and\r\ncrouching behind lamp-posts, the faithful Freddie had followed him\r\nafter all. And with him, to add the last touch to Derek’s discomfiture,\r\nwere those two inseparable allies of his, Ronny Devereux and Algy\r\nMartyn.\r\n\r\n“Well, old thing,” said Freddie, patting Derek encouragingly on the\r\nshoulder, “here we are after all! I know you told me not to roll round\r\nand so forth, but I knew you didn’t mean it. I thought it over after\r\nyou had left, and decided it would be a rotten trick not to cluster\r\nabout you in your hour of need. I hope you don’t mind Ronny and Algy\r\nbreezing along, too. The fact is, I was in the deuce of a funk—your\r\njolly old mater always rather paralyzes my nerve-centers, you know—so I\r\nroped them in. Met ’em in Piccadilly, groping about for the club, and\r\nconscripted ’em both, they very decently consenting. We all toddled off\r\nand had a pick-me-up at that chemist chappie’s at the top of the\r\nHay-market, and now we’re feeling full of beans and buck, ready for\r\nanything. I’ve explained the whole thing to them, and they’re with you\r\nto the death! Collect a gang, dear boy, collect a gang! That’s the\r\nmotto. There’s nothing like it!”\r\n\r\n“Nothing!” said Ronny.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely nothing!” said Algy.\r\n\r\n“We’ll just see you through the opening stages,” said Freddie, “and\r\nthen leg it. We’ll keep the conversation general, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Stop it getting into painful channels,” said Ronny.\r\n\r\n“Steer it clear,” said Algy, “of the touchy topic.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the wheeze,” said Freddie. “We’ll … Oh, golly! There’s the\r\ntrain coming in now!” His voice quavered, for not even the comforting\r\npresence of his two allies could altogether sustain him in this ordeal.\r\nBut he pulled himself together with a manful effort. “Stick it, old\r\nbeans!” he said doughtily. “Now is the time for all good men to come to\r\nthe aid of the party!”\r\n\r\n“We’re here!” said Ronny Devereux.\r\n\r\n“On the spot!” said Algy Martyn.\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nThe boat-train slid into the station. Bells rang, engines blew off\r\nsteam, porters shouted, baggage-trucks rattled over the platform. The\r\ntrain began to give up its contents, now in ones and twos, now in a\r\nsteady stream. Most of the travellers seemed limp and exhausted, and\r\nwere pale with the pallor that comes of a choppy Channel crossing.\r\nAlmost the only exception to the general condition of collapse was the\r\neagle-faced lady in the brown ulster, who had taken up her stand in the\r\nmiddle of the platform and was haranguing a subdued little maid in a\r\nvoice that cut the gloomy air like a steel knife. Like the other\r\ntravellers, she was pale, but she bore up resolutely. No one could have\r\ntold from Lady Underhill’s demeanor that the solid platform seemed to\r\nheave beneath her feet like a deck.\r\n\r\n“Have you got a porter, Ferris? Where is he, then? Ah! Have you got all\r\nthe bags? My jewel-case? The suit-case? The small brown bag? The rugs?\r\nWhere are the rugs?\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can see them, my good girl. There is no need to brandish them\r\nin my face. Keep the jewel-case and give the rest of the things to the\r\nporter, and take him to look after the trunks. You remember which they\r\nare? The steamer trunk, the other trunk, the black box … Very well.\r\nThen make haste. And, when you’ve got them all together, tell the\r\nporter to find you a four-wheeler. The small things will go inside.\r\nDrive to the Savoy and ask for my suite. If they make any difficulty,\r\ntell them that I engaged the rooms yesterday by telegraph from Mentone.\r\nDo you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, m’lady.”\r\n\r\n“Then go along. Oh, and give the porter sixpence. Sixpence is ample.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, m’lady.”\r\n\r\nThe little maid, grasping the jewel-case, trotted off beside the now\r\npessimistic porter, who had started on this job under the impression\r\nthat there was at least a bob’s-worth in it. The remark about the\r\nsixpence had jarred the porter’s faith in his species.\r\n\r\nDerek approached, acutely conscious of Freddie, Ronny, and Algy, who\r\nwere skirmishing about his flank. He had enough to worry him without\r\nthem. He had listened with growing apprehension to the catalogue of his\r\nmother’s possessions. Plainly this was no flying visit. You do not pop\r\nover to London for a day or two with a steamer trunk, another trunk, a\r\nblack box, a suit-case, and a small brown bag. Lady Underhill had\r\nevidently come prepared to stay; and the fact seemed to presage\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n“Well, mother! So there you are at last!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Derek!”\r\n\r\nDerek kissed his mother. Freddie, Ronny, and Algy shuffled closer, like\r\nleopards. Freddie, with the expression of one who leads a forlorn hope,\r\nmoved his Adam’s apple briskly up and down several times, and spoke.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Lady Underhill?”\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr Rooke?”\r\n\r\nLady Underhill bowed stiffly and without pleasure. She was not fond of\r\nthe Last of the Rookes. She supposed the Almighty had had some wise\r\npurpose in creating Freddie, but it had always been inscrutable to her.\r\n\r\n“Like you,” mumbled Freddie, “to meet my friends. Lady Underhill. Mr\r\nDevereux.”\r\n\r\n“Charmed,” said Ronny affably.\r\n\r\n“Mr Martyn.”\r\n\r\n“Delighted,” said Algy with old-world courtesy.\r\n\r\nLady Underhill regarded this mob-scene with an eye of ice.\r\n\r\n“How do you do?” she said. “Have you come to meet somebody?”\r\n\r\n“I-er-we-er-why-er—” This woman always made Freddie feel as if he were\r\nbeing disembowelled by some clumsy amateur. He wished that he had\r\ndefied the dictates of his better nature and remained in his snug rooms\r\nat the Albany, allowing Derek to go through this business by himself.\r\n“I-er-we-er-came to meet _you_, don’t you know!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! That was very kind of you!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, not at all.”\r\n\r\n“Thought we’d welcome you back to the old homestead,” said Ronny,\r\nbeaming.\r\n\r\n“What could be sweeter?” said Algy. He produced a cigar-case, and\r\nextracted a formidable torpedo-shaped Havana. He was feeling\r\ndelightfully at his ease, and couldn’t understand why Freddie had made\r\nsuch a fuss about meeting this nice old lady. “Don’t mind if I smoke,\r\ndo you? Air’s a bit raw today. Gets into the lungs.”\r\n\r\nDerek chafed impotently. These unsought allies were making a difficult\r\nsituation a thousand times worse. A more acute observer than young Mr\r\nMartyn, he noted the tight lines about his mother’s mouth and knew them\r\nfor the danger-signal they were. Endeavoring to distract her with light\r\nconversation, he selected a subject which was a little unfortunate.\r\n\r\n“What sort of crossing did you have, mother?”\r\n\r\nLady Underhill winced. A current of air had sent the perfume of Algy’s\r\ncigar playing about her nostrils. She closed her eyes, and her face\r\nturned a shade paler. Freddie, observing this, felt quite sorry for the\r\npoor old thing. She was a pest and a pot of poison, of course, but all\r\nthe same, he reflected charitably, it was a shame that she should look\r\nso green about the gills. He came to the conclusion that she must be\r\nhungry. The thing to do was to take her mind off it till she could be\r\nconducted to a restaurant and dumped down in front of a bowl of soup.\r\n\r\n“Bit choppy, I suppose, what?” he bellowed, in a voice that ran up and\r\ndown Lady Underhill’s nervous system like an electric needle. “I was\r\nafraid you were going to have a pretty rough time of it when I read the\r\nforecast in the paper. The good old boat wobbled a bit, eh?”\r\n\r\nLady Underhill uttered a faint moan. Freddie noticed that she was\r\nlooking deucedly chippy, even chippier than a moment ago.\r\n\r\n“It’s an extraordinary thing about that Channel crossing,” said Algy\r\nMartyn meditatively, as he puffed a refreshing cloud. “I’ve known\r\nfellows who could travel quite happily everywhere else in the\r\nworld—round the Horn in sailing-ships and all that sort of thing—yield\r\nup their immortal soul crossing the Channel! Absolutely yield up their\r\nimmortal soul! Don’t know why. Rummy, but there it is!”\r\n\r\n“I’m like that myself,” assented Ronny Devereux. “That dashed trip from\r\nCalais gets me every time. Bowls me right over. I go aboard, stoked to\r\nthe eyebrows with seasick remedies, swearing that this time I’ll fool\r\n’em, but down I go ten minutes after we’ve started and the next thing I\r\nknow is somebody saying, ‘Well, well! So this is Dover!’”\r\n\r\n“It’s exactly the same with me,” said Freddie, delighted with the\r\nsmooth, easy way the conversation was flowing. “Whether it’s the hot,\r\ngreasy smell of the engines …”\r\n\r\n“It’s not the engines,” contended Ronny Devereux.\r\n\r\n“Stands to reason it can’t be. I rather like the smell of engines. This\r\nstation is reeking with the smell of engine-grease, and I can drink it\r\nin and enjoy it.” He sniffed luxuriantly. “It’s something else.”\r\n\r\n“Ronny’s right,” said Algy cordially. “It isn’t the engines. It’s the\r\nway the boat heaves up and down and up and down and up and down …” He\r\nshifted his cigar to his left hand in order to give with his right a\r\nspirited illustration of a Channel steamer going up and down and up and\r\ndown and up and down. Lady Underhill, who had opened her eyes, had an\r\nexcellent view of the performance, and closed her eyes again quickly.\r\n\r\n“Be quiet!” she snapped.\r\n\r\n“I was only saying …”\r\n\r\n“Be quiet!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, rather!”\r\n\r\nLady Underhill wrestled with herself. She was a woman of great\r\nwill-power and accustomed to triumph over the weaknesses of the flesh.\r\nAfter awhile her eyes opened. She had forced herself, against the\r\nevidence of her senses, to recognize that this was a platform on which\r\nshe stood and not a deck.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Algy, damped, was temporarily out of action, and his\r\nfriends had for the moment nothing to remark.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you had a trying journey, mother,” said Derek. “The train\r\nwas very late.”\r\n\r\n“Now, _train_-sickness,” said Algy, coming to the surface again, “is a\r\nthing lots of people suffer from. Never could understand it myself.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve never had a touch of train-sickness,” said Ronny.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have,” said Freddie. “I’ve often felt rotten on a train. I get\r\nfloating spots in front of my eyes and a sort of heaving sensation, and\r\neverything kind of goes black …”\r\n\r\n“Mr Rooke!”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“I should be greatly obliged if you would keep these confidences for\r\nthe ear of your medical adviser.”\r\n\r\n“Freddie,” intervened Derek hastily, “my mother’s rather tired. Do you\r\nthink you could be going ahead and getting a taxi?”\r\n\r\n“My dear old chap, of course! Get you one in a second. Come along,\r\nAlgy. Pick up the old waukeesis, Ronny.”\r\n\r\nAnd Freddie, accompanied by his henchmen, ambled off, well pleased with\r\nhimself. He had, he felt, helped to break the ice for Derek and had\r\nseen him safely through those awkward opening stages. Now he could\r\ntotter off with a light heart and get a bite of lunch.\r\n\r\nLady Underhill’s eyes glittered. They were small, keen, black eyes,\r\nunlike Derek’s, which were large and brown. In their other features the\r\ntwo were obviously mother and son. Each had the same long upper lip,\r\nthe same thin, firm mouth, the prominent chin which was a family\r\ncharacteristic of the Underhills, and the jutting Underhill nose. Most\r\nof the Underhills came into the world looking as though they meant to\r\ndrive their way through life like a wedge.\r\n\r\n“A little more,” she said tensely, “and I should have struck those\r\nunspeakable young men with my umbrella. One of the things I have never\r\nbeen able to understand, Derek, is why you should have selected that\r\nimbecile Rooke as your closest friend.”\r\n\r\nDerek smiled tolerantly.\r\n\r\n“It was more a case of him selecting _me_. But Freddie is quite a good\r\nfellow really. He’s a man you’ve got to know.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ have not got to know him, and I thank heaven for it!”\r\n\r\n“He’s a very good-natured fellow. It was decent of him to put me up at\r\nthe Albany while our house was let. By the way, he has some seats for\r\nthe first night of a new piece this evening. He suggested that we might\r\nall dine at the Albany and go on to the theatre.” He hesitated a\r\nmoment. “Jill will be there,” he said, and felt easier now that her\r\nname had at last come into the talk. “She’s longing to meet you.”\r\n\r\n“Then why didn’t she meet me?”\r\n\r\n“Here, do you mean? At the station? Well, I—I wanted you to see her for\r\nthe first time in pleasanter surroundings.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Lady Underhill shortly.\r\n\r\nIt is a disturbing thought that we suffer in this world just as much by\r\nbeing prudent and taking precautions as we do by being rash and\r\nimpulsive and acting as the spirit moves us. If Jill had been permitted\r\nby her wary fiancé to come with him to the station to meet his mother,\r\nit is certain that much trouble would have been avoided. True, Lady\r\nUnderhill would probably have been rude to her in the opening stages of\r\nthe interview, but she would not have been alarmed and suspicious; or,\r\nrather, the vague suspicion which she had been feeling would not have\r\nsolidified, as it did now, into definite certainty of the worst. All\r\nthat Derek had effected by his careful diplomacy had been to convince\r\nhis mother that he considered his bride-elect something to be broken\r\ngently to her.\r\n\r\nShe stopped and faced him.\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” she demanded. “Who is this girl?”\r\n\r\nDerek flushed.\r\n\r\n“I thought I made everything clear in my letter.”\r\n\r\n“You made nothing clear at all.”\r\n\r\n“By your leave!” chanted a porter behind them, and a baggage-truck\r\nclove them apart.\r\n\r\n“We can’t talk in a crowded station,” said Derek irritably. “Let me get\r\nyou to the taxi and take you to the hotel. … What do you want to know\r\nabout Jill?”\r\n\r\n“Everything. Where does she come from? Who are her people? I don’t know\r\nany Mariners.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t cross-examined her,” said Derek stiffly. “But I do know that\r\nher parents are dead. Her father was an American.”\r\n\r\n“American!”\r\n\r\n“Americans frequently have daughters, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to be gained by losing your temper,” said Lady\r\nUnderhill with steely calm.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to be gained, as far as I can see, by all this talk,”\r\nretorted Derek. He wondered vexedly why his mother always had this\r\npower of making him lose control of himself. He hated to lose control\r\nof himself. It upset him, and blurred that vision which he liked to\r\nhave of himself as a calm, important man superior to ordinary\r\nweaknesses. “Jill and I are engaged, and there is an end of it.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be a fool,” said Lady Underhill, and was driven away by another\r\nbaggage-truck. “You know perfectly well,” she resumed, returning to the\r\nattack, “that your marriage is a matter of the greatest concern to me\r\nand to the whole of the family.”\r\n\r\n“Listen, mother!” Derek’s long wait on the draughty platform had\r\ngenerated an irritability which overcame the deep-seated awe of his\r\nmother which was the result of years of defeat in battles of the will.\r\n“Let me tell you in a few words all that I know of Jill, and then we’ll\r\ndrop the subject. In the first place, she is a lady. Secondly, she has\r\nplenty of money …”\r\n\r\n“The Underhills do not need to marry for money.”\r\n\r\n“I am not marrying for money!”\r\n\r\n“Well, go on.”\r\n\r\n“I have already described to you in my letter—very inadequately, but I\r\ndid my best—what she looks like. Her sweetness, her loveableness, all\r\nthe subtle things about her which go to make her what she is, you will\r\nhave to judge for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I intend to!”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s all, then. She lives with her uncle, a Major Selby …”\r\n\r\n“Major Selby? What regiment?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t ask him,” snapped the goaded Derek. “And, in the name of\r\nheaven, what does it matter?”\r\n\r\n“Not the Guards?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Probably a line regiment,” said Lady Underhill with an indescribable\r\nsniff.\r\n\r\n“Possibly. What then?” He paused, to play his trump card. “If you are\r\nworrying about Major Selby’s social standing, I may as well tell you\r\nthat he used to know father.”\r\n\r\n“What! When? Where?”\r\n\r\n“Years ago. In India, when father was at Simla.”\r\n\r\n“Selby? Selby? Not Christopher Selby?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you remember him?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly remember him! Not that he and I ever met, but your father\r\noften spoke of him.”\r\n\r\nDerek was relieved. It was abominable that this sort of thing should\r\nmatter, but one had to face facts, and, as far as his mother was\r\nconcerned, it did. The fact that Jill’s uncle had known his dead father\r\nwould make all the difference to Lady Underhill.\r\n\r\n“Christopher Selby!” said Lady Underhill reflectively. “Yes! I have\r\noften heard your father speak of him. He was the man who gave your\r\nfather an I.O.U. to pay a card debt, and redeemed it with a check which\r\nwas returned by the bank!”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you hear what I said? I will repeat it, if you wish.”\r\n\r\n“There must have been some mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Only the one your father made when he trusted the man.”\r\n\r\n“It must have been some other fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Of course!” said Lady Underhill satirically. “No doubt your father\r\nknew hundreds of Christopher Selbys!”\r\n\r\nDerek bit his lip.\r\n\r\n“Well, after all,” he said doggedly, “whether it’s true or not …”\r\n\r\n“I see no reason why your father should not have spoken the truth.”\r\n\r\n“All right. We’ll say it is true, then. But what does it matter? I am\r\nmarrying Jill, not her uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, it would be pleasanter if her only living relative were\r\nnot a swindler!… Tell me, where and how did you meet this girl?”\r\n\r\n“I should be glad if you would not refer to her as ‘this girl.’ The\r\nname, if you have forgotten it, is Mariner.”\r\n\r\n“Well, where did you meet Miss Mariner?”\r\n\r\n“At Prince’s.”\r\n\r\n“Restaurant?”\r\n\r\n“Skating-rink,” said Derek impatiently. “Just after you left for\r\nMentone. Freddie Rooke introduced me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your intellectual friend Mr Rooke knows her?”\r\n\r\n“They were children together. Her people lived next to the Rookes in\r\nWorcestershire.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you said she was an American.”\r\n\r\n“I said her father was. He settled in England. Jill hasn’t been in\r\nAmerica since she was eight or nine.”\r\n\r\n“The fact,” said Lady Underhill, “that the girl is a friend of Mr Rooke\r\nis no great recommendation.”\r\n\r\nDerek kicked angrily at a box of matches which someone had thrown down\r\non the platform.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you could possibly get it into your head, mother, that I\r\nwant to marry Jill, not engage her as an under-housemaid. I don’t\r\nconsider that she requires recommendations, as you call them. However,\r\ndon’t you think the most sensible thing is for you to wait till you\r\nmeet her at dinner tonight, and then you can form your own opinion? I’m\r\nbeginning to get a little bored with this futile discussion.”\r\n\r\n“As you seem quite unable to talk on the subject of this girl without\r\nbecoming rude,” said Lady Underhill, “I agree with you. Let us hope\r\nthat my first impression will be a favorable one. Experience has taught\r\nme that first impressions are everything.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you think so,” said Derek, “for I fell in love with Jill the\r\nvery first moment I saw her!”\r\n\r\n§ 4.\r\n\r\nParker stepped back, and surveyed with modest pride the dinner-table to\r\nwhich he had been putting the finishing touches. It was an artistic job\r\nand a credit to him.\r\n\r\n“That’s that!” said Parker, satisfied.\r\n\r\nHe went to the window and looked out. The fog which had lasted well\r\ninto the evening, had vanished now, and the clear night was bright with\r\nstars. A distant murmur of traffic came from the direction of\r\nPiccadilly.\r\n\r\nAs he stood there, the front-door bell rang, and continued to ring in\r\nlittle spurts of sound. If character can be deduced from bell-ringing,\r\nas nowadays it apparently can be from every other form of human\r\nactivity, one might have hazarded the guess that whoever was on the\r\nother side of the door was determined, impetuous, and energetic.\r\n\r\n“Parker!”\r\n\r\nFreddie Rooke pushed a tousled head, which had yet to be brushed into\r\nthe smooth sleekness that made it a delight to the public eye, out of a\r\nroom down the passage.\r\n\r\n“Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Somebody ringing.”\r\n\r\n“I heard, sir. I was about to answer the bell.”\r\n\r\n“If it’s Lady Underhill, tell her I’ll be in in a minute.”\r\n\r\n“I fancy it is Miss Mariner, sir. I think I recognise her touch.”\r\n\r\nHe made his way down the passage to the front-door, and opened it. A\r\ngirl was standing outside. She wore a long gray fur coat, and a filmy\r\ngray hood covered her hair. As Parker opened the door, she scampered in\r\nlike a gray kitten.\r\n\r\n“Brrh! It’s cold!” she exclaimed. “Hullo, Parker!”\r\n\r\n“Good evening, miss.”\r\n\r\n“Am I the last or the first or what?”\r\n\r\nParker moved to help her with her cloak.\r\n\r\n“Sir Derek and her ladyship have not yet arrived, miss. Sir Derek went\r\nto bring her ladyship from the Savoy Hotel. Mr Rooke is dressing in his\r\nbedroom and will be ready very shortly.”\r\n\r\nThe girl had slipped out of the fur coat, and Parker cast a swift\r\nglance of approval at her. He had the valet’s unerring eye for a\r\nthoroughbred, and Jill Mariner was manifestly that. It showed in her\r\nwalk, in every move of her small, active body, in the way she looked at\r\nyou, in the way she talked to you, in the little tilt of her resolute\r\nchin. Her hair was pale gold, and had the brightness of coloring of a\r\nchild’s. Her face glowed, and her gray eyes sparkled. She looked very\r\nmuch alive.\r\n\r\nIt was this aliveness of hers that was her chief charm. Her eyes were\r\ngood and her mouth, with its small, even teeth, attractive, but she\r\nwould have laughed if anybody had called her beautiful. She sometimes\r\ndoubted if she were even pretty. Yet few men had met her and remained\r\nentirely undisturbed. She had a magnetism. One hapless youth, who had\r\nlaid his heart at her feet and had been commanded to pick it up again,\r\nhad endeavored subsequently to explain her attraction (to a bosom\r\nfriend over a mournful bottle of the best in the club smoking-room) in\r\nthese words: “I don’t know what it is about her, old man, but she\r\nsomehow makes a feller feel she’s so damned _interested_ in a chap, if\r\nyou know what I mean.” And, though not generally credited in his circle\r\nwith any great acuteness, there is no doubt that the speaker had\r\nachieved something approaching a true analysis of Jill’s fascination\r\nfor his sex. She was interested in everything Life presented to her\r\nnotice, from a Coronation to a stray cat. She was vivid. She had\r\nsympathy. She listened to you as though you really mattered. It takes a\r\nman of tough fibre to resist these qualities. Women, on the other hand,\r\nespecially of the Lady Underhill type, can resist them without an\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n“Go and stir him up,” said Jill, alluding to the absent Mr Rooke. “Tell\r\nhim to come and talk to me. Where’s the nearest fire? I want to get\r\nright over it and huddle.”\r\n\r\n“The fire’s burning nicely in the sitting-room, miss.”\r\n\r\nJill hurried into the sitting-room, and increased her hold on Parker’s\r\nesteem by exclaiming rapturously at the sight that greeted her. Parker\r\nhad expended time and trouble over the sitting-room. There was no dust,\r\nno untidiness. The pictures all hung straight; the cushions were smooth\r\nand unrumpled; and a fire of exactly the right dimensions burned\r\ncheerfully in the grate, flickering cosily on the small piano by the\r\ncouch, on the deep leather arm-chairs which Freddie had brought with\r\nhim from Oxford, that home of comfortable chairs, and on the\r\nphotographs that studded the walls. In the center of the mantelpiece,\r\nthe place of honor, was the photograph of herself which she had given\r\nDerek a week ago.\r\n\r\n“You’re simply wonderful, Parker! I don’t see how you manage to make a\r\nroom so cosy!” Jill sat down on the club-fender that guarded the\r\nfireplace, and held her hands over the blaze. “I can’t understand why\r\nmen ever marry. Fancy having to give up all this!”\r\n\r\n“I am gratified that you appreciate it, miss. I did my best to make it\r\ncomfortable for you. I fancy I hear Mr Rooke coming now.”\r\n\r\n“I hope the others won’t be long. I’m starving. Has Mrs Parker got\r\nsomething very good for dinner?”\r\n\r\n“She has strained every nerve, miss.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’m sure it’s worth waiting for. Hullo, Freddie.”\r\n\r\nFreddie Rooke, resplendent in evening dress, bustled in, patting his\r\ntie with solicitous fingers. It had been right when he had looked in\r\nthe glass in his bedroom, but you never know about ties. Sometimes they\r\nstay right, sometimes they wiggle up sideways. Life is full of these\r\nanxieties.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t touch it,” said Jill. “It looks beautiful, and, if I may\r\nsay so in confidence, is having a most disturbing effect on my\r\nemotional nature. I’m not at all sure I shall be able to resist it\r\nright through the evening. It isn’t fair of you to try to alienate the\r\naffections of an engaged young person like this.”\r\n\r\nFreddie squinted down, and became calmer.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Jill, old thing. Nobody here yet?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m here,—the petite figure seated on the fender. But perhaps I\r\ndon’t count.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I didn’t mean that, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I should hope not, when I’ve bought a special new dress just to\r\nfascinate you. A creation I mean. When they cost as much as this one\r\ndid, you have to call them names. What do you think of it?”\r\n\r\nFreddie seated himself on another section of the fender, and regarded\r\nher with the eye of an expert. A snappy dresser, as the technical term\r\nis, himself, he appreciated snap in the outer covering of the other\r\nsex.\r\n\r\n“Topping!” he said spaciously. “No other word for it! All wool and a\r\nyard wide! Precisely as mother makes it! You look like a thingummy.”\r\n\r\n“How splendid! All my life I’ve wanted to look like a thingummy, but\r\nsomehow I’ve never been able to manage it.”\r\n\r\n“A wood-nymph!” exclaimed Freddie, in a burst of unwonted imagery.\r\n\r\n“Wood-nymphs didn’t wear creations.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know what I mean!” He looked at her with honest admiration.\r\n“Dash it, Jill, you know, there’s something about you! You’re—what’s\r\nthe word?—you’ve got such small bones!”\r\n\r\n“Ugh! I suppose it’s a compliment, but how horrible it sounds! It makes\r\nme feel like a skeleton.”\r\n\r\n“I mean to say, you’re—you’re dainty!”\r\n\r\n“That’s much better.”\r\n\r\n“You look as if you weighed about an ounce and a half! You look like a\r\nbit of thistledown! You’re a little fairy princess, dash it!”\r\n\r\n“Freddie! This is eloquence!” Jill raised her left hand, and twiddled a\r\nringed finger ostentatiously. “Er—you _do_ realize that I’m bespoke,\r\ndon’t you, and that my heart, alas, is another’s? Because you sound as\r\nif you were going to propose.”\r\n\r\nFreddie produced a snowy handkerchief, and polished his eye-glass.\r\nSolemnity descended on him like a cloud. He looked at Jill with an\r\nearnest, paternal gaze.\r\n\r\n“That reminds me,” he said. “I wanted to have, a bit of a talk with you\r\nabout that—being engaged and all that sort of thing. I’m glad I got you\r\nalone before the Curse arrived.”\r\n\r\n“Curse? Do you mean Derek’s mother? That sounds cheerful and\r\nencouraging.”\r\n\r\n“Well, she is, you know,” said Freddie earnestly. “She’s a bird! It\r\nwould be idle to deny it. She always puts the fear of God into me. I\r\nnever know what to say to her.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you try asking her riddles?”\r\n\r\n“It’s no joking matter,” persisted Freddie, his amiable face overcast.\r\n“Wait till you meet her! You should have seen her at the station this\r\nmorning. You don’t know what you’re up against!”\r\n\r\n“You make my flesh creep, Freddie. What am I up against?”\r\n\r\nFreddie poked the fire scientifically, and assisted it with coal.\r\n\r\n“It’s this way,” he said. “Of course, dear old Derek’s the finest chap\r\nin the world.”\r\n\r\n“I know that,” said Jill softly. She patted Freddie’s hand with a\r\nlittle gesture of gratitude. Freddie’s devotion to Derek was a thing\r\nthat always touched her. She looked thoughtfully into the fire, and her\r\neyes seemed to glow in sympathy with the glowing coals. “There’s nobody\r\nlike him!”\r\n\r\n“But,” continued Freddie, “he always has been frightfully under his\r\nmother’s thumb, you know.”\r\n\r\nJill was conscious of a little flicker of irritation.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be absurd, Freddie. How could a man like Derek be under\r\nanybody’s thumb?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know what I mean!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t in the least know what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, it would be rather rotten if his mother set him against you.”\r\n\r\nJill clenched her teeth. The quick temper which always lurked so very\r\nlittle beneath the surface of her cheerfulness was stirred. She felt\r\nsuddenly chilled and miserable. She tried to tell herself that Freddie\r\nwas just an amiable blunderer who spoke without sense or reason, but it\r\nwas no use. She could not rid herself of a feeling of foreboding and\r\ndiscomfort. It had been the one jarring note in the sweet melody of her\r\nlove-story, this apprehension of Derek’s regarding his mother. The\r\nDerek she loved was a strong man, with a strong man’s contempt for\r\nother people’s criticism; and there had been something ignoble and\r\nfussy in his attitude regarding Lady Underhill. She had tried to feel\r\nthat the flaw in her idol did not exist. And here was Freddie Rooke, a\r\nman who admired Derek with all his hero-worshipping nature, pointing it\r\nout independently. She was annoyed, and she expended her annoyance, as\r\nwomen will do, upon the innocent bystander.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember the time I turned the hose on you, Freddie,” she said,\r\nrising from the fender, “years ago, when we were children, when you and\r\nthat awful Mason boy—what was his name? Wally Mason—teased me?” She\r\nlooked at the unhappy Freddie with a hostile eye. It was his blundering\r\nwords that had spoiled everything. “I’ve forgotten what it was all\r\nabout, but I know that you and Wally infuriated me and I turned the\r\ngarden hose on you and soaked you both to the skin. Well, all I want to\r\npoint out is that, if you go on talking nonsense about Derek and his\r\nmother and me, I shall ask Parker to bring me a jug of water, and I\r\nshall empty it over you! Set him against me! You talk as if love were a\r\nthing any third party could come along and turn off with a tap! Do you\r\nsuppose that, when two people love each other as Derek and I do, that\r\nit can possibly matter in the least what anybody else thinks or says,\r\neven if it is his mother? I haven’t got a mother, but suppose Uncle\r\nChris came and warned me against Derek …”\r\n\r\nHer anger suddenly left her as quickly as it had come. That was always\r\nthe way with Jill. One moment later she would be raging; the next,\r\nsomething would tickle her sense of humor and restore her instantly to\r\ncheerfulness. And the thought of dear, lazy old Uncle Chris taking the\r\ntrouble to warn anybody against anything except the wrong brand of wine\r\nor an inferior make of cigar conjured up a picture before which wrath\r\nmelted away. She chuckled, and Freddie, who had been wilting on the\r\nfender, perked up.\r\n\r\n“You’re an extraordinary girl, Jill! One never knows when you’re going\r\nto get the wind up.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it enough to make me get the wind up, as you call it, when you\r\nsay absurd things like that?”\r\n\r\n“I meant well, old girl!”\r\n\r\n“That’s the trouble with you. You always do mean well. You go about the\r\nworld meaning well till people fly to put themselves under police\r\nprotection. Besides, what on earth could Lady Underhill find to object\r\nto in me? I’ve plenty of money, and I’m one of the most charming and\r\nattractive of Society belles. You needn’t take my word for that, and I\r\ndon’t suppose you’ve noticed it, but that’s what Mr Gossip in the\r\n_Morning Mirror_ called me when he was writing about my getting engaged\r\nto Derek. My maid showed me the clipping. There was quite a long\r\nparagraph, with a picture of me that looked like a Zulu chieftainess\r\ntaken in a coal-cellar during a bad fog. Well, after that, what could\r\nanyone say against me? I’m a perfect prize! I expect Lady Underhill\r\nscreamed with joy when she heard the news and went singing all over her\r\nRiviera villa.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Freddie dubiously. “Yes, yes, oh, quite so, rather!”\r\n\r\nJill looked at him sternly.\r\n\r\n“Freddie, you’re concealing something from me! You _don’t_ think I’m a\r\ncharming and attractive Society belle! Tell me why not and I’ll show\r\nyou where you are wrong. Is it my face you object to, or my manners, or\r\nmy figure? There was a young bride of Antigua, who said to her mate,\r\n‘What a pig you are!’ Said he, ‘Oh, my queen, is it manners you mean,\r\nor do you allude to my fig-u-ar?’ Isn’t my figuar all right, Freddie?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _I_ think you’re topping.”\r\n\r\n“But for some reason you’re afraid that Derek’s mother won’t think so.\r\nWhy won’t Lady Underhill agree with Mr Gossip?”\r\n\r\nFreddie hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Speak up!”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s like this. Remember I’ve known the old devil …”\r\n\r\n“Freddie Rooke! Where do you pick up such expressions? Not from me!”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s how I always think of her! I say I’ve known her ever\r\nsince I used to go and stop at their place when I was at school, and I\r\nknow exactly the sort of things that put her back up. She’s a\r\nwhat-d’you-call-it.”\r\n\r\n“I see no harm in that. Why shouldn’t the dear old lady be a\r\nwhat-d’you-call-it? She must do _something_ in her spare time.”\r\n\r\n“I mean to say, one of the old school, don’t you know. And you’re so\r\ndashed impulsive, old girl. You know you are! You are always saying\r\nthings that come into your head.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t say a thing unless it comes into your head.”\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean,” Freddie went on earnestly, not to be diverted\r\nfrom his theme. “You say rummy things and you do rummy things. What I\r\nmean to say is, you’re impulsive.”\r\n\r\n“What have I ever done that the sternest critic could call rummy?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve seen you with my own eyes stop in the middle of Bond Street\r\nand help a lot of fellows shove along a cart that had got stuck. Mind\r\nyou, I’m not blaming you for it …”\r\n\r\n“I should hope not. The poor old horse was trying all he knew to get\r\ngoing, and he couldn’t quite make it. Naturally, I helped.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know. Very decent and all that, but I doubt if Lady Underhill\r\nwould have thought a lot of it. And you’re so dashed chummy with the\r\nlower orders.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be a snob, Freddie.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not a snob,” protested Freddie, wounded. “When I’m alone with\r\nParker—for instance—I’m as chatty as dammit. But I don’t ask waiters in\r\npublic restaurants how their lumbago is.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever had lumbago?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s a very painful thing, and waiters get it just as badly as\r\ndukes. Worse, I should think, because they’re always bending and\r\nstooping and carrying things. Naturally one feels sorry for them.”\r\n\r\n“But how do you ever find out that a waiter has _got_ lumbago?”\r\n\r\n“I ask him; of course.”\r\n\r\n“Well, for goodness sake,” said Freddie, “if you feel the impulse to do\r\nthat sort of thing tonight, try and restrain it. I mean to say, if\r\nyou’re curious to know anything about Parker’s chilblains, for\r\ninstance, don’t enquire after them while he’s handing Lady Underhill\r\nthe potatoes! She wouldn’t like it.”\r\n\r\nJill uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n“I knew there was something! Being so cold and wanting to rush in and\r\ncrouch over a fire put it clean out of my head. He must be thinking me\r\na perfect beast!” She ran to the door. “Parker! Parker!”\r\n\r\nParker appeared from nowhere.\r\n\r\n“Yes, miss?”\r\n\r\n“I’m so sorry I forgot to ask before. How are your chilblains?”\r\n\r\n“A good deal better, miss, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Did you try the stuff I recommended?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, miss. It did them a world of good.”\r\n\r\n“Splendid!”\r\n\r\nJill went back into the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” she said reassuringly. “They’re better.”\r\n\r\nShe wandered restlessly about the room, looking at the photographs.\r\n\r\n“What a lot of girls you seem to know, Freddie. Are these all the ones\r\nyou’ve loved and lost?” She sat down at the piano and touched the keys.\r\nThe clock on the mantelpiece chimed the half hour. “I wish to goodness\r\nthey would arrive,” she said.\r\n\r\n“They’ll be here pretty soon, I expect.”\r\n\r\n“It’s rather awful,” said Jill, “to think of Lady Underhill racing all\r\nthe way from Mentone to Paris and from Paris to Calais and from Calais\r\nto Dover and from Dover to London simply to inspect me. You can’t\r\nwonder I’m nervous, Freddie.”\r\n\r\nThe eye-glass dropped from Freddie’s eye.\r\n\r\n“Are _you_ nervous?” he asked, astonished.\r\n\r\n“Of course I’m nervous. Wouldn’t you be in my place?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I should never have thought it.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you suppose I’ve been talking such a lot? Why do you imagine I\r\nsnapped your poor, innocent head off just now? I’m terrified inside,\r\nterrified!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t look it, by Jove!”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m trying to be a little warrior. That’s what Uncle Chris always\r\nused to call me. It started the day when he took me to have a tooth\r\nout, when I was ten. ‘Be a little warrior, Jill!’ he kept saying—‘Be a\r\nlittle warrior!’ And I was.” She looked at the clock. “But I shan’t be\r\nif they don’t get here soon. The suspense is awful.” She strummed the\r\nkeys. “Suppose she _doesn’t_ like me, Freddie! You see how you’ve\r\nscared me.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say she wouldn’t. I only said you’d got to watch out a bit.”\r\n\r\n“Something tells me she won’t. My nerve is oozing out of me.” Jill\r\nshook her head impatiently. “It’s all so vulgar! I thought this sort of\r\nthing only happened in the comic papers and in music-hall songs. Why,\r\nit’s just like that song somebody used to sing.” She laughed. “Do you\r\nremember? I don’t know how the verse went, but …\r\n\r\nJohn took me round to see his mother,\r\n                    his mother,\r\n                    his mother!\r\nAnd when he’d introduced us to each other,\r\n    She sized up everything that I had on.\r\nShe put me through a cross-examination:\r\nI fairly boiled with aggravation:\r\n    Then she shook her head,\r\n    Looked at me and said:\r\n        ‘Poor John! Poor John!’\r\n\r\n\r\n“Chorus, Freddie! Let’s cheer ourselves up! We need it!”\r\n\r\n‘John took me round to see his mother … !\r\n\r\n\r\n“His mo-o-o-other!” croaked Freddie. Curiously enough, this ballad was\r\none of Freddie’s favorites. He had rendered it with a good deal of\r\nsuccess on three separate occasions at village entertainments down in\r\nWorcestershire, and he rather flattered himself that he could get about\r\nas much out of it as the next man. He proceeded to abet Jill heartily\r\nwith gruff sounds which he was under the impression constituted what is\r\nknown in musical circles as “singing seconds.”\r\n\r\n“His mo-o-o-other!” he growled with frightful scorn.\r\n\r\n“And when she’d introduced us to each other …”\r\n\r\n“O-o-o-other!”\r\n\r\n“She sized up everything that I had on!”\r\n\r\n“Pom-pom-pom!”\r\n\r\n“She put me through a cross-examination …”\r\n\r\nJill had thrown her head back, and was singing jubilantly at the top of\r\nher voice. The appositeness of the song had cheered her up. It seemed\r\nsomehow to make her forebodings rather ridiculous, to reduce them to\r\nabsurdity, to turn into farce the gathering tragedy which had been\r\nweighing upon her nerves.\r\n\r\n“Then she shook her head,\r\nLooked at me and said:\r\n        ‘Poor John!’…”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Jill,” said a voice at the door. “I want you to meet my mother!”\r\n\r\n“Poo-oo-oor John!” bleated the hapless Freddie, unable to check\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Dinner,” said Parker the valet, appearing at the door and breaking a\r\nsilence that seemed to fill the room like a tangible presence, “is\r\nserved!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nThe front-door closed softly behind the theatre-party. Dinner was over,\r\nand Parker had just been assisting the expedition out of the place.\r\nSensitive to atmosphere, he had found his share in the dinner a little\r\ntrying. It had been a strained meal, and what he liked was a clatter of\r\nconversation and everybody having a good time and enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\n“Ellen!” called Parker, as he proceeded down the passage to the empty\r\ndining-room. “Ellen!”\r\n\r\nMrs Parker appeared out of the kitchen, wiping her hands. Her work for\r\nthe evening, like her husband’s, was over. Presently what is\r\ntechnically called a “useful girl” would come in to wash the dishes,\r\nleaving the evening free for social intercourse. Mrs Parker had done\r\nwell by her patrons that night, and now she wanted a quiet chat with\r\nParker over a glass of Freddie Rooke’s port.\r\n\r\n“Have they gone, Horace?” she asked, following him into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nParker selected a cigar from Freddie’s humidor, crackled it against his\r\near, smelt it, clipped off the end, and lit it. He took the decanter\r\nand filled his wife’s glass, then mixed himself a whisky-and-soda.\r\n\r\n“Happy days!” said Parker. “Yes, they’ve gone!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t see her ladyship.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t miss much! A nasty, dangerous specimen, _she_ is! ‘Always\r\nmerry and bright’, I don’t think. I wish you’d have had my job of\r\nwaiting on ’em, Ellen, and me been the one to stay in the kitchen safe\r\nout of it all. That’s all I say! It’s no treat to _me_ to ‘and the\r\ndishes when the atmosphere’s what you might call electric. I didn’t\r\nenvy them that vol-au-vent of yours, Ellen, good as it smelt. Better a\r\ndinner of ’erbs where love is than a stalled ox and ’atred therewith,”\r\nsaid Parker, helping himself to a walnut.\r\n\r\n“Did they have words?”\r\n\r\nParker shook his head impatiently.\r\n\r\n“That sort don’t have words, Ellen. They just sit and goggle.”\r\n\r\n“How did her ladyship seem to hit it off with Miss Mariner, Horace?”\r\n\r\nParker uttered a dry laugh.\r\n\r\n“Ever seen a couple of strange dogs watching each other sort of wary?\r\nThat was them! Not that Miss Mariner wasn’t all that was pleasant and\r\nnice-spoken. She’s all right, Miss Mariner is. She’s a little queen! It\r\nwasn’t her fault the dinner you’d took so much trouble over was more\r\nlike an evening in the Morgue than a Christian dinner-party. She tried\r\nto help things along best she could. But what with Sir Derek chewing\r\nhis lip ’alf the time and his mother acting about as matey as a\r\npennorth of ice-cream, she didn’t have a chance. As for the\r\nguv’nor,—well, I wish you could have seen him, that’s all. You know,\r\nEllen, sometimes I’m not altogether easy in my mind about the guv’nor’s\r\nmental balance. He knows how to buy cigars, and you tell me his port is\r\ngood—I never touch it myself—but sometimes he seems to me to go right\r\noff his onion. Just sat there, he did, all through dinner, looking as\r\nif he expected the good food to rise up and bite him in the face, and\r\njumping nervous when I spoke to him. It’s not my fault,” said Parker,\r\naggrieved. “_I_ can’t give gentlemen warning before I ask ’em if\r\nthey’ll have sherry or hock. I can’t ring a bell or toot a horn to show\r\n’em I’m coming. It’s my place to bend over and whisper in their ear,\r\nand they’ve no right to leap about in their seats and make me spill\r\ngood wine. (You’ll see the spot close by where you’re sitting, Ellen.\r\nJogged my wrist, he did!) I’d like to know why people in the spear of\r\nlife which these people are in can’t behave themselves rational, same\r\nas we do. When we were walking out and I took you to have tea with my\r\nmother, it was one of the pleasantest meals I ever ate. Talk about\r\n’armony! It was a love-feast!”\r\n\r\n“Your ma and I took to each other right from the start, Horace,” said\r\nMrs Parker softly—“That’s the difference.”\r\n\r\n“Well, any woman with any sense would take to Miss Mariner. If I told\r\nyou how near I came to spilling the sauce-boat accidentally over that\r\nold fossil’s head, you’d be surprised, Ellen. She just sat there\r\nbrooding like an old eagle. If you ask my opinion, Miss Mariner’s a\r\nlong sight too good for her precious son!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but Horace! Sir Derek’s a baronet!”\r\n\r\n“What of it? Kind ’earts are more than coronets and simple faith than\r\nNorman blood, aren’t they?”\r\n\r\n“You’re talking Socialism, Horace.”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not. I’m talking sense. I don’t know who Miss Mariner’s\r\nparents may have been—I never enquired—but anyone can see she’s a lady\r\nborn and bred. But do you suppose the path of true love is going to run\r\nsmooth, for all that? Not it! She’s got a ’ard time ahead of her, that\r\npoor girl.”\r\n\r\n“Horace!” Mrs Parker’s gentle heart was wrung. The situation hinted at\r\nby her husband was no new one—indeed, it formed the basis of at least\r\nfifty per cent of the stories in the True Heart Novelette Series, of\r\nwhich she was a determined reader—but it had never failed to touch her.\r\n“Do you think her ladyship means to come between them and wreck their\r\nromance?”\r\n\r\n“I think she means to have a jolly good try.”\r\n\r\n“But Sir Derek has his own money, hasn’t he? I mean, it’s not like when\r\nSir Courtenay Travers fell in love with the milk-maid and was dependent\r\non his mother, the Countess, for everything. Sir Derek can afford to do\r\nwhat he pleases, can’t he?”\r\n\r\nParker shook his head tolerantly. The excellence of the cigar and the\r\nsoothing qualities of the whisky-and-soda had worked upon him, and he\r\nwas feeling less ruffled.\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand these things,” he said. “Women like her ladyship\r\ncan talk a man into anything and out of anything. I wouldn’t care, only\r\nyou can see the poor girl is mad over the feller. What she finds\r\nattractive in him, I can’t say, but that’s her own affair.”\r\n\r\n“He’s very handsome, Horace, with those flashing eyes and that stern\r\nmouth,” argued Mrs Parker.\r\n\r\nParker sniffed.\r\n\r\n“Have it your own way,” he said. “It’s no treat to _me_ to see his eyes\r\nflash, and if he’d put that stern mouth of his to some better use than\r\nadvising the guv’nor to lock up the cigars and trouser the key, I’d be\r\nbetter pleased. If there’s one thing I can’t stand,” said Parker, “it’s\r\nnot to be trusted!” He lifted his cigar and looked at it censoriously.\r\n“I thought so! Burning all down one side. They will do that if you\r\nlight ’em careless. Oh, well,” he continued, rising and going to the\r\nhumidor, “there’s plenty more where that came from. Out of evil cometh\r\ngood,” said Parker philosophically. “If the guv’nor hadn’t been in such\r\na overwrought state tonight, he’d have remembered not to leave the key\r\nin the key-hole. Help yourself to another glass of port, Ellen, and\r\nlet’s enjoy ourselves!”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers how full of his own troubles, how weighed down with\r\nthe problems of his own existence the average playgoer generally is\r\nwhen he enters a theatre, it is remarkable that dramatists ever find it\r\npossible to divert and entertain whole audiences for a space of several\r\nhours. As regards at least three of those who had assembled to witness\r\nits opening performance, the author of “Tried by Fire,” at the\r\nLeicester Theater, undoubtedly had his work cut out for him.\r\n\r\nIt has perhaps been sufficiently indicated by the remarks of Parker,\r\nthe valet, that the little dinner at Freddie Rooke’s had not been an\r\nunqualified success. Searching the records for an adequately gloomy\r\nparallel to the taxi-cab journey to the theatre which followed it, one\r\ncan only think of Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow. And yet even that was\r\nprobably not conducted in dead silence. There must have been moments\r\nwhen Murat got off a good thing or Ney said something worth hearing\r\nabout the weather.\r\n\r\nThe only member of the party who was even remotely happy was, curiously\r\nenough, Freddie Rooke. Originally Freddie had obtained three tickets\r\nfor “Tried by Fire.” The unexpected arrival of Lady Underhill had\r\nobliged him to buy a fourth, separated by several rows from the other\r\nthree. This, as he had told Derek at breakfast, was the seat he\r\nproposed to occupy himself.\r\n\r\nIt consoles the philosopher in this hard world to reflect that, even if\r\nman is born to sorrow as the sparks fly upwards, it is still possible\r\nfor small things to make him happy. The thought of being several rows\r\naway from Lady Underhill had restored Freddie’s equanimity like a\r\ntonic. It thrilled him like the strains of some grand, sweet anthem all\r\nthe way to the theatre. If Freddie Rooke had been asked at that moment\r\nto define happiness in a few words, he would have replied that it\r\nconsisted in being several rows away from Lady Underhill.\r\n\r\nThe theatre was nearly full when Freddie’s party arrived. The Leicester\r\nTheatre had been rented for the season by the newest theatrical knight,\r\nSir Chester Portwood, who had a large following; and, whatever might be\r\nthe fate of the play in the final issue, it would do at least one\r\nnight’s business. The stalls were ablaze with jewelry and crackling\r\nwith starched shirt-fronts; and expensive scents pervaded the air,\r\nputting up a stiff battle with the plebeian peppermint that emanated\r\nfrom the pit. The boxes were filled, and up in the gallery grim-faced\r\npatrons of the drama, who had paid their shillings at the door and\r\nintended to get a shilling’s-worth of entertainment in return, sat and\r\nwaited stolidly for the curtain to rise.\r\n\r\nFirst nights at the theatre always excited Jill. The depression induced\r\nby absorbing nourishment and endeavouring to make conversation in the\r\npresence of Lady Underhill left her. The worst, she told herself, had\r\nhappened. She had met Derek’s mother, and Derek’s mother plainly\r\ndisliked her. Well, that, as Parker would have said, was that. Now she\r\njust wanted to enjoy herself. She loved the theatre. The stir, the buzz\r\nof conversation, the warmth and life of it, all touched a chord in her\r\nwhich made depression impossible.\r\n\r\nThe lights shot up beyond the curtain. The house-lights dimmed.\r\nConversation ceased. The curtain rose. Jill wriggled herself\r\ncomfortably into her seat, and slipped her hand into Derek’s. She felt\r\na glow of happiness as it closed over hers. All, she told herself, was\r\nright with the world.\r\n\r\nAll, that is to say, except the drama which was unfolding on the stage.\r\nIt was one of those plays which start wrong and never recover. By the\r\nend of the first ten minutes there had spread through the theatre that\r\nuneasy feeling which comes over the audience at an opening performance\r\nwhen it realises that it is going to be bored. A sort of lethargy had\r\ngripped the stalls. The dress-circle was coughing. Up in the gallery\r\nthere was grim silence.\r\n\r\nSir Chester Portwood was an actor-manager who had made his reputation\r\nin light comedy of the tea-cup school. His numerous admirers attended a\r\nfirst night at his theatre in a mood of comfortable anticipation,\r\nassured of something pleasant and frothy with a good deal of bright\r\ndialogue and not too much plot. Tonight he seemed to have fallen a\r\nvictim to that spirit of ambition which intermittently attacks\r\nactor-managers of his class, expressing itself in an attempt to prove\r\nthat, having established themselves securely as light comedians, they\r\ncan, like the lady reciter, turn right around and be serious. The one\r\nthing which the London public felt that it was safe from in a Portwood\r\nplay was heaviness, and “Tried by Fire” was grievously heavy. It was a\r\npoetic drama, and the audience, though loth to do anybody an injustice,\r\nwas beginning to suspect that it was written in blank verse.\r\n\r\nThe acting did nothing to dispel the growing uneasiness. Sir Chester\r\nhimself, apparently oppressed by the weightiness of the occasion and\r\nthe responsibility of offering an unfamiliar brand of goods to his\r\npublic, had dropped his customary debonair method of delivering lines\r\nand was mouthing his speeches. It was good gargling, but bad elocution.\r\nAnd, for some reason best known to himself, he had entrusted the role\r\nof the heroine to a doll-like damsel with a lisp, of whom the audience\r\ndisapproved sternly from her initial entrance.\r\n\r\nIt was about half-way through the first act that Jill, whose attention\r\nhad begun to wander, heard a soft groan at her side. The seats which\r\nFreddie Rooke had bought were at the extreme end of the seventh row.\r\nThere was only one other seat in the row, and, as Derek had placed his\r\nmother on his left and was sitting between her and Jill, the latter had\r\nthis seat on her right. It had been empty at the rise of the curtain,\r\nbut in the past few minutes a man had slipped silently into it. The\r\ndarkness prevented Jill from seeing his face, but it was plain that he\r\nwas suffering, and her sympathy went out to him. His opinion of the\r\nplay so obviously coincided with her own.\r\n\r\nPresently the first act ended, and the lights went up. There was a\r\nspatter of insincere applause from the stalls, echoed in the\r\ndress-circle. It grew fainter in the upper circle, and did not reach\r\nthe gallery at all.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Jill to Derek. “What do you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“Too awful for words,” said Derek sternly.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward to join in the conversation which had started between\r\nLady Underhill and some friends she had discovered in the seats in\r\nfront; and Jill, turning, became aware that the man on her right was\r\nlooking at her intently. He was a big man with rough, wiry hair and a\r\nhumorous mouth. His age appeared to be somewhere in the middle\r\ntwenties. Jill, in the brief moment in which their eyes met, decided\r\nthat he was ugly, but with an ugliness that was rather attractive. He\r\nreminded her of one of those large, loose, shaggy dogs that break\r\nthings in drawing-rooms but make admirable companions for the open\r\nroad. She had a feeling that he would look better in tweeds in a field\r\nthan in evening dress in a theatre. He had nice eyes. She could not\r\ndistinguish their color, but they were frank and friendly.\r\n\r\nAll this Jill noted with her customary quickness, and then she looked\r\naway. For an instant she had had an odd feeling that somewhere she had\r\nmet this man or somebody very like him before, but the impression\r\nvanished. She also had the impression that he was still looking at her,\r\nbut she gazed demurely in front of her and did not attempt to verify\r\nthe suspicion.\r\n\r\nBetween them, as they sat side by side, there inserted itself suddenly\r\nthe pinkly remorseful face of Freddie Rooke. Freddie, having skirmished\r\nwarily in the aisle until it was clear that Lady Underhill’s attention\r\nwas engaged elsewhere, had occupied a seat in the row behind which had\r\nbeen left vacant temporarily by an owner who liked refreshment between\r\nthe acts. Freddie was feeling deeply ashamed of himself. He felt that\r\nhe had perpetrated a bloomer of no slight magnitude.\r\n\r\n“I’m awfully sorry about this,” he said penitently. “I mean, roping you\r\nin to listen to this frightful tosh! When I think I might have got\r\nseats just as well for any one of half a dozen topping musical\r\ncomedies, I feel like kicking myself with some vim. But, honestly, how\r\nwas I to know? I never dreamed we were going to be let in for anything\r\nof this sort. Portwood’s plays are usually so dashed bright and snappy\r\nand all that. Can’t think what he was doing, putting on a thing like\r\nthis. Why, it’s blue round the edges!”\r\n\r\nThe man on Jill’s right laughed sharply.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” he said, “the chump who wrote the piece got away from the\r\nasylum long enough to put up the money to produce it.”\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing that startles the well-bred Londoner and throws\r\nhim off his balance, it is to be addressed unexpectedly by a stranger.\r\nFreddie’s sense of decency was revolted. A voice from the tomb could\r\nhardly have shaken him more. All the traditions to which he had been\r\nbrought up had gone to solidify his belief that this was one of things\r\nwhich didn’t happen. Absolutely it wasn’t done. During an earthquake or\r\na shipwreck and possibly on the Day of Judgment, yes. But only then. At\r\nother times, unless they wanted a match or the time or something,\r\nchappies did not speak to fellows to whom they had not been introduced.\r\nHe was far too amiable to snub the man, but to go on with this\r\ndegrading scene was out of the question. There was nothing for it but\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n“Oh, ah, yes,” he mumbled. “Well,” he added to Jill, “I suppose I may\r\nas well be toddling back. See you later and so forth.”\r\n\r\nAnd with a faint ‘Good-bye-ee!’ Freddie removed himself, thoroughly\r\nunnerved.\r\n\r\nJill looked out of the corner of her eye at Derek. He was still\r\noccupied with the people in front. She turned to the man on her right.\r\nShe was not the slave to etiquette that Freddie was. She was much too\r\ninterested in life to refrain from speaking to strangers.\r\n\r\n“You shocked him!” she said, dimpling.\r\n\r\n“Yes. It broke Freddie all up, didn’t it!”\r\n\r\nIt was Jill’s turn to be startled. She looked at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Freddie?”\r\n\r\n“That _was_ Freddie Rooke, wasn’t it? Surely I wasn’t mistaken?”\r\n\r\n“But—do you know him? He didn’t seem to know you.”\r\n\r\n“These are life’s tragedies. He has forgotten me. My boyhood friend!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you were at school with him?”\r\n\r\n“No. Freddie went to Winchester, if I remember. I was at Haileybury.\r\nOur acquaintance was confined to the holidays. My people lived near his\r\npeople in Worcestershire.”\r\n\r\n“Worcestershire!” Jill leaned forward excitedly. “But _I_ used to live\r\nnear Freddie in Worcestershire myself when I was small. I knew him\r\nthere when he was a boy. We must have met!”\r\n\r\n“We met all right.”\r\n\r\nJill wrinkled her forehead. That odd familiar look was in his eyes\r\nagain. But memory failed to respond. She shook her head.\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember you,” she said. “I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind. Perhaps the recollection would have been painful.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean, painful?”\r\n\r\n“Well, looking back, I can see that I must have been a very unpleasant\r\nchild. I have always thought it greatly to the credit of my parents\r\nthat they let me grow up. It would have been so easy to have dropped\r\nsomething heavy on me out of a window. They must have been tempted a\r\nhundred times, but they refrained. Yes, I was a great pest around the\r\nhome. My only redeeming point was the way I worshipped _you_!”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. You probably didn’t notice it at the time, for I had a\r\ncurious way of expressing my adoration. But you remain the brightest\r\nmemory of a checkered youth.”\r\n\r\nJill searched his face with grave eyes, then shook her head again.\r\n“Nothing stirs?” asked the man sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“It’s too maddening! Why does one forget things?” She reflected. “You\r\naren’t Bobby Morrison?”\r\n\r\n“I am not. What is more, I never was!”\r\n\r\nJill dived into the past once more and emerged with another\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\n“Or Charlie—Charlie what was it?—Charlie Field?”\r\n\r\n“You wound me! Have you forgotten that Charlie Field wore velvet Lord\r\nFauntleroy suits and long golden curls? My past is not smirched with\r\nanything like that.”\r\n\r\n“Would I remember your name if you told me?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I’ve forgotten yours. Your surname, that is. Of course I\r\nremember that your Christian name was Jill. It has always seemed to me\r\nthe prettiest monosyllable in the language.” He looked at her\r\nthoughtfully. “It’s odd how little you’ve altered in looks. Freddie’s\r\njust the same, too, only larger. And he didn’t wear an eye-glass in\r\nthose days, though I can see he was bound to later on. And yet I’ve\r\nchanged so much that you can’t place me. It shows what a wearing life I\r\nmust have led. I feel like Rip van Winkle. Old and withered. But that\r\nmay be just the result of watching this play.”\r\n\r\n“It is pretty terrible, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Worse than that. Looking at it dispassionately, I find it the extreme,\r\nragged, outermost edge of the limit. Freddie had the correct\r\ndescription of it. He’s a great critic.”\r\n\r\n“I really do think it’s the worst thing I have ever seen.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what plays you have seen, but I feel you’re right.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the second act’s better,” said Jill optimistically.\r\n\r\n“It’s worse. I know that sounds like boasting, but it’s true. I feel\r\nlike getting up and making a public apology.”\r\n\r\n“But … Oh!”\r\n\r\nJill turned scarlet. A monstrous suspicion had swept over her.\r\n\r\n“The only trouble is,” went on her companion, “that the audience would\r\nundoubtedly lynch me. And, though it seems improbable just at the\r\npresent moment, it may be that life holds some happiness for me that’s\r\nworth waiting for. Anyway I’d rather not be torn limb from limb. A\r\nmessy finish! I can just see them rending me asunder in a spasm of\r\nperfectly justifiable fury. ‘She loves me!’ Off comes a leg. ‘She loves\r\nme not!’ Off comes an arm. No, I think on the whole I’ll lie low.\r\nBesides, why should I care? Let ’em suffer. It’s their own fault. They\r\n_would_ come!”\r\n\r\nJill had been trying to interrupt the harangue. She was greatly\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n“Did you _write_ the play?”\r\n\r\nThe man nodded.\r\n\r\n“You are quite right to speak in that horrified tone. But, between\r\nourselves and on the understanding that you don’t get up and denounce\r\nme, I did.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m so sorry!”\r\n\r\n“Not half so sorry as I am, believe me!”\r\n\r\n“I mean, I wouldn’t have said …”\r\n\r\n“Never mind. You didn’t tell me anything I didn’t know.” The lights\r\nbegan to go down. He rose. “Well, they’re off again. Perhaps you will\r\nexcuse me? I don’t feel quite equal to assisting any longer at the\r\nwake. If you want something to occupy your mind during the next act,\r\ntry to remember my name.”\r\n\r\nHe slid from his seat and disappeared. Jill clutched at Derek.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Derek, it’s too awful. I’ve just been talking to the man who wrote\r\nthis play, and I told him it was the worst thing I had ever seen!”\r\n\r\n“Did you?” Derek snorted. “Well, it’s about time somebody told him!” A\r\nthought seemed to strike him. “Why, who is he? I didn’t know you knew\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t. I don’t even know his name.”\r\n\r\n“His name, according to the programme, is John Grant. Never heard of\r\nhim before. Jill, I wish you would not talk to people you don’t know,”\r\nsaid Derek with a note of annoyance in his voice. “You can never tell\r\nwho they are.”\r\n\r\n“But …”\r\n\r\n“Especially with my mother here. You must be more careful.”\r\n\r\nThe curtain rose. Jill saw the stage mistily. From childhood up, she\r\nhad never been able to cure herself of an unfortunate sensitiveness\r\nwhen sharply spoken to by those she loved. A rebuking world she could\r\nface with a stout heart, but there had always been just one or two\r\npeople whose lightest word of censure could crush her. Her father had\r\nalways had that effect upon her, and now Derek had taken his place.\r\n\r\nBut if there had only been time to explain … Derek could not object to\r\nher chatting with a friend of her childhood, even if she had completely\r\nforgotten him and did not remember his name even now. John Grant?\r\nMemory failed to produce any juvenile John Grant for her inspection.\r\n\r\nPuzzling over this problem, Jill missed much of the beginning of the\r\nsecond act. Hers was a detachment which the rest of the audience would\r\ngladly have shared. For the poetic drama, after a bad start, was now\r\nplunging into worse depths of dulness. The coughing had become almost\r\ncontinuous. The stalls, supported by the presence of large droves of\r\nSir Chester’s personal friends, were struggling gallantly to maintain a\r\nsemblance of interest, but the pit and gallery had plainly given up\r\nhope. The critic of a weekly paper of small circulation, who had been\r\nshoved up in the upper circle, grimly jotted down the phrase\r\n“apathetically received” on his programme. He had come to the theatre\r\nthat night in an aggrieved mood, for managers usually put him in the\r\ndress-circle. He got out his pencil again. Another phrase had occurred\r\nto him, admirable for the opening of his article. “At the Leicester\r\nTheatre,” he wrote, “where Sir Chester Portwood presented ‘Tried by\r\nFire,’ dulness reigned supreme. …”\r\n\r\nBut you never know. Call no evening dull till it is over. However\r\nuninteresting its early stages may have been, that night was to be as\r\nanimated and exciting as any audience could desire,—a night to be\r\nlooked back to and talked about. For just as the critic of _London\r\nGossip_ wrote those damning words on his programme, guiding his pencil\r\nuncertainly in the dark, a curious yet familiar odor stole over the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe stalls got it first, and sniffed. It rose to the dress-circle, and\r\nthe dress-circle sniffed. Floating up, it smote the silent gallery.\r\nAnd, suddenly, coming to life with a single-minded abruptness, the\r\ngallery ceased to be silent.\r\n\r\n“Fire!”\r\n\r\nSir Chester Portwood, ploughing his way through a long speech, stopped\r\nand looked apprehensively over his shoulder. The girl with the lisp,\r\nwho had been listening in a perfunctory manner to the long speech,\r\nscreamed loudly. The voice of an unseen stage-hand called thunderously\r\nto an invisible “Bill” to cummere quick. And from the scenery on the\r\nprompt side there curled lazily across the stage a black wisp of smoke.\r\n\r\n“Fire! Fire! Fire!”\r\n\r\n“Just,” said a voice at Jill’s elbow, “what the play needed!” The\r\nmysterious author was back in his seat again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nIn these days when the authorities who watch over the welfare of the\r\ncommunity have taken the trouble to reiterate encouragingly in printed\r\nnotices that a full house can be emptied in three minutes and that all\r\nan audience has to do in an emergency is to walk, not run, to the\r\nnearest exit, fire in the theatre has lost a good deal of its old-time\r\nterror. Yet it would be paltering with the truth to say that the\r\naudience which had assembled to witness the opening performance of the\r\nnew play at the Leicester was entirely at its ease. The asbestos\r\ncurtain was already on its way down, which should have been reassuring:\r\nbut then asbestos curtains never look the part. To the lay eye they\r\nseem just the sort of thing that will blaze quickest. Moreover, it had\r\nnot yet occurred to the man at the switchboard to turn up the\r\nhouse-lights, and the darkness was disconcerting.\r\n\r\nPortions of the house were taking the thing better than other portions.\r\nUp in the gallery a vast activity was going on. The clatter of feet\r\nalmost drowned the shouting. A moment before it would have seemed\r\nincredible that anything could have made the occupants of the gallery\r\nanimated, but the instinct of self-preservation had put new life into\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe stalls had not yet entirely lost their self-control. Alarm was in\r\nthe air, but for the moment they hung on the razor-edge between panic\r\nand dignity. Panic urged them to do something sudden and energetic:\r\ndignity counselled them to wait. They, like the occupants of the\r\ngallery, greatly desired to be outside, but it was bad form to rush and\r\njostle. The men were assisting the women into their cloaks, assuring\r\nthem the while that it was “all right” and that they must not be\r\nfrightened. But another curl of smoke had crept out just before the\r\nasbestos curtain completed its descent, and their words lacked the ring\r\nof conviction. The movement towards the exits had not yet become a\r\nstampede, but already those with seats nearest the stage had begun to\r\nfeel that the more fortunate individuals near the doors were infernally\r\nslow in removing themselves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as if by mutual inspiration, the composure of the stalls\r\nbegan to slip. Looking from above, one could have seen a sort of\r\nshudder run through the crowd. It was the effect of every member of\r\nthat crowd starting to move a little more quickly.\r\n\r\nA hand grasped Jill’s arm. It was a comforting hand, the hand of a man\r\nwho had not lost his head. A pleasant voice backed up its message of\r\nreassurance.\r\n\r\n“It’s no good getting into that mob. You might get hurt. There’s no\r\ndanger: the play isn’t going on.”\r\n\r\nJill was shaken: but she had the fighting spirit and hated to show that\r\nshe was shaken. Panic was knocking at the door of her soul, but dignity\r\nrefused to be dislodged.\r\n\r\n“All the same,” she said, smiling a difficult smile, “it would be nice\r\nto get out, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I was just going to suggest something of that very sort,” said the man\r\nbeside her. “The same thought occurred to me. We can stroll out quite\r\ncomfortably by our own private route. Come along.”\r\n\r\nJill looked over her shoulder. Derek and Lady Underhill were merged\r\ninto the mass of refugees. She could not see them. For an instant a\r\nlittle spasm of pique stung her at the thought that Derek had deserted\r\nher. She groped her way after her companion, and presently they came by\r\nway of a lower box to the iron pass-door leading to the stage.\r\n\r\nAs it opened, smoke blew through, and the smell of burning was\r\nformidable. Jill recoiled involuntarily.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” said her companion. “It smells worse than it really\r\nis. And, anyway, this is the quickest way out.”\r\n\r\nThey passed through onto the stage, and found themselves in a world of\r\nnoise and confusion compared with which the auditorium which they had\r\nleft had been a peaceful place. Smoke was everywhere. A stage-hand,\r\ncarrying a bucket, lurched past them, bellowing. From somewhere out of\r\nsight on the other side of the stage there came a sound of chopping.\r\nJill’s companion moved quickly to the switchboard, groped, found a\r\nhandle, and turned it. In the narrow space between the corner of the\r\nproscenium and the edge of the asbestos curtain lights flashed up: and\r\nsimultaneously there came a sudden diminution of the noise from the\r\nbody of the house. The stalls, snatched from the intimidating spell of\r\nthe darkness and able to see each other’s faces, discovered that they\r\nhad been behaving indecorously and checked their struggling, a little\r\nashamed of themselves. The relief would be only momentary, but, while\r\nit lasted, it postponed panic.\r\n\r\n“Go straight across the stage,” Jill heard her companion say, “out\r\nalong the passage and turn to the right, and you’ll be at the\r\nstage-door. I think, as there seems no one else around to do it, I’d\r\nbetter go out and say a few soothing words to the customers. Otherwise\r\nthey’ll be biting holes in each other.”\r\n\r\nHe squeezed through the narrow opening in front of the curtain.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen!”\r\n\r\nJill remained where she was, leaning with one hand against the\r\nswitchboard. She made no attempt to follow the directions he had given\r\nher. She was aware of a sense of comradeship, of being with this man in\r\nthis adventure. If he stayed, she must stay. To go now through the\r\nsafety of the stage-door would be abominable desertion. She listened,\r\nand found that she could hear plainly in spite of the noise. The smoke\r\nwas worse than ever, and hurt her eyes, so that the figures of the\r\ntheatre-firemen, hurrying to and fro, seemed like Brocken specters. She\r\nslipped a corner of her cloak across her mouth, and was able to breathe\r\nmore easily.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen, I assure you that there is absolutely no danger.\r\nI am a stranger to you, so there is no reason why you should take my\r\nword, but fortunately I can give you solid proof. If there were any\r\ndanger, _I_ wouldn’t be here. All that has happened is that the warmth\r\nof your reception of the play has set a piece of scenery alight. …”\r\n\r\nA crimson-faced stage-hand, carrying an axe in blackened hands, roared\r\nin Jill’s ear.\r\n\r\n“Gerroutofit!”\r\n\r\nJill looked at him, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“’Op it!” shouted the stage-hand. He cast his axe down with a clatter.\r\n“Can’t you see the place is afire?”\r\n\r\n“But—but I’m waiting for …” Jill pointed to where her ally was still\r\naddressing an audience that seemed reluctant to stop and listen to him.\r\n\r\nThe stage-hand squinted out round the edge of the curtain.\r\n\r\n“If he’s a friend of yours, miss, kindly get ’im to cheese it and get a\r\nmove on. We’re clearing out. There’s nothing we can do. It’s got too\r\nmuch of an ’old. In about another two ticks the roof’s going to drop on\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nJill’s friend came squeezing back through the opening.\r\n\r\n“Hullo! Still here?” He blinked approvingly at her through the smoke.\r\n“You’re a little soldier! Well, Augustus, what’s on your mind?” The\r\nsimple question seemed to take the stage-hand aback.\r\n\r\n“Wot’s on my mind? I’ll tell you wot’s on my blinking mind …”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me. Let me guess. I’ve got it! The place is on fire!”\r\n\r\nThe stage-hand expectorated disgustedly. Flippancy at such a moment\r\noffended his sensibilities.\r\n\r\n“We’re ’opping it,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Great minds think alike! _We_ are hopping it, too.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better! And damn quick!”\r\n\r\n“And, as you suggest, damn quick! You think of everything!”\r\n\r\nJill followed him across the stage. Her heart was beating violently.\r\nThere was not only smoke now, but heat. Across the stage little scarlet\r\nflames were shooting, and something large and hard, unseen through the\r\nsmoke, fell with a crash. The air was heavy with the smell of burning\r\npaint.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Sir Portwood Chester?” enquired her companion of the\r\nstage-hand, who hurried beside them.\r\n\r\n“’Opped it!” replied the other briefly, and coughed raspingly as he\r\nswallowed smoke.\r\n\r\n“Strange,” said the man in Jill’s ear, as he pulled her along. “This\r\nway. Stick to me. Strange how the drama anticipates life! At the end of\r\nact two there was a scene where Sir Chester had to creep sombrely out\r\ninto the night, and now he’s gone and done it! Ah!”\r\n\r\nThey had stumbled through a doorway and were out in a narrow passage,\r\nwhere the air, though tainted, was comparatively fresh. Jill drew a\r\ndeep breath. Her companion turned to the stage-hand and felt in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n“Here, Rollo!” A coin changed hands. “Go and get a drink. You need it\r\nafter all this.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it. You’ve saved our lives. Suppose you hadn’t come up\r\nand told us, and we had never noticed there was a fire! Charred bones,\r\nbelieved to be those of a man and a woman, were found in the ruined\r\nedifice!”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Jill. “Here’s the stage-door. Shall we creep sombrely out\r\ninto the night?”\r\n\r\nThe guardian of the stage-door was standing in the entrance of his\r\nlittle hutch, plainly perplexed. He was a slow thinker and a man whose\r\nlife was ruled by routine: and the events of the evening had left him\r\nuncertain how to act.\r\n\r\n“Wot’s all this about a fire?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nJill’s friend stopped.\r\n\r\n“A fire?” He looked at Jill. “Did _you_ hear anything about a fire?”\r\n\r\n“They all come bustin’ past ’ere yelling there’s a fire,” persisted the\r\ndoor-man.\r\n\r\n“By George! Now I come to think of it, you’re perfectly right! There\r\n_is_ a fire! If you wait here a little longer, you’ll get it in the\r\nsmall of the back. Take the advice of an old friend who means you well\r\nand vanish. In the inspired words of the lad we’ve just parted from,\r\n’op it!”\r\n\r\nThe stage-door man turned this over in his mind for a space.\r\n\r\n“But I’m supposed to stay ’ere till eleven-thirty and lock up!” he\r\nsaid. “That’s what I’m supposed to do. Stay ’ere till eleven-thirty and\r\nlock up! And it ain’t but ten-forty-five now.”\r\n\r\n“I see the difficulty,” said Jill’s companion thoughtfully. “It’s what\r\nyou might call an _impasse_. French! Well, Casabianca, I’m afraid I\r\ndon’t see how to help you. It’s a matter for your own conscience. I\r\ndon’t want to lure you from the burning deck: on the other hand, if you\r\nstick on here, you’ll most certainly be fried on both sides … But, tell\r\nme. You spoke about locking up something at eleven-thirty. What are you\r\nsupposed to lock up?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the theatre.”\r\n\r\n“Then that’s all right. By eleven-thirty there won’t _be_ a theatre. If\r\nI were you, I should leave quietly and unostentatiously now. Tomorrow,\r\nif you wish it, and if they’ve cooled off sufficiently, you can come\r\nand sit on the ruins. Good night!”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nOutside, the air was cold and crisp. Jill drew her warm cloak closer.\r\nRound the corner there was noise and shouting. Fire-engines had\r\narrived. Jill’s companion lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to stop and see the conflagration?” he asked.\r\n\r\nJill shivered. She was more shaken than she had realized.\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen all the conflagration I want.”\r\n\r\n“Same here. Well, it’s been an exciting evening. Started slow, I admit,\r\nbut warmed up later! What I seem to need at the moment is a restorative\r\nstroll along the Embankment. Do you know, Sir Portwood Chester didn’t\r\nlike the title of my play. He said ‘Tried by Fire’ was too\r\nmelodramatic. Well, he can’t say now it wasn’t appropriate.”\r\n\r\nThey made their way towards the river, avoiding the street which was\r\nblocked by the crowds and the fire-engines. As they crossed the Strand,\r\nthe man looked back. A red glow was in the sky.\r\n\r\n“A great blaze!” he said. “What you might call—in fact what the papers\r\n_will_ call—a holocaust. Quite a treat for the populace.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think they will be able to put it out?”\r\n\r\n“Not a chance. It’s got too much of a hold. It’s a pity you hadn’t that\r\ngarden-hose of yours with you, isn’t it!”\r\n\r\nJill stopped, wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n“Garden-hose?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you remember the garden-hose? I do! I can feel that clammy\r\nfeeling of the water trickling down my back now!”\r\n\r\nMemory, always a laggard by the wayside that redeems itself by an\r\neleventh-hour rush, raced back to Jill. The Embankment turned to a\r\nsunlit garden, and the January night to a July day. She stared at him.\r\nHe was looking at her with a whimsical smile. It was a smile which,\r\npleasant today, had seemed mocking and hostile on that afternoon years\r\nago. She had always felt then that he was laughing at her, and at the\r\nage of twelve she had resented laughter at her expense.\r\n\r\n“You surely can’t be Wally Mason!”\r\n\r\n“I was wondering when you would remember.”\r\n\r\n“But the programme called you something else,—John something.”\r\n\r\n“That was a cunning disguise. Wally Mason is the only genuine and\r\nofficial name. And, by Jove! I’ve just remembered yours. It was\r\nMariner. By the way,”—he paused for an almost imperceptible instant—“is\r\nit still?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nJill was hardly aware that he had asked her a question. She was\r\nsuffering that momentary sense of unreality which comes to us when the\r\nyears roll away and we are thrown abruptly back into the days of our\r\nchildhood. The logical side of her mind was quite aware that there was\r\nnothing remarkable in the fact that Wally Mason, who had been to her\r\nall these years a boy in an Eton suit, should now present himself as a\r\ngrown man. But for all that the transformation had something of the\r\neffect of a conjuring-trick. It was not only the alteration in his\r\nappearance that startled her: it was the amazing change in his\r\npersonality. Wally Mason had been the _bete noire_ of her childhood.\r\nShe had never failed to look back at the episode of the garden-hose\r\nwith the feeling that she had acted well, that—however she might have\r\nstrayed in those early days from the straight and narrow path—in that\r\none particular crisis she had done the right thing. And now she had\r\ntaken an instant liking for him. Easily as she made friends, she had\r\nseldom before felt so immediately drawn to a strange man. Gone was the\r\nancient hostility, and in its place a soothing sense of comradeship.\r\nThe direct effect of this was to make Jill feel suddenly old. It was as\r\nif some link that joined her to her childhood had been snapped.\r\n\r\nShe glanced down the Embankment. Close by, to the left, Waterloo Bridge\r\nloomed up, dark and massive against the steel-gray sky, A tram-car,\r\nfull of home-bound travellers, clattered past over rails that shone\r\nwith the peculiarly frostbitten gleam that seems to herald snow. Across\r\nthe river, everything was dark and mysterious, except for an occasional\r\nlamp-post and the dim illumination of the wharves. It was a depressing\r\nprospect, and the thought crossed her mind that to the derelicts whose\r\nnightly resting-place was a seat on the Embankment the view must seem\r\neven bleaker than it did to herself. She gave a little shiver. Somehow\r\nthis sudden severance from the old days had brought with it a\r\nforlornness. She seemed to be standing alone in a changed world.\r\n\r\n“Cold?” said Wally Mason.\r\n\r\n“A little.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s walk.”\r\n\r\nThey moved westwards. Cleopatra’s Needle shot up beside them, a\r\npointing finger. Down on the silent river below, coffin-like row-boats\r\nlay moored to the wall. Through a break in the trees the clock over the\r\nHouses of Parliament shone for an instant as if suspended in the sky,\r\nthen vanished as the trees closed in. A distant barge in the direction\r\nof Battersea wailed and was still. It had a mournful and foreboding\r\nsound. Jill shivered again. It annoyed her that she could not shake off\r\nthis quite uncalled-for melancholy, but it withstood every effort. Why\r\nshe should have felt that a chapter, a pleasant chapter, in the book of\r\nher life had been closed, she could not have said, but the feeling\r\nlingered.\r\n\r\n“Correct me if I am wrong,” said Wally Mason, breaking a silence that\r\nhad lasted several minutes, “but you seem to me to be freezing in your\r\ntracks. Ever since I came to London I’ve had a habit of heading for the\r\nEmbankment in times of mental stress, but perhaps the middle of winter\r\nis not quite the moment for communing with the night. The Savoy is\r\nhandy, if we stop walking away from it. I think we might celebrate this\r\nreunion with a little supper, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nJill’s depression disappeared magically. Her mercurial temperament\r\nasserted itself.\r\n\r\n“Lights!” she said. “Music!”\r\n\r\n“And food! To an ethereal person like you that remark may seem gross,\r\nbut I had no dinner.”\r\n\r\n“You poor dear! Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Just nervousness.”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course.” The interlude of the fire had caused her to forget\r\nhis private and personal connection with the night’s events. Her mind\r\nwent back to something he had said in the theatre. “Wally—” She\r\nstopped, a little embarrassed. “I suppose I ought to call you Mr Mason,\r\nbut I’ve always thought of you …”\r\n\r\n“Wally, if you please, Jill. It’s not as though we were strangers. I\r\nhaven’t my book of etiquette with me, but I fancy that about eleven\r\ngallons of cold water down the neck constitutes an introduction. What\r\nwere you going to say?”\r\n\r\n“It was what you said to Freddie about putting up money. Did you\r\nreally?”\r\n\r\n“Put up the money for that ghastly play? I did. Every cent. It was the\r\nonly way to get it put on.”\r\n\r\n“But why … ? I forget what I was going to say!”\r\n\r\n“Why did I want it put on? Well, it does seem odd, but I give you my\r\nhonest word that until tonight I thought the darned thing a\r\nmasterpiece. I’ve been writing musical comedies for the last few years,\r\nand after you’ve done that for a while your soul rises up within you\r\nand says, ‘Come, come, my lad! You can do better than this!’ That’s\r\nwhat mine said, and I believed it. Subsequent events have proved that\r\nSidney the Soul was pulling my leg!”\r\n\r\n“But—then you’ve lost a great deal of money?”\r\n\r\n“The hoarded wealth, if you don’t mind my being melodramatic for a\r\nmoment, of a lifetime. And no honest old servitor who dangled me on his\r\nknee as a baby to come along and offer me his savings! They don’t make\r\nservitors like that in America, worse luck. There is a Swedish lady who\r\nlooks after my simple needs back there, but instinct tells me that, if\r\nI were to approach her on the subject of loosening up for the benefit\r\nof the young master, she would call a cop. Still, I’ve gained\r\nexperience, which they say is just as good as cash, and I’ve enough\r\nmoney left to pay the check, at any rate, so come along.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the supper-room of the Savoy Hotel there was, as anticipated, food\r\nand light and music. It was still early, and the theatres had not yet\r\nemptied themselves, so that the big room was as yet but half full.\r\nWally Mason had found a table in the corner, and proceeded to order\r\nwith the concentration of a hungry man.\r\n\r\n“Forgive my dwelling so tensely on the bill-of-fare,” he said, when the\r\nwaiter had gone. “You don’t know what it means to one in my condition\r\nto have to choose between poulet en casserole and kidneys a la maitre\r\nd’hotel. A man’s cross-roads!”\r\n\r\nJill smiled happily across the table at him. She could hardly believe\r\nthat this old friend with whom she had gone through the perils of the\r\nnight and with whom she was now about to feast was the sinister figure\r\nthat had cast a shadow on her childhood. He looked positively incapable\r\nof pulling a little girl’s hair—as no doubt he was.\r\n\r\n“You always were greedy,” she commented. “Just before I turned the hose\r\non you, I remember you had made yourself thoroughly disliked by\r\npocketing a piece of my birthday-cake.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember that?” His eyes lit up and he smiled back at her. He\r\nhad an ingratiating smile. His mouth was rather wide, and it seemed to\r\nstretch right across his face. He reminded Jill more than ever of a\r\nbig, friendly dog. “I can feel it now,—all squashy in my pocket,\r\ninextricably mingled with a catapult, a couple of marbles, a box of\r\nmatches, and some string. I was quite the human general store in those\r\ndays. Which reminds me that we have been some time settling down to an\r\nexchange of our childhood reminiscences, haven’t we?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been trying to realise that you are Wally Mason. You have altered\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“For the better?”\r\n\r\n“Very much for the better! You were a horrid little brute. You used to\r\nterrify me. I never knew when you were going to bound out at me from\r\nbehind a tree or something. I remember your chasing me for miles,\r\nshrieking at the top of your voice!”\r\n\r\n“Sheer embarrassment! I told you just now how I used to worship you. If\r\nI shrieked a little, it was merely because I was shy. I did it to hide\r\nmy devotion.”\r\n\r\n“You certainly succeeded. I never even suspected it.”\r\n\r\nWally sighed.\r\n\r\n“How like life! I never told my love, but let concealment like a worm\r\ni’ the bud …”\r\n\r\n“Talking of worms, you once put one down my back!”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Wally in a shocked voice. “Not that! I was boisterous,\r\nperhaps, but surely always the gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“You did! In the shrubbery. There had been a thunderstorm and …”\r\n\r\n“I remember the incident now. A mere misunderstanding. I had done with\r\nthe worm, and thought you might be glad to have it.”\r\n\r\n“You were always doing things like that. Once you held me over the pond\r\nand threatened to drop me into the water—in the winter! Just before\r\nChristmas. It was a particularly mean thing to do, because I couldn’t\r\neven kick your shins for fear you would let me fall. Luckily Uncle\r\nChris came up and made you stop.”\r\n\r\n“You considered that a fortunate occurrence, did you?” said Wally.\r\n“Well, perhaps from your point of view it may have been. I saw the\r\nthing from a different angle. Your uncle had a whangee with him, and\r\nthe episode remains photographically lined on the tablets of my mind\r\nwhen a yesterday has faded from its page. My friends sometimes wonder\r\nwhat I mean when I say that my old wound troubles me in frosty weather.\r\nBy the way, how is your uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s very well. Just as lazy as ever. He’s away at present, down\r\nat Brighton.”\r\n\r\n“He didn’t strike me as lazy,” said Wally thoughtfully. “Dynamic would\r\nexpress it better. But perhaps I happened to encounter him in a moment\r\nof energy.”\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t look a day older than he did then.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I don’t recall his appearance very distinctly. On the only\r\noccasion on which we ever really foregathered—hobnobbed, so to speak—he\r\nwas behind me most of the time. Ah!” The waiter had returned with a\r\nloaded tray. “The food! Forgive me if I seem a little distrait for a\r\nmoment or two. There is man’s work before me!”\r\n\r\n“And later on, I suppose, you would like a chop or something to take\r\naway in your pocket?”\r\n\r\n“I will think it over. Possibly a little soup. My needs are very simple\r\nthese days.”\r\n\r\nJill watched him with a growing sense of satisfaction. There was\r\nsomething boyishly engaging about this man. She felt at home with him.\r\nHe affected her in much the same way as did Freddie Rooke. He was a\r\ndefinite addition to the things that went to make her happy.\r\n\r\nShe liked him particularly for being such a good loser. She had always\r\nbeen a good loser herself, and the quality was one which she admired.\r\nIt was nice of him to dismiss from his conversation—and apparently from\r\nhis thoughts—that night’s fiasco and all that it must have cost him.\r\nShe wondered how much he had lost. Certainly something very\r\nsubstantial. Yet it seemed to trouble him not at all. Jill considered\r\nhis behavior gallant, and her heart warmed to him. This was how a man\r\nought to take the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.\r\n\r\nWally sighed contentedly, and leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n“An unpleasant exhibition!” he said apologetically. “But unavoidable.\r\nAnd, anyway, I take it that you would prefer to have me well-fed and\r\nhappy about the place than swooning on the floor with starvation. A\r\nwonderful thing, food! I am now ready to converse intelligently on any\r\nsubject you care to suggest. I have eaten rose-leaves and am no more a\r\ngolden ass, so to speak! What shall we talk about?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about yourself.”\r\n\r\nWally beamed.\r\n\r\n“There is no nobler topic! But what aspect of myself do you wish me to\r\ntouch on? My thoughts, my tastes, my amusements, my career, or what? I\r\ncan talk about myself for hours. My friends in New York often complain\r\nabout it bitterly.”\r\n\r\n“New York?” said Jill. “Oh then you live in America?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I only came over here to see that darned false alarm of a play of\r\nmine put on.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you put it on in New York?”\r\n\r\n“Too many of the lads of the village know me over there. This was a new\r\ndeparture, you see. What the critics in those parts expect from me is\r\nsomething entitled ‘Wow! Wow!’ or ‘The Girl from Yonkers’. It would\r\nhave unsettled their minds to find me breaking out in poetic drama.\r\nThey are men of coarse fibre and ribald mind and they would have been\r\nvery funny about it. I thought it wiser to come over here among\r\nstrangers, little thinking that I should sit in the next seat to\r\nsomebody I had known all my life.”\r\n\r\n“But when did you go to America? And why?”\r\n\r\n“I think it must have been four—five—well, quite a number of years\r\nafter the hose episode. Probably you didn’t observe that I wasn’t still\r\naround, but we crept silently out of the neighborhood round about that\r\ntime and went to live in London.” His tone lost its lightness\r\nmomentarily. “My father died, you know, and that sort of broke things\r\nup. He didn’t leave any too much money, either. Apparently we had been\r\nliving on rather too expansive a scale during the time I knew you. At\r\nany rate, I was more or less up against it until your father got me a\r\njob in an office in New York.”\r\n\r\n“My father!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. It was wonderfully good of him to bother about me. I didn’t\r\nsuppose he would have known me by sight, and even if he had remembered\r\nme, I shouldn’t have imagined that the memory would have been a\r\npleasant one. But he couldn’t have taken more trouble if I had been a\r\nblood-relation.”\r\n\r\n“That was just like father,” said Jill softly.\r\n\r\n“He was a prince.”\r\n\r\n“But you aren’t in the office now?”\r\n\r\n“No. I found I had a knack of writing verses and things, and I wrote a\r\nfew vaudeville songs. Then I came across a man named Bevan at a\r\nmusic-publisher’s. He was just starting to write music, and we got\r\ntogether and turned out some vaudeville sketches, and then a manager\r\nsent for us to fix up a show that was dying on the road and we had the\r\ngood luck to turn it into a success, and after that it was pretty good\r\ngoing. Managers are just like sheep. They know nothing whatever about\r\nthe show business themselves, and they come flocking after anybody who\r\nlooks as if he could turn out the right stuff. They never think any one\r\nany good except the fellow who had the last hit. So, while your luck\r\nlasts, you have to keep them off with a stick. Then you have a couple\r\nof failures, and they skip off after somebody else, till you have\r\nanother success, and then they all come skipping back again, bleating\r\nplaintively. George Bevan got married the other day—you probably read\r\nabout it—he married Lord Marshmoreton’s daughter. Lucky devil!”\r\n\r\n“Are you married?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You were faithful to my memory?” said Jill with a smile.\r\n\r\n“I was.”\r\n\r\n“It can’t last,” said Jill, shaking her head. “One of these days you’ll\r\nmeet some lovely American girl and then you’ll put a worm down her back\r\nor pull her hair or whatever it is you do when you want to show your\r\ndevotion, and … What are you looking at? Is something interesting going\r\non behind me?”\r\n\r\nHe had been looking past her out into the room.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing,” he said. “Only there’s a statuesque old lady about two\r\ntables back of you who has been staring at you, with intervals for\r\nrefreshment, for the last five minutes. You seem to fascinate her.”\r\n\r\n“An old lady?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. With a glare! She looks like Dunsany’s Bird of the Difficult Eye.\r\nCount ten and turn carelessly round. There, at that table. Almost\r\nbehind you.”\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!” exclaimed Jill.\r\n\r\nShe turned quickly round again.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter? Do you know her? Somebody you don’t want to meet?”\r\n\r\n“It’s Lady Underhill! And Derek’s with her!”\r\n\r\nWally had been lifting his glass. He put it down rather suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Derek?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Derek Underhill. The man I’m engaged to marry.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Wally thoughtfully. “The man you’re engaged to marry? Yes, I\r\nsee!”\r\n\r\nHe raised his glass again, and drank its contents quickly.\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nJill looked at her companion anxiously. Recent events had caused her\r\ncompletely to forget the existence of Lady Underhill. She was always so\r\nintensely interested in what she happened to be doing at the moment\r\nthat she often suffered these temporary lapses of memory. It occurred\r\nto her now,—too late, as usual,—that the Savoy Hotel was the last place\r\nin London where she should have come to supper with Wally. It was the\r\nhotel where Lady Underhill was staying. She frowned. Life had suddenly\r\nceased to be careless and happy, and had become a problem-ridden thing,\r\nfull of perplexity and misunderstandings.\r\n\r\n“What shall I do?”\r\n\r\nWally Mason started at the sound of her voice. He appeared to be deep\r\nin thoughts of his own.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“What shall I do?”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t be worried.”\r\n\r\n“Derek will be awfully cross.”\r\n\r\nWally’s good-humored mouth tightened almost imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n“Why?” he said. “There’s nothing wrong in your having supper with an\r\nold friend.”\r\n\r\n“N-no,” said Jill doubtfully. “But …”\r\n\r\n“Derek Underhill,” said Wally reflectively. “Is that Sir Derek\r\nUnderhill, whose name one’s always seeing in the papers?”\r\n\r\n“Derek is in the papers a lot. He’s an M.P. and all sorts of things.”\r\n\r\n“Good-looking fellow. Ah, here’s the coffee.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want any, thanks.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense. Why spoil your meal because of this? Do you smoke?”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks.”\r\n\r\n“Given it up, eh? Daresay you’re wise. Stunts the growth and increases\r\nthe expenses.”\r\n\r\n“Given it up?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you remember sharing one of your father’s cigars with me behind\r\nthe haystack in the meadow? We cut it in half. I finished my half, but\r\nI fancy about three puffs were enough for you. Those were happy days!”\r\n\r\n“That one wasn’t! Of course I remember it now. I don’t suppose I shall\r\never forget it.”\r\n\r\n“The thing was my fault, as usual. I recollect I dared you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I always took a dare.”\r\n\r\n“Do you still?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nWally knocked the ash off his cigarette.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said slowly, “suppose I were to dare you to get up and walk\r\nover to that table and look your fiancé in the eye and say, ‘Stop\r\nscowling at my back hair! I’ve a perfect right to be supping with an\r\nold friend!’—would you do it?”\r\n\r\n“Is he?” said Jill, startled.\r\n\r\n“Scowling? Can’t you feel it on the back of your head?” He drew\r\nthoughtfully at his cigarette. “If I were you I should stop that sort\r\nof thing at the source. It’s a habit that can’t be discouraged in a\r\nhusband too early. Scowling is the civilized man’s substitute for\r\nwife-beating.”\r\n\r\nJill moved uncomfortably in her chair. Her quick temper resented his\r\ntone. There was a hostility, a hardly veiled contempt in his voice\r\nwhich stung her. Derek was sacred. Whoever criticized him, presumed.\r\nWally, a few minutes before a friend and an agreeable companion, seemed\r\nto her to have changed. He was once more the boy whom she had disliked\r\nin the old days. There was a gleam in her eyes which should have warned\r\nhim, but he went on.\r\n\r\n“I should imagine that this Derek of yours is not one of our leading\r\nsunbeams. Well, I suppose he could hardly be, if that’s his mother and\r\nthere is anything in heredity.”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t criticize Derek,” said Jill coldly.\r\n\r\n“I was only saying …”\r\n\r\n“Never mind. I don’t like it.”\r\n\r\nA slow flush crept over Wally’s face. He made no reply, and there fell\r\nbetween them a silence that was like a shadow. Jill sipped her coffee\r\nmiserably. She was regretting that little spurt of temper. She wished\r\nshe could have recalled the words. Not that it was the actual words\r\nthat had torn asunder this gossamer thing, the friendship which they\r\nhad begun to weave like some fragile web: it was her manner, the manner\r\nof the princess rebuking an underling. She knew that, if she had struck\r\nhim, she could not have offended Wally more deeply. There are some men\r\nwhose ebullient natures enable them to rise unscathed from the worst\r\nsnub. Wally, her intuition told her, was not that kind of man.\r\n\r\nThere was only one way of mending the matter. In these clashes of human\r\ntemperaments, these sudden storms that spring up out of a clear sky, it\r\nis possible sometimes to repair the damage, if the psychological moment\r\nis resolutely seized, by talking rapidly and with detachment on neutral\r\ntopics. Words have made the rift, and words alone can bridge it. But\r\nneither Jill nor her companion could find words, and the silence\r\nlengthened grimly. When Wally spoke, it was in the level tones of a\r\npolite stranger.\r\n\r\n“Your friends have gone.”\r\n\r\nHis voice was the voice in which, when she went on railway journeys,\r\nfellow-travellers in the carriage enquired of Jill if she would prefer\r\nthe window up or down. It had the effect of killing her regrets and\r\nfeeding her resentment. She was a girl who never refused a challenge,\r\nand she set herself to be as frigidly polite and aloof as he.\r\n\r\n“Really?” she said. “When did they leave?”\r\n\r\n“A moment ago.” The lights gave the warning flicker that announces the\r\narrival of the hour of closing. In the momentary darkness they both\r\nrose. Wally scrawled his name across the check which the waiter had\r\ninsinuated upon his attention. “I suppose we had better be moving?”\r\n\r\nThey crossed the room in silence. Everybody was moving in the same\r\ndirection. The broad stairway leading to the lobby was crowded with\r\nchattering supper-parties. The lights had gone up again.\r\n\r\nAt the cloak-room Wally stopped.\r\n\r\n“I see Underhill waiting up there,” he said casually, “To take you\r\nhome, I suppose. Shall we say good-night? I’m staying in the hotel.”\r\n\r\nJill glanced towards the head of the stairs. Derek was there. He was\r\nalone. Lady Underhill presumably had gone up to her room in the\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nWally was holding out his hand. His face was stolid, and his eyes\r\navoided hers.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Jill.\r\n\r\nShe felt curiously embarrassed. At this last moment hostility had\r\nweakened, and she was conscious of a desire to make amends. She and\r\nthis man had been through much together that night, much that was\r\nperilous and much that was pleasant. A sudden feeling of remorse came\r\nover her.\r\n\r\n“You’ll come and see us, won’t you?” she said a little wistfully. “I’m\r\nsure my uncle would like to meet you again.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very good of you,” said Wally, “but I’m afraid I shall be going\r\nback to America at any moment now.”\r\n\r\nPique, that ally of the devil, regained its slipping grip upon Jill.\r\n\r\n“Oh? I’m sorry,” she said indifferently. “Well, goodbye, then.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you have a pleasant voyage.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\nHe turned into the cloak-room, and Jill went up the stairs to join\r\nDerek. She felt angry and depressed, full of a sense of the futility of\r\nthings. People flashed into one’s life and out again. Where was the\r\nsense of it?\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nDerek had been scowling, and Derek still scowled. His eyebrows were\r\nformidable, and his mouth smiled no welcome at Jill as she approached\r\nhim. The evening, portions of which Jill had found so enjoyable, had\r\ncontained no pleasant portions for Derek. Looking back over a lifetime\r\nwhose events had been almost uniformly agreeable, he told himself that\r\nhe could not recall another day which had gone so completely awry. It\r\nhad started with the fog. He hated fog. Then had come that meeting with\r\nhis mother at Charing Cross, which had been enough to upset him by\r\nitself. After that, rising to a crescendo of unpleasantness, the day\r\nhad provided that appalling situation at the Albany, the recollection\r\nof which still made him tingle; and there had followed the silent\r\ndinner, the boredom of the early part of the play, the fire at the\r\ntheatre, the undignified scramble for the exits, and now this discovery\r\nof the girl whom he was engaged to marry supping at the Savoy with a\r\nfellow he didn’t remember ever having seen in his life. All these\r\nthings combined to induce in Derek a mood bordering on ferocity. His\r\nbirth and income, combining to make him one of the spoiled children of\r\nthe world, had fitted him ill for such a series of catastrophes.\r\n\r\nBreeding counts. Had he belonged to a lower order of society, Derek\r\nwould probably have seized Jill by the throat and started to choke her.\r\nBeing what he was, he merely received her with frozen silence and led\r\nher out to the waiting taxi-cab. It was only when the cab had started\r\non its journey that he found relief in speech.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, mastering with difficulty an inclination to raise his\r\nvoice to a shout, “perhaps you will kindly explain?”\r\n\r\nJill had sunk back against the cushions of the cab. The touch of his\r\nbody against hers always gave her a thrill, half pleasurable, half\r\nfrightening. She had never met anybody who affected her in this way as\r\nDerek did. She moved a little closer, and felt for his hand. But, as\r\nshe touched it, it retreated—coldly. Her heart sank. It was like being\r\ncut in public by somebody very dignified.\r\n\r\n“Derek, darling!” Her lips trembled. Others had seen this side of Derek\r\nUnderhill frequently, for he was a man who believed in keeping the\r\nworld in its place, but she never. To her he had always been the\r\nperfect gracious knight. A little too perfect, perhaps, a trifle too\r\ngracious, possibly, but she had been too deeply in love to notice that.\r\n“Don’t be cross!”\r\n\r\nThe English language is the richest in the world, and yet somehow in\r\nmoments when words count most we generally choose the wrong ones. The\r\nadjective “cross” as a description of his Jove-like wrath that consumed\r\nhis whole being jarred upon Derek profoundly. It was as though\r\nPrometheus, with the vultures tearing his liver, had been asked if he\r\nwere piqued.\r\n\r\n“Cross!”\r\n\r\nThe cab rolled on. Lights from lamp-posts flashed in at the windows. It\r\nwas a pale, anxious little face that they lit up when they shone upon\r\nJill.\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand you,” said Derek at last. Jill noticed that he had\r\nnot yet addressed her by her name. He was speaking straight out in\r\nfront of him as if he were soliloquizing. “I simply cannot understand\r\nyou. After what happened before dinner tonight, for you to cap\r\neverything by going off alone to supper at a restaurant, where half the\r\npeople in the room must have known you, with a man …”\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand!”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! I said I did not understand.” The feeling of having scored a\r\npoint made Derek feel a little better. “I admit it. Your behavior is\r\nincomprehensible. Where did you meet this fellow?”\r\n\r\n“I met him at the theatre. He was the author of the play.”\r\n\r\n“The man you told me you had been talking to? The fellow who scraped\r\nacquaintance with you between the acts?”\r\n\r\n“But I found out he was an old friend. I mean, I knew him when I was a\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t tell me that,”\r\n\r\n“I only found it out later.”\r\n\r\n“After he had invited you to supper! It’s maddening!” cried Derek, the\r\nsense of his wrongs surging back over him. “What do you suppose my\r\nmother thought? She asked me who the man with you was. I had to say I\r\ndidn’t know! What do you suppose she thought?”\r\n\r\nIt is to be doubted whether anything else in the world could have\r\nrestored the fighting spirit to Jill’s cowering soul at that moment:\r\nbut the reference to Lady Underhill achieved this miracle. That deep\r\nmutual antipathy which is so much more common than love at first sight\r\nhad sprung up between the two at the instant of their meeting. The\r\ncircumstances of that meeting had caused it to take root and grow. To\r\nJill Derek’s mother was by this time not so much a fellow human being\r\nwhom she disliked as a something, a sort of force, that made for her\r\nunhappiness. She was a menace and a loathing.\r\n\r\n“If your mother had asked me that question,” she retorted with spirit\r\n“I should have told her that he was the man who got me safely out of\r\nthe theatre after you …” She checked herself. She did not want to say\r\nthe unforgiveable thing. “You see,” she said, more quietly, “you had\r\ndisappeared. …”\r\n\r\n“My mother is an old woman,” said Derek stiffly. “Naturally I had to\r\nlook after her. I called to you to follow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I understand. I’m simply trying to explain what happened. I was\r\nthere all alone, and Wally Mason …”\r\n\r\n“Wally!” Derek uttered a short laugh, almost a bark. “It got to\r\nChristian names, eh?”\r\n\r\nJill set her teeth.\r\n\r\n“I told you I knew him as a child. I always called him Wally then.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon. I had forgotten.”\r\n\r\n“He got me out through the pass-door onto the stage and through the\r\nstage-door.”\r\n\r\nDerek was feeling cheated. He had the uncomfortable sensation that\r\ncomes to men who grandly contemplate mountains and … see them dwindle\r\nto mole-hills. The apparently outrageous had shown itself in\r\nexplanation nothing so out-of-the-way after all. He seized upon the\r\nsingle point in Jill’s behavior that still constituted a grievance.\r\n\r\n“There was no need for you to go to supper with the man!” Jove-like\r\nwrath had ebbed away to something deplorably like a querulous grumble.\r\n“You should have gone straight home. You must have known how anxious I\r\nwould be about you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, really, Derek, dear! You didn’t seem so very anxious! You were\r\nhaving supper yourself quite cosily.”\r\n\r\nThe human mind is curiously constituted. It is worthy of record that,\r\ndespite his mother’s obvious disapproval of his engagement, despite all\r\nthe occurrences of this dreadful day, it was not till she made this\r\nremark that Derek Underhill first admitted to himself that, intoxicate\r\nhis senses as she might, there was a possibility that Jill Mariner was\r\nnot the ideal wife for him. The idea came and went more quickly than\r\nbreath upon a mirror. It passed, but it had been. There are men who\r\nfear repartee in a wife more keenly than a sword. Derek was one of\r\nthese. Like most men of single outlook, whose dignity is their most\r\nprecious possession, he winced from an edged tongue.\r\n\r\n“My mother was greatly upset,” he replied coldly. “I thought a cup of\r\nsoup would do her good. And, as for being anxious about you, I\r\ntelephoned to your home to ask if you had come in.”\r\n\r\n“And when,” thought Jill, “they told you I hadn’t, you went off to\r\nsupper!”\r\n\r\nShe did not speak the words. If she had an edged tongue, she had also\r\nthe control of it. She had no wish to wound Derek. Whole-hearted in\r\neverything she did, she loved him with her whole heart. There might be\r\nspecks upon her idol—that its feet might be clay she could never\r\nbelieve—but they mattered nothing. She loved him.\r\n\r\n“I’m so sorry, dear,” she said. “So awfully sorry! I’ve been a bad\r\ngirl, haven’t I?”\r\n\r\nShe felt for his hand again, and this time he allowed it to remain\r\nstiffly in her grasp. It was like being grudgingly recognized by\r\nsomebody very dignified who had his doubts about you but reserved\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe cab drew up at the door of the house in Ovington Square which\r\nJill’s Uncle Christopher had settled upon as a suitable address for a\r\ngentleman of his standing. (“In a sense, my dear child I admit, it is\r\nBrompton Road, but it opens into Lennox Gardens, which makes it to all\r\nintents and purposes Sloane Street”) Jill put up her face to be kissed,\r\nlike a penitent child.\r\n\r\n“I’ll never be naughty again!”\r\n\r\nFor a flickering instant Derek hesitated. The drive, long as it was,\r\nhad been too short wholly to restore his equanimity. Then the sense of\r\nher nearness, her sweetness, the faint perfume of her hair, and her\r\neyes, shining softly in the darkness so close to his own, overcame him.\r\nHe crushed her to him.\r\n\r\nJill disappeared into the house with a happy laugh. It had been a\r\nterrible day, but it had ended well.\r\n\r\n“The Albany,” said Derek to the cabman.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back against the cushions. His senses were in a whirl. The\r\ncab rolled on. Presently his exalted mood vanished as quickly as it had\r\ncome. Jill absent always affected him differently from Jill present. He\r\nwas not a man of strong imagination, and the stimulus of her waned when\r\nshe was not with him. Long before the cab reached the Albany the frown\r\nwas back on his face.\r\n\r\n§ 4.\r\n\r\nArriving at the Albany, he found Freddie Rooke lying on his spine in a\r\ndeep arm-chair. His slippered feet were on the mantelpiece, and he was\r\nrestoring his wasted tissues with a strong whisky-and-soda. One of the\r\ncigars which Parker, the valet, had stamped with the seal of his\r\napproval was in the corner of his mouth. _The Sporting Times_, with a\r\nperusal of which he had been soothing his fluttered nerves, had fallen\r\non the floor beside the chair. He had finished reading, and was now\r\ngazing peacefully at the ceiling, his mind a perfect blank. There was\r\nnothing the matter with Freddie.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, old thing,” he observed as Derek entered. “So you buzzed out of\r\nthe fiery furnace all right? I was wondering how you had got along. How\r\nare you feeling? I’m not the man I was! These things get the old system\r\nall stirred up! I’ll do anything in reason to oblige and help things\r\nalong and all that, but to be called on at a moment’s notice to play\r\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego rolled into one, without rehearsal or\r\nmake-up, is a bit too thick! No, young feller-me-lad! If theatre-fires\r\nare going to be the fashion this season, the Last of the Rookes will\r\nsit quietly at home and play solitaire. Mix yourself a drink of\r\nsomething, old man, or something of that kind. By the way, your jolly\r\nold mater. All right? Not even singed? Fine! Make a long arm and gather\r\nin a cigar.”\r\n\r\nAnd Freddie, having exerted himself to play the host in a suitable\r\nmanner, wedged himself more firmly into his chair and blew a cloud of\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nDerek sat down. He lit a cigar, and stared silently at the fire. From\r\nthe mantelpiece Jill’s photograph smiled down, but he did not look at\r\nit. Presently his attitude began to weigh upon Freddie. Freddie had had\r\na trying evening. What he wanted just now was merry prattle, and his\r\nfriend did not seem disposed to contribute his share. He removed his\r\nfeet from the mantelpiece, and wriggled himself sideways, so that he\r\ncould see Derek’s face. Its gloom touched him. Apart from his\r\nadmiration for Derek, he was a warm-hearted young man, and sympathized\r\nwith affliction when it presented itself to his notice.\r\n\r\n“Something on your mind, old bean?” he enquired delicately.\r\n\r\nDerek did not answer for a moment. Then he reflected that, little as he\r\nesteemed the other’s mentality, he and Freddie had known each other a\r\nlong time, and that it would be a relief to confide in some one. And\r\nFreddie, moreover, was an old friend of Jill and the man who had\r\nintroduced him to her.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I’m listening, old top,” said Freddie. “Release the film.”\r\n\r\nDerek drew at his cigar, and watched the smoke as it curled to the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n“It’s about Jill.”\r\n\r\nFreddie signified his interest by wriggling still further sideways.\r\n\r\n“Jill, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Freddie, she’s so damned impulsive!”\r\n\r\nFreddie nearly rolled out of his chair. This, he took it, was what\r\nwriting-chappies called a coincidence.\r\n\r\n“Rummy you should say that,” he ejaculated. “I was telling her exactly\r\nthe same thing myself only this evening.” He hesitated. “I fancy I can\r\nsee what you’re driving at, old thing. The watchword is ‘What ho, the\r\nmater!’ yes, no? You’ve begun to get a sort of idea that if Jill\r\ndoesn’t watch her step, she’s apt to sink pretty low in the betting,\r\nwhat? I know exactly what you mean! You and I know all right that\r\nJill’s a topper. But one can see that to your mater she might seem a\r\nbit different. I mean to say, your jolly old mater only judging by\r\nfirst impressions, and the meeting not having come off quite as\r\nscheduled … I say, old man,” he broke off, “fearfully sorry and all\r\nthat about that business. You know what I mean! Wouldn’t have had it\r\nhappen for the world. I take it the mater was a trifle peeved? Not to\r\nsay perturbed and chagrined? I seemed to notice at dinner.”\r\n\r\n“She was furious, of course. She did not refer to the matter when we\r\nwere alone together, but there was no need to. I knew what she was\r\nthinking.”\r\n\r\nDerek threw away his cigar. Freddie noted this evidence of an\r\noverwrought soul—the thing was only a quarter smoked, and it was a\r\ndashed good brand, mark you—with concern.\r\n\r\n“The whole thing,” he conceded, “was a bit unfortunate.”\r\n\r\nDerek began to pace the room.\r\n\r\n“Freddie!”\r\n\r\n“On the spot, old man!”\r\n\r\n“Something’s got to be done!”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely!” Freddie nodded solemnly. He had taken this matter greatly\r\nto heart. Derek was his best friend, and he had always been extremely\r\nfond of him. It hurt him to see things going wrong. “I’ll tell you\r\nwhat, old bean. Let me handle this binge for you.”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“Me! The Final Rooke!” He jumped up, and leaned against the\r\nmantelpiece. “I’m the lad to do it. I’ve known Jill for years. She’ll\r\nlisten to me. I’ll talk to her like a Dutch uncle and make her\r\nunderstand the general scheme of things. I’ll take her out to tea\r\ntomorrow and slang her in no uncertain voice! Leave the whole thing to\r\nme, laddie!”\r\n\r\nDerek considered.\r\n\r\n“It might do some good,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Good?” said Freddie. “It’s _it_, dear boy! It’s a wheeze! You toddle\r\noff to bed and have a good sleep. I’ll fix the whole thing for you!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nThere are streets in London into which the sun seems never to\r\npenetrate. Some of these are in fashionable quarters, and it is to be\r\nsupposed that their inhabitants find an address which looks well on\r\nnote-paper a sufficient compensation for the gloom that goes with it.\r\nThe majority, however, are in the mean neighborhoods of the great\r\nrailway termini, and appear to offer no compensation whatever. They are\r\nlean, furtive streets, gray as the January sky with a sort of arrested\r\ndecay. They smell of cabbage and are much prowled over by vagrom cats.\r\nAt night they are empty and dark, and a stillness broods on them,\r\nbroken only by the cracked tingle of an occasional piano playing one of\r\nthe easier hymns, a form of music to which the dwellers in the dingy\r\nhouses are greatly addicted. By day they achieve a certain animation\r\nthrough the intermittent appearance of women in aprons, who shake rugs\r\nout of the front doors or, emerging from areas, go down to the\r\npublic-house on the corner with jugs to fetch the supper-beer. In\r\nalmost every ground-floor window there is a card announcing that\r\nfurnished lodgings may be had within. You will find these streets by\r\nthe score if you leave the main thoroughfares and take a short cut on\r\nyour way to Euston, to Paddington, or to Waterloo. But the dingiest and\r\ndeadliest and most depressing lie round about Victoria. And Daubeny\r\nStreet, Pimlico, is one of the worst of them all.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon following the events recorded, a girl was dressing in\r\nthe ground-floor room of Number Nine, Daubeny Street. A tray bearing\r\nthe remains of a late breakfast stood on the rickety table beside a\r\nbowl of wax flowers. From beneath the table peered the green cover of a\r\ncopy of _Variety_. A gray parrot in a cage by the window cracked seed\r\nand looked out into the room with a satirical eye. He had seen all this\r\nso many times before,—Nelly Bryant arraying herself in her smartest\r\nclothes to go out and besiege agents in their offices off the Strand.\r\nIt happened every day. In an hour or two she would come back as usual,\r\nsay “Oh, Gee!” in a tired sort of voice, and then Bill the parrot’s day\r\nproper would begin. He was a bird who liked the sound of his own voice,\r\nand he never got the chance of a really sustained conversation till\r\nNelly returned in the evening.\r\n\r\n“Who cares?” said Bill, and cracked another seed.\r\n\r\nIf rooms are an indication of the characters of their occupants, Nelly\r\nBryant came well out of the test of her surroundings. Nothing can make\r\na London furnished room much less horrible than it intends to be, but\r\nNelly had done her best. The furniture, what there was of it, was of\r\nthat lodging-house kind which resembles nothing else in the world. But\r\na few little touches here and there, a few instinctively tasteful\r\nalterations in the general scheme of things, had given the room almost\r\na cosy air. Later on, with the gas lit, it would achieve something\r\napproaching homeiness. Nelly, like many another nomad, had taught\r\nherself to accomplish a good deal with poor material. On the road in\r\nAmerica, she had sometimes made even a bedroom in a small hotel\r\ntolerably comfortable, than which there is no greater achievement.\r\nOddly, considering her life, she had a genius for domesticity.\r\n\r\nToday, not for the first time, Nelly was feeling unhappy. The face that\r\nlooked back at her out of the mirror at which she was arranging her\r\nmost becoming hat was weary. It was only a moderately pretty face, but\r\nloneliness and underfeeding had given it a wistful expression that had\r\ncharm. Unfortunately, it was not the sort of charm which made a great\r\nappeal to the stout, whisky-nourished men who sat behind paper-littered\r\ntables, smoking cigars, in the rooms marked “Private” in the offices of\r\ntheatrical agents. Nelly had been out of a “shop” now for many\r\nweeks,—ever since, in fact, “Follow the Girl” had finished its long ran\r\nat the Regal Theatre.\r\n\r\n“Follow the Girl,” an American musical comedy, had come over from New\r\nYork with an American company, of which Nelly had been a humble unit,\r\nand, after playing a year in London and some weeks in the number one\r\ntowns, had returned to New York. It did not cheer Nelly up in the long\r\nevenings in Daubeny Street to reflect that, if she had wished, she\r\ncould have gone home with the rest of the company. A mad impulse had\r\nseized her to try her luck in London, and here she was now, marooned.\r\n\r\n“Who cares?” said Bill.\r\n\r\nFor a bird who enjoyed talking he was a little limited in his remarks\r\nand apt to repeat himself.\r\n\r\n“I do, you poor fish!” said Nelly, completing her maneuvers with the\r\nhat and turning to the cage. “It’s all right for you—you have a swell\r\ntime with nothing to do but sit there and eat seed—but how do you\r\nsuppose I enjoy tramping around, looking for work and never finding\r\nany?”\r\n\r\nShe picked up her gloves. “Oh, well!” she said. “Wish me luck!”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, boy!” said the parrot, clinging to the bars.\r\n\r\nNelly thrust a finger into the cage and scratched his head.\r\n\r\n“Anxious to get rid of me, aren’t you? Well, so long.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, boy!”\r\n\r\n“All right, I’m going. Be good!”\r\n\r\n“Woof-woof-woof!” barked Bill the parrot, not committing himself to any\r\npromises.\r\n\r\nFor some moments after Nelly had gone he remained hunched on his perch,\r\ncontemplating the infinite. Then he sauntered along to the seed-box and\r\ntook some more light nourishment. He always liked to spread his meals\r\nout, to make them last longer. A drink of water to wash the food down,\r\nand he returned to the middle of the cage, where he proceeded to\r\nconduct a few intimate researches with his beak under his left wing.\r\nAfter which he mewed like a cat, and relapsed into silent meditation\r\nonce more. He closed his eyes and pondered on his favorite problem—Why\r\nwas he a parrot? This was always good for an hour or so, and it was\r\nthree o’clock before he had come to his customary decision that he\r\ndidn’t know. Then, exhausted by brain-work and feeling a trifle hipped\r\nby the silence of the room, he looked about him for some way of jazzing\r\nexistence up a little. It occurred to him that if he barked again it\r\nmight help.\r\n\r\n“Woof-woof-woof!”\r\n\r\nGood as far as it went, but it did not go far enough. It was not real\r\nexcitement. Something rather more dashing seemed to him to be\r\nindicated. He hammered for a moment or two on the floor of his cage,\r\nate a mouthful of the newspaper there, and stood with his head on one\r\nside, chewing thoughtfully. It didn’t taste as good as usual. He\r\nsuspected Nelly of having changed his _Daily Mail_ for the _Daily\r\nExpress_ or something. He swallowed the piece of paper, and was struck\r\nby the thought that a little climbing exercise might be what his soul\r\ndemanded. (You hang on by your beak and claws and work your way up to\r\nthe roof. It sounds tame, but it’s something to do.) He tried it. And,\r\nas he gripped the door of the cage, it swung open. Bill the parrot now\r\nperceived that this was going to be one of those days. He had not had a\r\nbit of luck like this for months.\r\n\r\nFor awhile he sat regarding the open door. Unless excited by outside\r\ninfluences, he never did anything in a hurry. Then proceeding\r\ncautiously, he passed out into the room. He had been out there before,\r\nbut always chaperoned by Nelly. This was something quite different. It\r\nwas an adventure. He hopped onto the window-sill. There was a ball of\r\nyellow wool there, but he had lunched and could eat nothing. He cast\r\naround in his mind for something to occupy him, and perceived suddenly\r\nthat the world was larger than he had supposed. Apparently there was a\r\nlot of it outside the room. How long this had been going on, he did not\r\nknow, but obviously it was a thing to be investigated. The window was\r\nopen at the bottom, and just outside the window were what he took to be\r\nthe bars of another and larger cage. As a matter of fact they were the\r\nrailings which afforded a modest protection to Number Nine. They ran\r\nthe length of the house, and were much used by small boys as a means of\r\nrattling sticks. One of these stick-rattlers passed as Bill stood there\r\nlooking down. The noise startled him for a moment, then he seemed to\r\ncome to the conclusion that this sort of thing was to be expected if\r\nyou went out into the great world and that a parrot who intended to see\r\nlife must not allow himself to be deterred by trifles. He crooned a\r\nlittle, and finally, stepping in a stately way over the window-sill,\r\nwith his toes turned in at right angles, caught at the top of the\r\nrailing with his beak, and proceeded to lower himself. Arrived at the\r\nlevel of the street, he stood looking out.\r\n\r\nA dog trotted up, spied him, and came to sniff.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, boy!” said Bill chattily.\r\n\r\nThe dog was taken aback. Hitherto, in his limited experience, birds had\r\nbeen birds and men men. Here was a blend of the two. What was to be\r\ndone about it? He barked tentatively, then, finding that nothing\r\ndisastrous ensued, pushed his nose between two of the bars and barked\r\nagain. Any one who knew Bill could have told him that he was asking for\r\nit, and he got it. Bill leaned forward and nipped his nose. The dog\r\nstarted back with a howl of agony. He was learning something new every\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n“Woof-woof-woof!” said Bill sardonically.\r\n\r\nHe perceived trousered legs, four of them, and, cocking his eye\r\nupwards, saw that two men of the lower orders stood before him. They\r\nwere gazing down at him in the stolid manner peculiar to the\r\nproletariat of London in the presence of the unusual. For some minutes\r\nthey stood drinking him in, then one of them gave judgment.\r\n\r\n“It’s a parrot!” He removed a pipe from his mouth and pointed with the\r\nstem. “A perishin’ parrot, that is, Erb.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Erb, a man of few words.\r\n\r\n“A parrot,” proceeded the other. He was seeing clearer into the matter\r\nevery moment. “That’s a parrot, that is, Erb. My brother Joe’s wife’s\r\nsister ’ad one of ’em. Come from abroad, _they_ do. My brother Joe’s\r\nwife’s sister ’ad one of ’em. Red-’aired gel she was. Married a feller\r\ndown at the Docks. _She_ ’ad one of ’em. Parrots they’re called.”\r\n\r\nHe bent down for a closer inspection, and inserted a finger through the\r\nrailings. Erb abandoned his customary taciturnity and spoke words of\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\n“Tike care ’e don’t sting yer, ’Enry!”\r\n\r\nHenry seemed wounded.\r\n\r\n“Woddyer mean sting me? I know all abart parrots, I do. My brother\r\nJoe’s wife’s sister ’ad one of ’em. They don’t ’urt yer, not if you’re\r\nkind to ’em. You know yer pals when you see ’em, don’t yer, mate?” he\r\nwent on, addressing Bill, who was contemplating the finger with one\r\nhalf-closed eye.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, boy,” said the parrot, evading the point.\r\n\r\n“Jear that?” cried Henry delightedly. “Goo’-bye, boy!’ ’Uman they are!”\r\n\r\n“’E’ll ’ave a piece out of yer finger,” warned Erb, the suspicious.\r\n\r\n“Wot, ’im!” Henry’s voice was indignant. He seemed to think that his\r\nreputation as an expert on parrots had been challenged. “’E wouldn’t\r\n’ave no piece out of my finger.”\r\n\r\n“Bet yer a narf-pint ’e would ’ave a piece out of yer finger,”\r\npersisted the skeptic.\r\n\r\n“No blinkin’ parrot’s goin’ to ’ave no piece of no finger of mine! My\r\nbrother Joe’s wife’s sister’s parrot never ’ad no piece out of no\r\nfinger of mine!” He extended the finger further and waggled it\r\nenticingly beneath Bill’s beak. “Cheerio, matey!” he said winningly.\r\n“Polly want a nut?”\r\n\r\nWhether it was mere indolence or whether the advertised docility of\r\nthat other parrot belonging to Henry’s brother’s wife’s sister had\r\ncaused him to realize that there was a certain standard of good conduct\r\nfor his species one cannot say: but for awhile Bill merely contemplated\r\ntemptation with a detached eye.\r\n\r\n“See!” said Henry.\r\n\r\n“Woof-woof-woof!” said Bill.\r\n\r\n“_Wow-Wow-Wow!_” yapped the dog, suddenly returning to the scene and\r\ngoing on with the argument at the point where he had left off.\r\n\r\nThe effect on Bill was catastrophic. Ever a high-strung bird, he lost\r\ncompletely the repose which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere and the\r\nbetter order of parrot. His nerves were shocked, and, as always under\r\nsuch conditions, his impulse was to bite blindly. He bit, and Henry—one\r\nfeels sorry for Henry: he was a well-meaning man—leaped back with a\r\nloud howl.\r\n\r\n“That’ll be ’arf a pint,” said Erb, always the business man.\r\n\r\nThere was a lull in the rapid action. The dog, mumbling softly to\r\nhimself, had moved away again and was watching affairs from the edge of\r\nthe sidewalk. Erb, having won his point, was silent once more. Henry\r\nsucked his finger. Bill, having met the world squarely and shown it\r\nwhat was what, stood where he was, whistling nonchalantly.\r\n\r\nHenry removed his finger from his mouth. “Lend me the loan of that\r\nstick of yours, Erb,” he said tensely.\r\n\r\nErb silently yielded up the stout stick which was his inseparable\r\ncompanion. Henry, a vastly different man from the genial saunterer of a\r\nmoment ago, poked wildly through the railings. Bill, panic-stricken now\r\nand wishing for nothing better than to be back in his cosy cage,\r\nshrieked loudly for help. And Freddie Rooke, running the corner with\r\nJill, stopped dead and turned pale.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” said Freddie.\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his overnight promise to Derek, Freddie Rooke had got\r\nin touch with Jill through the medium of the telephone immediately\r\nafter breakfast, and had arranged to call at Ovington Square in the\r\nafternoon. Arrived there, he found Jill with a telegram in her hand.\r\nHer Uncle Christopher, who had been enjoying a breath of sea-air down\r\nat Brighton, was returning by an afternoon train, and Jill had\r\nsuggested that Freddie should accompany her to Victoria, pick up Uncle\r\nChris, and escort him home. Freddie, whose idea had been a\r\n_tête-à-tête_ involving a brotherly lecture on impetuosity, had\r\ndemurred but had given way in the end; and they had set out to walk to\r\nVictoria together. Their way had lain through Daubeny Street, and they\r\nturned the corner just as the brutal onslaught on the innocent Henry\r\nhad occurred. Bill’s shrieks, which were of an appalling timbre,\r\nbrought them to a halt.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” cried Jill.\r\n\r\n“It sounds like a murder!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, you know this is the sort of street chappies are\r\nmurdering people in all the time.”\r\n\r\nThey caught sight of the group in front of them, and were reassured.\r\nNobody could possibly be looking so aloof and distrait as Erb, if there\r\nwere a murder going on.\r\n\r\n“It’s a bird!”\r\n\r\n“It’s a jolly old parrot. See it? Just inside the railings.”\r\n\r\nA red-hot wave of rage swept over Jill. Whatever her defects,—and\r\nalready this story has shown her far from perfect,—she had the\r\nexcellent quality of loving animals and blazing into fury when she saw\r\nthem ill-treated. At least three draymen were going about London with\r\nburning ears as the result of what she had said to them on discovering\r\nthem abusing their patient horses. Zoologically, Bill the parrot was\r\nnot an animal, but he counted as one with Jill, and she sped down\r\nDaubeny Street to his rescue,—Freddie, spatted and hatted and trousered\r\nas became the man of fashion, following disconsolately, ruefully aware\r\nthat he did not look his best sprinting like that. But Jill was cutting\r\nout a warm pace, and he held his hat on with one neatly-gloved hand and\r\ndid what he could to keep up.\r\n\r\nJill reached the scene of battle, and, stopping, eyed Henry with a\r\nbaleful glare. We, who have seen Henry in his calmer moments and know\r\nhim for the good fellow he was, are aware that he was more sinned\r\nagainst than sinning. If there is any spirit of justice in us, we are\r\npro-Henry. In his encounter with Bill the parrot, Henry undoubtedly had\r\nright on his side. His friendly overtures, made in the best spirit of\r\nkindliness, had been repulsed. He had been severely bitten. And he had\r\nlost half a pint of beer to Erb. As impartial judges we have no other\r\ncourse before us than to wish Henry luck and bid him go to it. But\r\nJill, who had not seen the opening stages of the affair, thought far\r\notherwise. She merely saw in Henry a great brute of a man poking at a\r\ndefenceless bird with a stick.\r\n\r\nShe turned to Freddie, who had come up at a gallop and was wondering\r\nwhy the deuce this sort of thing happened to him out of a city of six\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n“Make him stop, Freddie!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say you know, what!”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you see he’s hurting the poor thing? Make him leave off! Brute!”\r\nshe added to Henry (for whom one’s heart bleeds), as he jabbed once\r\nagain at his adversary.\r\n\r\nFreddie stepped reluctantly up to Henry, and tapped him on the\r\nshoulder. Freddie was one of those men who have a rooted idea that a\r\nconversation of this sort can only be begun by a tap on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Look here, you know, you can’t do this sort of thing, you know!” said\r\nFreddie.\r\n\r\nHenry raised a scarlet face.\r\n\r\n“’Oo are _you?_” he demanded.\r\n\r\nThis attack from the rear, coming on top of his other troubles, tried\r\nhis restraint sorely.\r\n\r\n“Well—” Freddie hesitated. It seemed silly to offer the fellow one of\r\nhis cards. “Well, as a matter of fact, my name’s Rooke …”\r\n\r\n“And who,” pursued Henry, “arsked _you_ to come shoving your ugly mug\r\nin ’ere?”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you put it that way …”\r\n\r\n“’E comes messing abart,” said Henry complainingly, addressing the\r\nuniverse, “and interfering in what don’t concern ’im and mucking around\r\nand interfering and messing abart. … Why,” he broke off in a sudden\r\nburst of eloquence, “I could eat two of you for a relish wiv me tea,\r\neven if you ’_ave_ got white spats!”\r\n\r\nHere Erb, who had contributed nothing to the conversation, remarked\r\n“Ah!” and expectorated on the sidewalk. The point, one gathers, seemed\r\nto Erb well taken. A neat thrust, was Erb’s verdict.\r\n\r\n“Just because you’ve got white spats,” proceeded Henry, on whose\r\nsensitive mind these adjuncts of the costume of the well-dressed man\r\nabout town seemed to have made a deep and unfavorable impression, “you\r\nthink you can come mucking around and messing abart and interfering and\r\nmucking around. This bird’s bit me in the finger, and ’ere’s the\r\nfinger, if you don’t believe me—and I’m going to twist ’is ruddy neck,\r\nif all the perishers with white spats in London come messing abart and\r\nmucking around, so you take them white spats of yours ’ome and give ’em\r\nto the old woman to cook for your Sunday dinner!”\r\n\r\nAnd Henry, having cleansed his stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff\r\nwhich weighs upon the heart, shoved the stick energetically once more\r\nthrough the railings.\r\n\r\nJill darted forward. Always a girl who believed that, if you want a\r\nthing well done, you must do it yourself, she had applied to Freddie\r\nfor assistance merely as a matter of form. All the time she had felt\r\nthat Freddie was a broken reed, and such he had proved himself.\r\nFreddie’s policy in this affair was obviously to rely on the magic of\r\nspeech, and any magic his speech might have had was manifestly offset\r\nby the fact that he was wearing white spats and that Henry, apparently,\r\nbelonged to some sort of league or society which had for its main\r\nobject the discouragement of white spats. It was plainly no good\r\nleaving the conduct of the campaign to Freddie. Whatever was to be done\r\nmust be done by herself. She seized the stick and wrenched it out of\r\nHenry’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Woof-woof-woof!” said Bill the parrot.\r\n\r\nNo dispassionate auditor could have failed to detect the nasty ring of\r\nsarcasm. It stung Henry. He was not normally a man who believed in\r\nviolence to the gentler sex outside a clump on the head of his missus\r\nwhen the occasion seemed to demand it: but now he threw away the\r\nguiding principles of a lifetime and turned on Jill like a tiger.\r\n\r\n“Gimme that stick!”\r\n\r\n“Get back!”\r\n\r\n“Here, I say, you know!” said Freddie.\r\n\r\nHenry, now thoroughly overwrought, made a rush at Jill: and Jill, who\r\nhad a straight eye, hit him accurately on the side of the head.\r\n\r\n“Goo!” said Henry, and sat down.\r\n\r\nAnd then, from behind Jill, a voice spoke.\r\n\r\n“What’s all this?”\r\n\r\nA stout policeman had manifested himself from empty space.\r\n\r\n“This won’t do!” said the policeman.\r\n\r\nErb, who had been a silent spectator of the fray, burst into speech.\r\n“She ’it ’im!”\r\n\r\nThe policeman looked at Jill. He was an officer of many years’\r\nexperience in the Force, and time had dulled in him that respect for\r\ngood clothes which he had brought with him from\r\nLittle-Sudbury-in-the-Wold in the days of his novitiate. Jill was\r\nwell-dressed, but, in the stirring epoch of the Suffrage disturbances,\r\nthe policeman had been kicked on the shins and even bitten by ladies of\r\nan equally elegant exterior. Hearts, the policeman knew, just as pure\r\nand fair may beat in Belgrave Square as in the lowlier air of Seven\r\nDials, but you have to pinch them just the same when they disturb the\r\npeace. His gaze, as it fell upon Jill, red-handed as it were with the\r\nstick still in her grasp, was stern.\r\n\r\n“Your name, please, and address, miss?” he said.\r\n\r\nA girl in blue with a big hat had come up, and was standing staring\r\nopen-mouthed at the group. At the sight of her Bill the parrot uttered\r\na shriek of welcome. Nelly Bryant had returned, and everything would\r\nnow be all right again.\r\n\r\n“Mariner,” said Jill, pale and bright-eyed. “I live at Number\r\nTwenty-two, Ovington Square.”\r\n\r\n“And yours, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Mine? Oh, ah, yes. I see what you mean. Rooke, you know. F. L. Rooke.\r\nI live at the Albany and all that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nThe policeman made an entry in his note-book. “Officer,” cried Jill,\r\n“this man was trying to kill that parrot and I stopped him. …”\r\n\r\n“Can’t help that, miss. You ’adn’t no right to hit a man with a stick.\r\nYou’ll ’ave to come along.”\r\n\r\n“But, I say, you know!” Freddie was appalled. This sort of thing had\r\nhappened to him before, but only on Boat-Race Night at the Empire,\r\nwhere it was expected of a chappie. “I mean to say!”\r\n\r\n“And you too, sir. You’re both in it.”\r\n\r\n“But …”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come along, Freddie,” said Jill quietly. “It’s perfectly absurd,\r\nbut it’s no use making a fuss.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said the policeman cordially, “is the right spirit!”.\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nLady Underhill paused for breath. She had been talking long and\r\nvehemently. She and Derek were sitting in Freddie Rooke’s apartment at\r\nthe Albany, and the subject of her monologue was Jill. Derek had been\r\nexpecting the attack, and had wondered why it had not come before. All\r\nthrough supper on the previous night, even after the discovery that\r\nJill was supping at a near-by table with a man who was a stranger to\r\nher son, Lady Underhill had preserved a grim reticence with regard to\r\nher future daughter-in-law. But today she had spoken her mind with all\r\nthe energy which comes of suppression. She had relieved herself with a\r\nflow of words of all the pent-up hostility that had been growing within\r\nher since that first meeting in this same room. She had talked rapidly,\r\nfor she was talking against time. The Town Council of the principal\r\ncity in Derek’s constituency in the north of England had decided that\r\ntomorrow morning should witness the laying of the foundation stone of\r\ntheir new Town Hall, and Derek as the sitting member was to preside at\r\nthe celebration. Already Parker had been dispatched to telephone for a\r\ncab to take him to the station, and at any moment their conversation\r\nmight be interrupted. So Lady Underhill made the most of what little\r\ntime she had.\r\n\r\nDerek had listened gloomily, scarcely rousing himself to reply. His\r\nmother would have been gratified, could she have known how powerfully\r\nher arguments were working on him. That little imp of doubt which had\r\nvexed him in the cab as he drove home from Ovington Square had not died\r\nin the night. It had grown and waxed more formidable. And, now, aided\r\nby this ally from without, it had become a colossus, straddling his\r\nsoul. Derek looked frequently at the clock, and cursed the unknown\r\ncabman whose delay was prolonging the scene. Something told him that\r\nonly flight could serve him now. He never had been able to withstand\r\nhis mother in one of her militant moods. She seemed to numb his\r\nfaculties. Other members of his family had also noted this quality in\r\nLady Underhill, and had commented on it bitterly in the smoking-rooms\r\nof distant country-houses at the hour when men meet to drink the final\r\nwhisky-and-soda and unburden their souls.\r\n\r\nLady Underhill, having said all she had to say, recovered her breath\r\nand began to say it again. Frequent iteration was one of her strongest\r\nweapons. As her brother Edwin, who was fond of homely imagery, had\r\noften observed, she could talk the hind-leg off a donkey.\r\n\r\n“You must be mad, Derek, to dream of handicapping yourself at this\r\nvital stage of your career with a wife who not only will not be a help\r\nto you, but must actually be a ruinous handicap. I am not blaming you\r\nfor imagining yourself in love in the first place, though I really\r\nshould have thought that a man of your strength and character would …\r\nHowever, as I say, I am not blaming you for that. Superficially, no\r\ndoubt, this girl might be called attractive. I do not admire the type\r\nmyself, but I suppose she has that quality—in my time we should have\r\ncalled it boldness—which seems to appeal to the young men of today. I\r\ncould imagine her fascinating a weak-minded imbecile like your friend\r\nMr Rooke. But that you … Still, there is no need to go into that. What\r\nI am trying to point out is that in your position, with a career like\r\nyours in front of you,—it’s quite certain that in a year or two you\r\nwill be offered some really big and responsible position—you would be\r\ninsane to tie yourself to a girl who seems to have been allowed to run\r\nperfectly wild, whose uncle is a swindler …”\r\n\r\n“She can’t be blamed for her uncle.”\r\n\r\n“… Who sups alone with strange men in public restaurants. …”\r\n\r\n“I explained that.”\r\n\r\n“You may have explained it. You certainly did not excuse it or make it\r\na whit less outrageous. You cannot pretend that you really imagine that\r\nan engaged girl is behaving with perfect correctness when she allows a\r\nman she has only just met to take her to supper at the Savoy, even if\r\nshe did know him slightly years and years ago. It is very idyllic to\r\nsuppose that a childhood acquaintance excuses every breach of decorum,\r\nbut I was brought up to believe otherwise. I don’t wish to be vulgar,\r\nbut what it amounts to is that this girl was having supper—supper! In\r\nmy days girls were in bed at supper-time!—with a strange man who picked\r\nher up at a theatre!”\r\n\r\nDerek shifted uneasily. There was a part of his mind which called upon\r\nhim to rise up and challenge the outrageous phrase and demand that it\r\nbe taken back. But he remained silent. The imp-colossus was too strong\r\nfor him. She is quite right, said the imp. That is an unpleasant but\r\naccurate description of what happened. He looked at the clock again,\r\nand wished for the hundredth time that the cab would come. Jill’s\r\nphotograph smiled at him from beside the clock. He looked away, for,\r\nwhen he found his eyes upon it, he had an odd sensation of baseness, as\r\nif he were playing some one false who loved and trusted him.\r\n\r\n“If you were an ordinary man like hundreds of the idle young men one\r\nmeets in London, I would have nothing to say. I dislike the girl\r\nintensely, but I would not interfere in what would be your own private\r\nbusiness. No doubt there are plenty of sets in society where it matters\r\nvery little what sort of a woman a man marries. But if you have a\r\ncareer, especially in politics, you know as well as I do that a\r\nsuitable wife means everything. You are a public figure even now. In a\r\nfew years you will be a very big public figure. That means that your\r\nwife will have every eye upon her. And what will she be? A minx!” said\r\nLady Underhill viciously.\r\n\r\nOnce more Derek stirred uneasily, and once more he remained silent. A\r\ngleam came into Lady Underhill’s black eyes. All her life she had been\r\na fighter, and experience had taught her to perceive when she was\r\nwinning. She blessed the dilatory cabman.\r\n\r\n“Well, I am not going to say any more,” she said, getting up and\r\nbuttoning her glove. “I will leave you to think it over. All I will say\r\nis that, though I only met her yesterday, I can assure you that I am\r\nquite confident that this girl is just the sort of harum-scarum,\r\nso-called ‘modern’ girl who is sure some day to involve herself in a\r\nreally serious scandal. I don’t want her to be in a position to drag\r\nyou into it as well. Yes, Parker, what is it? Is Sir Derek’s cab here?”\r\n\r\nThe lantern-jawed Parker had entered softly, and was standing\r\ndeferentially in the doorway. There was no emotion on his face beyond\r\nthe vague sadness which a sense of what was correct made him always\r\nwear like a sort of mask when in the presence of those of superior\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n“The cab will be at the door very shortly, m’lady. If you please, Sir\r\nDerek, a policeman has come with a message.”\r\n\r\n“A policeman?”\r\n\r\n“With a message from Mr Rooke.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I have had a few words of conversation with the constable, sir,” said\r\nParker sadly, “and I understand from him that Mr Rooke and Miss Mariner\r\nhave been arrested.”\r\n\r\n“Arrested! What are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“Mr Rooke desired the officer to ask you to be good enough to step\r\nround and bail them out!”\r\n\r\nThe gleam in Lady Underhill’s eye became a flame, but she controlled\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n“Why were Miss Mariner and Mr Rooke arrested, Parker?”\r\n\r\n“As far as I can gather, m’lady, Miss Mariner struck a man in the\r\nstreet with a stick, and they took both her and Rooke to the Chelsea\r\nPolice Station.”\r\n\r\nLady Underhill glanced at Derek, who was looking into the fire.\r\n\r\n“This is a little awkward, Derek,” she said suavely. “If you go to the\r\npolice-station, you will miss your train.”\r\n\r\n“I fancy, m’lady, it would be sufficient if Sir Derek were to dispatch\r\nme with a check for ten pounds.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Tell the policeman to wait a moment.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, m’lady.”\r\n\r\nDerek roused himself with an effort. His face was drawn and gloomy. He\r\nsat down at the writing-table, and took out his check-book. There was\r\nsilence for a moment, broken only by the scratching of the pen. Parker\r\ntook the check and left the room.\r\n\r\n“Now, perhaps,” said Lady Underhill, “you will admit that I was right!”\r\nShe spoke in almost an awed voice, for this occurrence at just this\r\nmoment seemed to her very like a direct answer to prayer. “You can’t\r\nhesitate now! You must free yourself from this detestable\r\nentanglement!”\r\n\r\nDerek rose without speaking. He took his coat and hat from where they\r\nlay on a chair.\r\n\r\n“Derek! You will! Say you will!”\r\n\r\nDerek put on his coat.\r\n\r\n“Derek!”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake, leave me alone, mother. I want to think.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. I will leave you to think it over, then.” Lady Underhill\r\nmoved to the door. At the door she paused for a moment, and seemed\r\nabout to speak again, but her mouth closed resolutely. She was a shrewd\r\nwoman, and knew that the art of life is to know when to stop talking.\r\nWhat words have accomplished, too many words can undo.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, mother.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll see you when you get back?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. No. I don’t know. I’m not certain when I shall return. I may go\r\naway for a bit.”\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind Lady Underhill. Derek sat down again at the\r\nwriting-table. He wrote a few words on a sheet of paper, then tore it\r\nup. His eye travelled to the mantelpiece. Jill’s photograph smiled\r\nhappily down at him. He turned back to the writing-table, took out a\r\nfresh piece of paper, thought for a few moments, and began to write\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe door opened softly.\r\n\r\n“The cab is at the door, Sir Derek,” said Parker.\r\n\r\nDerek addressed an envelope, and got up.\r\n\r\n“All right. Thanks. Oh, Parker, stop at a district-messenger office on\r\nyour way to the police-station, and have this sent off at once.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, Sir Derek,” said Parker.\r\n\r\nDerek’s eyes turned once more to the mantelpiece. He stood looking for\r\nan instant, then walked quickly out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nA taxi-cab stopped at the door of number twenty-two Ovington Square.\r\nFreddie Rooke emerged, followed by Jill. While Freddie paid the driver,\r\nJill sniffed the afternoon air happily. It had turned into a delightful\r\nday. A westerly breeze, springing up in the morning, had sent the\r\nthermometer up with a run and broken the cold spell which had been\r\ngripping London. It was one of those afternoons which intrude on the\r\nbleakness of winter with a false but none the less agreeable intimation\r\nthat Spring is on its way. The sidewalks were wet underfoot, and the\r\ngutters ran with thawed snow. The sun shone exhilaratingly from a sky\r\nthe color of a hedge-sparrow’s egg.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t everything smell lovely, Freddie,” said Jill, “after our\r\nprison-life!”\r\n\r\n“Topping!”\r\n\r\n“Fancy getting out so quickly! Whenever I’m arrested, I must always\r\nmake a point of having a rich man with me. I shall never tease you\r\nabout that fifty-pound note again.”\r\n\r\n“Fifty-pound note?”\r\n\r\n“It certainly came in handy today!”\r\n\r\nShe was opening the door with her latch-key, and missed the sudden\r\nsagging of Freddie’s jaw, the sudden clutch at his breast-pocket, and\r\nthe look of horror and anguish that started into his eyes. Freddie was\r\nappalled. Finding himself at the police-station penniless with the\r\nexception of a little loose change, he had sent that message to Derek,\r\nimploring assistance, as the only alternative to spending the night in\r\na cell, with Jill in another. He had realized that there was a risk of\r\nDerek taking the matter hardly, and he had not wanted to get Jill into\r\ntrouble, but there seemed nothing else to do. If they remained where\r\nthey were overnight, the thing would get into the papers, and that\r\nwould be a thousand times worse. And if he applied for aid to Ronny\r\nDevereux or Algy Martyn or anybody like that all London would know\r\nabout it next day. So Freddie, with misgivings, had sent the message to\r\nDerek, and now Jill’s words had reminded him that there was no need to\r\nhave done so. Years ago he had read somewhere or heard somewhere about\r\nsome chappie who always buzzed around with a sizeable banknote stitched\r\ninto his clothes, and the scheme had seemed to him ripe to a degree.\r\nYou never knew when you might find yourself short of cash and faced by\r\nan immediate call for the ready. He had followed the chappie’s example.\r\nAnd now, when the crisis had arrived, he had forgotten—absolutely\r\nforgotten!—that he had the dashed thing on his person at all.\r\n\r\nHe followed Jill into the house, groaning in spirit, but thankful that\r\nshe had taken it for granted that he had secured their release in the\r\nmanner indicated. He did not propose to disillusion her. It would be\r\ntime enough to take the blame when the blame came along. Probably old\r\nDerek would simply be amused and laugh at the whole bally affair like a\r\nsportsman. Freddie cheered up considerably at the thought.\r\n\r\nJill was talking to the parlormaid whose head had popped up over the\r\nbanisters flanking the stairs that led to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Major Selby hasn’t arrived yet, miss.”\r\n\r\n“That’s odd. I suppose he must have taken a later train.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a lady in the drawing-room, miss, waiting to see him. She\r\ndidn’t give any name. She said she would wait till the major came.\r\nShe’s been waiting a goodish while.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Jane. Thanks. Will you bring up tea.”\r\n\r\nThey walked down the hall. The drawing-room was on the ground floor, a\r\nlong, dim room that would have looked like a converted studio but for\r\nthe absence of bright light. A girl was sitting at the far end by the\r\nfireplace. She rose: as they entered.\r\n\r\n“How do you do?” said Jill. “I’m afraid my uncle has not come back yet\r\n…”\r\n\r\n“Say!” cried the visitor. “You _did_ get out quick!”\r\n\r\nJill was surprised. She had no recollection of ever having seen the\r\nother before. Her visitor was a rather pretty girl, with a sort of\r\njaunty way of carrying herself which made a piquant contrast to her\r\ntired eyes and wistful face. Jill took an immediate liking to her. She\r\nlooked so forlorn and pathetic.\r\n\r\n“My name’s Nelly Bryant,” said the girl. “That parrot belongs to me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see.”\r\n\r\n“I heard you say to the cop that you lived here, so I came along to\r\ntell your folks what had happened, so that they could do something. The\r\nmaid said that your uncle was expected any minute, so I waited.”\r\n\r\n“That was awfully good of you.”\r\n\r\n“Dashed good,” said Freddie.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! Honest, I don’t know how to thank you for what you did. You\r\ndon’t know what a pal Bill is to me. It would have broken me all up if\r\nthat plug-ugly had killed him.”\r\n\r\n“But what a shame you had to wait so long.”\r\n\r\n“I liked it.”\r\n\r\nNelly Bryant looked about the room wistfully. This was the sort of room\r\nshe sometimes dreamed about. She loved its subdued light and the pulpy\r\ncushions on the sofa.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have some tea before you go, won’t you?” said Jill, switching\r\non the lights.\r\n\r\n“It’s very kind of you.”\r\n\r\n“Why, hullo!” said Freddie. “By Jove! I say! We’ve met before, what?”\r\n\r\n“Why, so we have!”\r\n\r\n“That lunch at Oddy’s that young Threepwood gave, what?”\r\n\r\n“I wonder you remember.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I remember. Quite a time ago, eh? Miss Bryant was in that show,\r\n‘Follow the Girl,’ Jill, at the Regal.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. I remember you took me to see it.”\r\n\r\n“Dashed odd meeting again like this!” said Freddie. “Really rummy!”\r\n\r\nJane, the parlormaid, entering with tea, interrupted his comments.\r\n\r\n“You’re American, then?” said Jill, interested. “The whole company came\r\nfrom New York, didn’t they?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I’m half American myself, you know. I used to live in New York when I\r\nwas very small, but I’ve almost forgotten what it was like. I remember\r\na sort of over-head railway that made an awful noise …”\r\n\r\n“The Elevated!” murmured Nelly devoutly. A wave of homesickness seemed\r\nto choke her for a moment.\r\n\r\n“And the air. Like champagne. And a very blue sky.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Nelly in a small voice.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t half mind popping over New York for a bit,” said Freddie,\r\nunconscious of the agony he was inflicting. “I’ve met some very sound\r\nsportsmen who came from there. You don’t know a fellow named\r\nWilliamson, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe I do.”\r\n\r\n“Or Oakes?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“That’s rummy! Oakes has lived in New York for years.”\r\n\r\n“So have about seven million other people,” interposed Jill. “Don’t be\r\nsilly, Freddie. How would you like somebody to ask of you if you knew a\r\nman named Jenkins in London?”\r\n\r\n“I _do_ know a man named Jenkins in London,” replied Freddie\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\nJill poured out a cup of tea for her visitor, and looked at the clock.\r\n\r\n“I wonder where Uncle Chris has got to,” she said. “He ought to be here\r\nby now. I hope he hasn’t got into any mischief among the wild\r\nstock-brokers down at Brighton.”\r\n\r\nFreddie laid down his cup on the table and uttered a loud snort.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Freddie, darling!” said Jill remorsefully. “I forgot!\r\nStock-brokers are a painful subject, aren’t they!” She turned to Nelly.\r\n“There’s been an awful slump on the Stock Exchange today, and he\r\ngot—what was the word, Freddie?”\r\n\r\n“Nipped!” said Freddie with gloom.\r\n\r\n“Nipped!”\r\n\r\n“Nipped like the dickens!”\r\n\r\n“Nipped like the dickens!” Jill smiled at Nelly. “He had forgotten all\r\nabout it in the excitement of being a jailbird, and I went and reminded\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nFreddie sought sympathy from Nelly.\r\n\r\n“A silly ass at the club named Jimmy Monroe told me to take a flutter\r\nin some rotten thing called Amalgamated Dyes. You know how it is, when\r\nyou’re feeling devilish fit and cheery and all that after dinner, and\r\nsomebody sidles up to you and slips his little hand in yours and tells\r\nyou to do some fool thing. You’re so dashed nappy you simply say\r\n‘Right-ho, old bird! Make it so!’ That’s the way I got had!”\r\n\r\nJill laughed unfeelingly.\r\n\r\n“It will do you good, Freddie. It’ll stir you up and prevent you being\r\nso silly again. Besides, you know you’ll hardly notice it. You’ve much\r\ntoo much money as it is.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not the money. It’s the principle of the thing. I hate looking a\r\nfrightful chump.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you needn’t tell anybody. We’ll keep it a secret. In fact, we’ll\r\nstart at once, for I hear Uncle Chris outside. Let us dissemble. We are\r\nobserved!… Hullo, Uncle Chris!”\r\n\r\nShe ran down the room, as the door opened, and kissed the tall,\r\nsoldierly man who entered.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jill, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“How late you are. I was expecting you hours ago.”\r\n\r\n“I had to call on my broker.”\r\n\r\n“Hush! Hush!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing. … We’ve got visitors. You know Freddie Rooke, of\r\ncourse?”\r\n\r\n“How are you, Freddie, my boy?”\r\n\r\n“Cheerio!” said Freddie. “Pretty fit?”\r\n\r\n“And Miss Bryant,” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“How do you do?” said Uncle Chris in the bluff, genial way which, in\r\nhis younger days, had charmed many a five-pound note out of the pockets\r\nof his fellow-men and many a soft glance out of the eyes of their\r\nsisters, their cousins, and their aunts.\r\n\r\n“Come and have some tea,” said Jill. “You’re just in time.”\r\n\r\nNelly had subsided shyly into the depths of her big armchair. Somehow\r\nshe felt a better and a more important girl since Uncle Chris had\r\naddressed her. Most people felt like that after encountering Jill’s\r\nUncle Christopher. Uncle Chris had a manner. It was not precisely\r\ncondescending, and yet it was not the manner of an equal. He treated\r\nyou as an equal, true, but all the time you were conscious of the fact\r\nthat it was extraordinarily good of him to do so. Uncle Chris affected\r\nthe rank and file of his fellow-men much as a genial knight of the\r\nMiddle Ages would have affected a scurvy knave or varlet if he had cast\r\naside social distinctions for awhile and hobnobbed with the latter in a\r\ntavern. He never patronized, but the mere fact that he abstained from\r\npatronizing seemed somehow impressive.\r\n\r\nTo this impressiveness his appearance contributed largely. He was a\r\nfine, upstanding man, who looked less than his forty-nine years in\r\nspite of an ominous thinning of the hair which he tended and brushed so\r\ncarefully. He had a firm chin, a mouth that smiled often and pleasantly\r\nbeneath the closely-clipped moustache, and very bright blue eyes which\r\nmet yours in a clear, frank, honest gaze. Though he had served in his\r\nyouth in India, he had none of the Anglo-Indian’s sun-scorched\r\nsallowness. His complexion was fresh and sanguine. He looked as if he\r\nhad just stepped out of a cold tub,—a misleading impression, for Uncle\r\nChris detested cold water and always took his morning bath as hot as he\r\ncould get it.\r\n\r\nIt was his clothes, however, which, even more than his appearance,\r\nfascinated the populace. There is only one tailor in London, as\r\ndistinguished from the ambitious mechanics who make coats and trousers,\r\nand Uncle Chris was his best customer. Similarly, London is full of\r\nyoung fellows trying to get along by the manufacture of foot-wear, but\r\nthere is only one boot-maker in the true meaning of the word,—the one\r\nwho supplied Uncle Chris. And, as for hats, while it is no doubt a fact\r\nthat you can get at plenty of London shops some sort of covering for\r\nyour head which will keep it warm, the only hatter—using the term in\r\nits deeper sense—is the man who enjoyed the patronage of Major\r\nChristopher Selby. From foot to head, in short, from furthest South to\r\nextremest North, Uncle Chris was perfect. He was an ornament to his\r\nsurroundings. The Metropolis looked better for him. One seems to\r\npicture London as a mother with a horde of untidy children, children\r\nwith made-up ties, children with wrinkled coats and baggy trouser-legs,\r\nsighing to herself as she beheld them, then cheering up and murmuring\r\nwith a touch of restored complacency, “Ah, well, I still have Uncle\r\nChris!”\r\n\r\n“Miss Bryant is American, Uncle Chris,” said Jill.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris spread his shapely legs before the fire, and glanced down\r\nkindly at Nelly.\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” He took a cup of tea and stirred it. “I was in America as a\r\nyoung man.”\r\n\r\n“Whereabouts?” asked Nelly eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, here and there and everywhere. I travelled considerably.”\r\n\r\n“That’s how it is with me,” said Nelly, overcoming her diffidence as\r\nshe warmed to the favorite topic. “I guess I know most every town in\r\nevery State, from New York to the last one-night stand. It’s a great\r\nold country, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“It is!” said Uncle Chris. “I shall be returning there very shortly.”\r\nHe paused meditatively. “Very shortly indeed.”\r\n\r\nNelly bit her lip. It seemed to be her fate today to meet people who\r\nwere going to America.\r\n\r\n“When did you decide to do that?” asked Jill.\r\n\r\nShe had been looking at him, puzzled. Years of association with Uncle\r\nChris had enabled her to read his moods quickly, and she was sure that\r\nthere was something on his mind. It was not likely that the others had\r\nnoticed it, for his manner was as genial and urbane as ever. But\r\nsomething about him, a look in his eyes that came and went, an\r\noccasional quick twitching of his mouth, told her that all was not\r\nwell. She was a little troubled, but not greatly. Uncle Chris was not\r\nthe sort of man to whom grave tragedies happened. It was probably some\r\nmere trifle which she could smooth out for him in five minutes, once\r\nthey were alone together. She reached out and patted his sleeve\r\naffectionately. She was fonder of Uncle Chris than of anyone in the\r\nworld except Derek.\r\n\r\n“The thought,” said Uncle Chris, “came to me this morning, as I read my\r\nmorning paper while breakfasting. It has grown and developed during the\r\nday. At this moment you might almost call it an obsession. I am very\r\nfond of America. I spent several happy years there. On that occasion, I\r\nset sail for the land of promise, I admit, somewhat reluctantly. Of my\r\nown free will I might never have made the expedition. But the general\r\nsentiment seemed so strongly in favor of my doing so that I yielded to\r\nwhat I might call a public demand. The willing hands for my nearest and\r\ndearest were behind me, pushing, and I did not resist them. I have\r\nnever regretted it. America is a part of every young man’s education.\r\nYou ought to go there, Freddie.”\r\n\r\n“Rummily enough,” said Freddie, “I was saying just before you came in\r\nthat I had half a mind to pop over. Only it’s rather a bally fag,\r\nstarting. Getting your luggage packed and all that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nNelly, whose luggage consisted of one small trunk, heaved a silent\r\nsigh. Mingling with the idle rich carried its penalties.\r\n\r\n“America,” said Uncle Chris, “taught me poker, for which I can never be\r\nsufficiently grateful. Also an exotic pastime styled Craps,—or,\r\nalternatively, ‘rolling the bones’—which in those days was a very\r\npresent help in time of trouble. At Craps, I fear, my hand in late\r\nyears had lost much of its cunning. I have had little opportunity of\r\npractising. But as a young man I was no mean exponent of the art. Let\r\nme see,” said Uncle Chris meditatively. “What was the precise ritual?\r\nAh! I have it, ‘Come, little seven!’”\r\n\r\n“‘Come, eleven!’” exclaimed Nelly excitedly.\r\n\r\n“‘Baby …’ I feel convinced that in some manner the word baby entered\r\ninto it.”\r\n\r\n“‘Baby needs new shoes!’”\r\n\r\n“‘Baby needs new shoes!’ Precisely!”\r\n\r\n“It sounds to me,” said Freddie, “dashed silly.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” cried Nelly reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“Well, what I mean to say is, there’s no sense in it, don’t you know.”\r\n\r\n“It is a noble pursuit,” said Uncle Chris firmly. “Worthy of the great\r\nnation that has produced it. No doubt, when I return to America, I\r\nshall have opportunities of recovering my lost skill.”\r\n\r\n“You aren’t returning to America,” said Jill. “You’re going to stay\r\nsafe at home like a good little uncle. I’m not going to have you\r\nrunning wild all over the world at your age.”\r\n\r\n“Age?” declaimed Uncle Chris. “What is my age? At the present moment I\r\nfeel in the neighborhood of twenty-one, and Ambition is tapping me on\r\nthe shoulder and whispering ‘Young man, go West!’ The years are\r\nslipping away from me, my dear Jill,—slipping so quickly that in a few\r\nminutes you will be wondering why my nurse does not come to fetch me.\r\nThe wanderlust is upon me. I gaze around me at all this prosperity in\r\nwhich I am lapped,” said Uncle Chris, eyeing the arm-chair severely,\r\n“all this comfort and luxury which swaddles me, and I feel staggered. I\r\nwant activity. I want to be braced!”\r\n\r\n“You would hate it,” said Jill composedly. “You know you’re the laziest\r\nold darling in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly what I am endeavoring to point out. I am lazy. Or, I was till\r\nthis morning.”\r\n\r\n“Something very extraordinary must have happened this morning. I can\r\nsee that.”\r\n\r\n“I wallowed in gross comfort. I was what Shakespeare calls a ‘fat and\r\ngreasy citizen’!”\r\n\r\n“Please, Uncle Chris!” protested Jill. “Not while I’m eating buttered\r\ntoast!”\r\n\r\n“But now I am myself again.”\r\n\r\n“That’s splendid.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard the beat of the off-shore wind,” chanted Uncle Chris,\r\n“and the thresh of the deep-sea rain. I have heard the song—How long!\r\nhow long! Pull out on the trail again!”\r\n\r\n“He can also recite ‘Gunga Din,’” said Jill to Nelly. “I really must\r\napologize for all this. He’s usually as good as gold.”\r\n\r\n“I believe I know how he feels,” said Nelly softly.\r\n\r\n“Of course you do. You and I, Miss Bryant, are of the gipsies of the\r\nworld. We are not vegetables like young Rooke here.”\r\n\r\n“Eh, what?” said the vegetable, waking from a reverie. He had been\r\nwatching Nelly’s face. Its wistfulness attracted him.\r\n\r\n“We are only happy,” proceeded Uncle Chris, “when we are wandering.”\r\n\r\n“You should see Uncle Chris wander to his club in the morning,” said\r\nJill. “He trudges off in a taxi, singing wild gipsy songs, absolutely\r\ndefying fatigue.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Uncle Chris, “is a perfectly justified slur. I shudder at\r\nthe depths to which prosperity has caused me to sink.” He expanded his\r\nchest. “I shall be a different man in America. America would make a\r\ndifferent man of you, Freddie.”\r\n\r\n“I’m all right, thanks!” said that easily satisfied young man.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris turned to Nelly, pointing dramatically.\r\n\r\n“Young woman, go West! Return to your bracing home, and leave this\r\nenervating London! You …”\r\n\r\nNelly got up abruptly. She could endure no more.\r\n\r\n“I believe I’ll have to be going now,” she said. “Bill misses me if I’m\r\naway long. Good-bye. Thank you ever so much for what you did.”\r\n\r\n“It was awfully kind of you to come round,” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Major Selby.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Mr Rooke.”\r\n\r\nFreddie awoke from another reverie.\r\n\r\n“Eh? Oh, I say, half a jiffy. I think I may as well be toddling along\r\nmyself. About time I was getting back to dress for dinner and all that.\r\nSee you home, may I, and then I’ll get a taxi at Victoria. Toodle-oo,\r\neverybody.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFreddie escorted Nelly through the hall and opened the front door for\r\nher. The night was cool and cloudy, and there was still in the air that\r\nodd, rejuvenating suggestion of Spring. A wet fragrance came from the\r\ndripping trees.\r\n\r\n“Topping evening!” said Freddie conversationally.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThey walked through the square in silence. Freddie shot an appreciative\r\nglance at his companion. Freddie, as he would have admitted frankly,\r\nwas not much of a lad for the modern girl. The modern girl, he\r\nconsidered, was too dashed rowdy and exuberant for a chappie of\r\npeaceful tastes. Now, this girl, on the other hand, had all the\r\nearmarks of being something of a topper. She had a soft voice. Rummy\r\naccent and all that, but nevertheless a soft and pleasing voice. She\r\nwas mild and unaggressive, and these were qualities which Freddie\r\nesteemed. Freddie, though this was a thing he would not have admitted,\r\nwas afraid of girls, the sort of girls he had to take down to dinner\r\nand dance with and so forth. They were too dashed clever, and always\r\nseemed to be waiting for a chance to score off a fellow. This one was\r\nnot like that. Not a bit. She was gentle and quiet and what not.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that it came home to him how remarkably quiet she\r\nwas. She had not said a word for the last five minutes. He was just\r\nabout to break the silence, when, as they passed under a street lamp,\r\nhe perceived that she was crying,—crying very softly to herself, like a\r\nchild in the dark.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” said Freddie, appalled. There were two things in life with\r\nwhich he felt totally unable to cope,—crying girls and dog-fights. The\r\nglimpse he had caught of Nelly’s face froze him into a speechlessness\r\nwhich lasted until they reached Daubeny Street and stopped at her door.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Nelly.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye-ee!” said Freddie mechanically. “That’s to say, I mean to\r\nsay, half a second!” he added quickly. He faced her nervously, with one\r\nhand on the grimy railings. This wanted looking into. When it came to\r\ngirls trickling to and fro in the public streets, weeping, well, it was\r\npretty rotten and something had to be done about it. “What’s up?” he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear old soul,” said Freddie, clutching the railing for moral\r\nsupport, “it _is_ something. It must be! You might not think it, to\r\nlook at me, but I’m really rather a dashed shrewd chap, and I can _see_\r\nthere’s something up. Why not give me the jolly old scenario and see if\r\nwe can’t do something?”\r\n\r\nNelly moved as if to turn to the door, then stopped. She was thoroughly\r\nashamed of herself.\r\n\r\n“I’m a fool!”\r\n\r\n“No, no!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am. I don’t often act this way, but, oh, gee! hearing you all\r\ntalking like that about going to America, just as if it was the easiest\r\nthing in the world, only you couldn’t be bothered to do it, kind of got\r\nme going. And to think I could be there right now if I wasn’t a\r\nbonehead!”\r\n\r\n“A bonehead?”\r\n\r\n“A simp. I’m all right as far up as the string of near-pearls, but\r\nabove that I’m reinforced concrete.”\r\n\r\nFreddie groped for her meaning.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean you’ve made a bloomer of some kind?”\r\n\r\n“I pulled the worst kind of bone. I stopped on in London when the rest\r\nof the company went back home, and now I’ve got to stick.”\r\n\r\n“Rush of jolly old professional engagement, what?”\r\n\r\nNelly laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n“You’re a bad guesser. No, they haven’t started to fight over me yet.\r\nI’m at liberty, as they say in the Era.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear old thing,” said Freddie earnestly, “if you’ve got\r\nnothing to keep you in England, why not pop back to America? I mean to\r\nsay, home-sickness is the most dashed blighted thing in the world.\r\nThere’s nothing gives one the pip to such an extent. Why, dash it, I\r\nremember staying with an old aunt of mine up in Scotland the year\r\nbefore last and not being able to get away for three weeks or so, and I\r\nraved—absolutely gibbered—for a sight of the merry old metrop.\r\nSometimes I’d wake up in the night, thinking I was back at the Albany,\r\nand, by Jove, when I found I wasn’t I howled like a dog! You take my\r\ntip, old soul, and pop back on the next boat.”\r\n\r\n“Which line?”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean, which line? Oh, I see, you mean which line? Well …\r\nwell … I’ve never been on any of them, so it’s rather hard to say. But\r\nI hear the Cunard well spoken of, and then again some chappies swear by\r\nthe White Star. But I should imagine you can’t go far wrong, whichever\r\nyou pick. They’re all pretty ripe, I fancy.”\r\n\r\n“Which of them is giving free trips? That’s the point.”\r\n\r\n“Eh? Oh!” Her meaning dawned upon Freddie. He regarded her with deep\r\nconsternation. Life had treated him so kindly that he had almost\r\nforgotten that there existed a class which had not as much money as\r\nhimself. Sympathy welled up beneath his perfectly fitting waistcoat. It\r\nwas a purely disinterested sympathy. The fact that Nelly was a girl and\r\nin many respects a dashed pretty girl did not affect him. What mattered\r\nwas that she was hard up. The thought hurt Freddie like a blow. He\r\nhated the idea of anyone being hard up.\r\n\r\n“I say!” he said. “Are you broke?”\r\n\r\nNelly laughed.\r\n\r\n“Am I! If dollars were doughnuts, I wouldn’t even have the hole in the\r\nmiddle.”\r\n\r\nFreddie was stirred to his depths. Except for the beggars in the\r\nstreets, to whom he gave shillings, he had not met anyone for years who\r\nhad not plenty of money. He had friends at his clubs who frequently\r\nclaimed to be unable to lay their hands on a bally penny, but the bally\r\npenny they wanted to lay their hands on generally turned out to be a\r\ncouple of thousand pounds for a new car.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” he said.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then, with a sudden impulse, he began to fumble in\r\nhis breast-pocket. Rummy how things worked out for the best, however\r\nscaly they might seem at the moment. Only an hour or so ago he had been\r\nkicking himself for not having remembered that fifty-pound note, tacked\r\nonto the lining of his coat, when it would have come in handy at the\r\npolice-station. He now saw that Providence had had the matter well in\r\nhand. If he had remembered it and coughed it up to the constabulary\r\nthen, he wouldn’t have had it now. And he needed it now. A mood of\r\nquixotic generosity had surged upon him. With swift fingers he jerked\r\nthe note free from its moorings and displayed it like a conjurer\r\nexhibiting a rabbit.\r\n\r\n“My dear old thing,” he said, “I can’t stand it! I absolutely cannot\r\nstick it at any price! I really must insist on your trousering this.\r\nPositively!”\r\n\r\nNelly Bryant gazed at the note with wide eyes. She was stunned. She\r\ntook it limply, and looked at it under the dim light of the gas-lamp\r\nover the door.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t!” she cried.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but really! You must!”\r\n\r\n“But this is a fifty-pound!”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely! It will take you back to New York, what? You asked which\r\nline was giving free trips. The Freddie Rooke Line, by Jove, sailings\r\nevery Wednesday and Saturday! I mean, what!”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t take two hundred and fifty dollars from you!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, rather. Of course you can.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause.\r\n\r\n“You’ll think—” Nelly’s pale face flushed. “You’ll think I told you all\r\nabout myself just—just because I wanted to …”\r\n\r\n“To make a touch? Absolutely not! Kid yourself of the jolly old\r\nsuperstition entirely. You see before you, old thing, a chappie who\r\nknows more about borrowing money than any man in London. I mean to say,\r\nI’ve had my ear bitten more often than anyone, I should think. There\r\nare sixty-four ways of making a touch—I’ve had them all worked on me by\r\ndivers blighters here and there—and I can tell any of them with my eyes\r\nshut. I know you weren’t dreaming of any such thing.”\r\n\r\nThe note crackled musically in Nelly’s hand.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to say!”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why … Gee! I wish I could tell you what I think of you!”\r\n\r\nFreddie laughed amusedly.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” he said, “that’s exactly what the beaks—the masters, you\r\nknow,—used to say to me at school.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you can spare it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, rather.”\r\n\r\nNelly’s eyes shone in the light of the lamp.\r\n\r\n“I’ve never met anyone like you before. I don’t know how …”\r\n\r\nFreddie shuffled nervously. Being thanked always made him feel pretty\r\nrotten.\r\n\r\n“Well, I think I’ll be popping,” he said. “Got to get back and dress\r\nand all that. Awfully glad to have seen you, and all that sort of rot.”\r\n\r\nNelly unlocked the door with her latchkey, and stood on the step.\r\n\r\n“I’ll buy a fur-wrap,” she said, half to herself.\r\n\r\n“Great wheeze! I should!”\r\n\r\n“And some nuts for Bill!”\r\n\r\n“Bill?”\r\n\r\n“The parrot.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the jolly old parrot! Rather! Well, cheerio!”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye … You’ve been awfully good to me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Freddie uncomfortably. “Any time you’re passing … !”\r\n\r\n“Awfully good … Well, good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Toodle-oo!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe we’ll meet again some day.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. Absolutely!”\r\n\r\nThere was a little scurry of feet. Something warm and soft pressed for\r\nan instant against Freddie’s cheek, and, as he stumbled back, Nelly\r\nBryant skipped up the steps and vanished through the door.\r\n\r\n“Good God!”\r\n\r\nFreddie felt his cheek. He was aware of an odd mixture of embarrassment\r\nand exhilaration.\r\n\r\nFrom the area below a slight cough sounded. Freddie turned sharply. A\r\nmaid in a soiled cap, worn coquettishly over one ear, was gazing\r\nintently up through the railings. Their eyes met. Freddie turned a warm\r\npink. It seemed to him that the maid had the air of one about to\r\ngiggle.\r\n\r\n“Damn!” said Freddie softly, and hurried off down the street. He\r\nwondered whether he had made a frightful ass of himself, spraying\r\nbank-notes all over the place like that to comparative strangers. Then\r\na vision came to him of Nelly’s eyes as they had looked at him in the\r\nlamp-light, and he decided—no, absolutely not. Rummy as the gadget\r\nmight appear, it had been the right thing to do. It was a binge of\r\nwhich he thoroughly approved. A good egg!\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nJill, when Freddie and Nelly left the room, had seated herself on a low\r\nstool, and sat, looking thoughtfully into the fire. She was wondering\r\nif she had been mistaken in supposing that Uncle Chris was worried\r\nabout something. This restlessness of his, this desire for movement,\r\nwas strange in him. Hitherto he had been like a dear old cosy cat,\r\nrevelling in the comfort which he had just denounced so eloquently. She\r\nwatched him as he took up his favorite stand in front of the fire.\r\n\r\n“Nice girl,” said Uncle Chris. “Who was she?”\r\n\r\n“Somebody Freddie met,” said Jill diplomatically. There was no need to\r\nworry Uncle Chris with details of the afternoon’s happenings.\r\n\r\n“Very nice girl.” Uncle Chris took out his cigar-case. “No need to ask\r\nif I may, thank goodness.” He lit a cigar. “Do you remember, Jill,\r\nyears ago, when you were quite small, how I used to blow smoke in your\r\nface?”\r\n\r\nJill smiled.\r\n\r\n“Of course I do. You said that you were training me for marriage. You\r\nsaid that there were no happy marriages except where the wife didn’t\r\nmind the smell of tobacco. Well, it’s lucky, as a matter of fact, for\r\nDerek smokes all the time.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris took up his favorite stand against the fireplace.\r\n\r\n“You’re very fond of Derek, aren’t you, Jill?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I am. You are, too, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Fine chap. Very fine chap. Plenty of money, too. It’s a great relief,”\r\nsaid Uncle Chris, puffing vigorously. “A thundering relief.” He looked\r\nover Jill’s head down the room. “It’s fine to think of you happily\r\nmarried, dear, with everything in the world that you want.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris’ gaze wandered down to where Jill sat. A slight mist\r\naffected his eyesight. Jill had provided a solution for the great\r\nproblem of his life. Marriage had always appalled him, but there was\r\nthis to be said for it, that married people had daughters. He had\r\nalways wanted a daughter, a smart girl he could take out and be proud\r\nof; and fate had given him Jill at precisely the right age. A child\r\nwould have bored Uncle Chris—he was fond of children, but they made the\r\ndeuce of a noise and regarded jam as an external ornament—but a\r\ndelightful little girl of fourteen was different. Jill and he had been\r\nvery close to each other since her mother had died, a year after the\r\ndeath of her father, and had left her in his charge. He had watched her\r\ngrow up with a joy that had a touch of bewilderment in it—she seemed to\r\ngrow so quickly—and had been fonder and prouder of her at every stage\r\nof her tumultuous career.\r\n\r\n“You’re a dear,” said Jill. She stroked the trouser-leg that was\r\nnearest. “How _do_ you manage to get such a wonderful crease? You\r\nreally are a credit to me!”\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary silence. A shade of embarrassment made itself\r\nnoticeable in Uncle Chris’ frank gaze. He gave a little cough, and\r\npulled at his mustache.\r\n\r\n“I wish I were, my dear,” he said soberly. “I wish I were. I’m afraid\r\nI’m a poor sort of fellow, Jill.”\r\n\r\nJill looked up.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“A poor sort of fellow,” repeated Uncle Chris. “Your mother was foolish\r\nto trust you to me. Your father had more sense. He always said I was a\r\nwrong’un.”\r\n\r\nJill got up quickly. She was certain now that she had been right, and\r\nthat there was something on her uncle’s mind.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Uncle Chris? Something’s happened. What is it?”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris turned to knock the ash off his cigar. The movement gave\r\nhim time to collect himself for what lay before him. He had one of\r\nthose rare volatile natures which can ignore the blows of fate so long\r\nas their effects are not brought home by visible evidence of disaster.\r\nHe lived in the moment, and, though matters had been as bad at\r\nbreakfast-time as they were now, it was not till now, when he\r\nconfronted Jill, that he had found his cheerfulness affected by them.\r\nHe was a man who hated ordeals, and one faced him now. Until this\r\nmoment he had been able to detach his mind from a state of affairs\r\nwhich would have weighed unceasingly upon another man. His mind was a\r\ntelephone which he could cut off at will, when the voice of Trouble\r\nwished to speak. The time would arrive, he had been aware, when he\r\nwould have to pay attention to that voice, but so far he had refused to\r\nlisten. Now it could be evaded no longer.\r\n\r\n“Jill.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris paused again, searching for the best means of saying what\r\nhad to be said.\r\n\r\n“Jill, I don’t know if you understand about these things, but there was\r\nwhat is called a slump on the Stock Exchange this morning. In other\r\nwords …”\r\n\r\nJill laughed.\r\n\r\n“Of course I know all about that,” she said. “Poor Freddie wouldn’t\r\ntalk about anything else till I made him. He was terribly blue when he\r\ngot here this afternoon. He said he had got ‘nipped’ in Amalgamated\r\nDyes. He had lost about two hundred pounds, and was furious with a\r\nfriend of his who had told him to buy margins.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“Jill, I’m afraid I’ve got bad news for you. I bought Amalgamated Dyes,\r\ntoo.” He worried his mustache. “I lost heavily, very heavily.”\r\n\r\n“How naughty of you! You know you oughtn’t to gamble.”\r\n\r\n“Jill, you must be brave. I—I—well, the fact is—it’s no good beating\r\nabout the bush—I lost everything! Everything!”\r\n\r\n“Everything?”\r\n\r\n“Everything! It’s all gone! All fooled away. It’s a terrible business.\r\nThis house will have to go.”\r\n\r\n“But—but doesn’t the house belong to me?”\r\n\r\n“I was your trustee, dear.” Uncle Chris smoked furiously. “Thank heaven\r\nyou’re going to marry a rich man!”\r\n\r\nJill stood looking at him, perplexed. Money, as money, had never\r\nentered into her life. There were things one wanted, which had to be\r\npaid for with money, but Uncle Chris had always looked after that. She\r\nhad taken them for granted.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” she said.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly she realized that she did, and a great wave of pity\r\nfor Uncle Chris flooded over her. He was such an old dear. It must be\r\nhorrible for him to have to stand there, telling her all this. She felt\r\nno sense of injury, only the discomfort of having to witness the\r\nhumiliation of her oldest friend. Uncle Chris was bound up inextricably\r\nwith everything in her life that was pleasant. She could remember him,\r\nlooking exactly the same, only with a thicker and wavier crop of hair,\r\nplaying with her patiently and unwearied for hours in the hot sun, a\r\ncheerful martyr. She could remember sitting up with him when she came\r\nhome from her first grown-up dance, drinking cocoa and talking and\r\ntalking and talking till the birds outside sang the sun high up into\r\nthe sky and it was breakfast-time. She could remember theatres with\r\nhim, and jolly little suppers afterwards; expeditions into the country,\r\nwith lunches at queer old inns; days on the river, days at Hurlingham,\r\ndays at Lords’, days at the Academy. He had always been the same,\r\nalways cheerful, always kind. He was Uncle Chris, and he would always\r\nbe Uncle Chris, whatever he had done or whatever he might do. She\r\nslipped her arm in his and gave it a squeeze.\r\n\r\n“Poor old thing!” she said.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris had been looking straight out before him with those fine\r\nblue eyes of his. There had been just a touch of sternness in his\r\nattitude. A stranger, coming into the room at that moment, would have\r\nsaid that here was a girl trying to coax her blunt, straightforward,\r\nmilitary father into some course of action of which his honest nature\r\ndisapproved. He might have been posing for a statue of Rectitude. As\r\nJill spoke, he seemed to cave in.\r\n\r\n“Poor old thing?” he repeated limply.\r\n\r\n“Of course you are! And stop trying to look dignified and tragic!\r\nBecause it doesn’t suit you. You’re much too well dressed.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear, you don’t understand! You haven’t realized!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do. Yes, I have!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve spent all your money—_your_ money!”\r\n\r\n“I know! What does it matter?”\r\n\r\n“What does it matter! Jill, don’t you hate me?”\r\n\r\n“As if anyone could hate an old darling like you!”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris threw away his cigar, and put his arms round Jill. For a\r\nmoment a dreadful fear came to her that he was going to cry. She prayed\r\nthat he wouldn’t cry. It would be too awful. It would be a memory of\r\nwhich she could never rid herself. She felt as though he were someone\r\nextraordinarily young and unable to look after himself, someone she\r\nmust soothe and protect.\r\n\r\n“Jill,” said Uncle Chris, choking, “you’re—you’re—you’re a little\r\nwarrior!”\r\n\r\nJill kissed him, and moved away. She busied herself with some flowers,\r\nher back turned. The tension had been relieved, and she wanted to give\r\nhim time to recover his poise. She knew him well enough to be sure\r\nthat, sooner or later, the resiliency of his nature would assert\r\nitself. He could never remain long in the depths.\r\n\r\nThe silence had the effect of making her think more clearly than in the\r\nfirst rush of pity she had been able to do. She was able now to review\r\nthe matter as it affected herself. It had not been easy to grasp, the\r\nblunt fact that she was penniless, that all this comfort which\r\nsurrounded her was no longer her own. For an instant a kind of panic\r\nseized her. There was a bleakness about the situation which made one\r\ngasp. It was like icy water dashed in the face. Realization had almost\r\nthe physical pain of life returning to a numbed limb. Her hands shook\r\nas she arranged the flowers, and she had to bite her lip to keep\r\nherself from crying out.\r\n\r\nShe fought panic eye to eye, and beat it down. Uncle Chris, swiftly\r\nrecovering by the fireplace, never knew that the fight had taken place.\r\nHe was feeling quite jovial again now that the unpleasant business of\r\nbreaking the news was over, and was looking on the world with the eye\r\nof a debonair gentleman-adventurer. As far as he was concerned, he told\r\nhimself, this was the best thing that could have happened. He had been\r\ngrowing old and sluggish in prosperity. He needed a fillip. The wits by\r\nwhich he had once lived so merrily had been getting blunt in their easy\r\nretirement. He welcomed the opportunity of matching them once more\r\nagainst the world. He was remorseful as regarded Jill, but the optimist\r\nin him, never crushed for long, told him that Jill would be all right.\r\nShe would step from the sinking ship to the safe refuge of Derek\r\nUnderhill’s wealth and position, while he went out to seek a new life.\r\nUncle Chris’ blue eyes gleamed with a new fire as he pictured himself\r\nin this new life. He felt like a hunter setting out on a hunting\r\nexpedition. There were always adventures and the spoils of war for the\r\nman with brains to find them and gather them in. But it was a mercy\r\nthat Jill had Derek. …\r\n\r\nJill was thinking of Derek, too. Panic had fled, and a curious\r\nexhilaration had seized upon her. If Derek wanted her now, it would be\r\nbecause his love was the strongest thing in the world. She would come\r\nto him like the beggar-maid to Cophetua.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris broke the silence with a cough. At the sound of it, Jill\r\nsmiled again. She knew it for what it was, a sign that he was himself\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Uncle Chris,” she said, “just how bad is it? When you said\r\neverything was gone, did you really mean everything, or were you being\r\nmelodramatic? Exactly how do we stand?”\r\n\r\n“It’s dashed hard to say, my dear. I expect we shall find there are a\r\nfew hundreds left. Enough to see you through till you get married.\r\nAfter that it won’t matter.” Uncle Chris flicked a particle of dust off\r\nhis coat-sleeve. Jill could not help feeling that the action was\r\nsymbolical of his attitude towards life. He flicked away life’s\r\nproblems with just the same airy carelessness. “You mustn’t worry about\r\nme, my dear. I shall be all right. I have made my way in the world\r\nbefore, and I can do it again. I shall go to America and try my luck\r\nthere. Amazing how many opportunities there are in America. Really, as\r\nfar as I am concerned, this is the best thing that could have happened.\r\nI have been getting abominably lazy. If I had gone on living my present\r\nlife for another year or two, why, dash it! I honestly believe I should\r\nhave succumbed to some sort of senile decay. Positively I should have\r\ngot fatty degeneration of the brain! This will be the making of me.”\r\n\r\nJill sat down on the lounge and laughed till there were tears in her\r\neyes. Uncle Chris might be responsible for this disaster, but he was\r\ncertainly making it endurable. However greatly he might be deserving of\r\ncensure, from the standpoint of the sterner morality, he made amends.\r\nIf he brought the whole world crashing in chaos about one’s ears, at\r\nleast he helped one to smile among the ruins.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever read ‘Candide’, Uncle Chris?”\r\n\r\n“‘Candide’?” Uncle Chris shook his head. He was not a great reader,\r\nexcept of the sporting press.\r\n\r\n“It’s a book by Voltaire. There’s a character in it called Doctor\r\nPangloss, who thought that everything was for the best in this best of\r\nall possible worlds.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris felt a touch of embarrassment. It occurred to him that he\r\nhad been betrayed by his mercurial temperament into an attitude which,\r\nconsidering the circumstances, was perhaps a trifle too jubilant. He\r\ngave his mustache a pull, and reverted to the minor key.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you mustn’t think that I don’t appreciate the terrible, the\r\ncriminal thing I have done! I blame myself,” said Uncle Chris\r\ncordially, flicking another speck of dust off his sleeve. “I blame\r\nmyself bitterly. Your mother ought never to have made me your trustee,\r\nmy dear. But she always believed in me, in spite of everything, and\r\nthis is how I have repaid her.” He blew his nose to cover a not unmanly\r\nemotion. “I wasn’t fitted for the position. Never become a trustee,\r\nJill. It’s the devil, is trust money. However much you argue with\r\nyourself, you can’t—dash it, you simply can’t believe that it’s not\r\nyour own, to do as you like with. There it sits, smiling at you, crying\r\n‘Spend me! Spend me!’ and you find yourself dipping—dipping—till one\r\nday there’s nothing left to dip for—only a far-off rustling—the ghosts\r\nof dead bank-notes. That’s how it was with me. The process was almost\r\nautomatic. I hardly knew it was going on. Here a little—there a little.\r\nIt was like snow melting on a mountain-top. And one morning—all gone!”\r\nUncle Chris drove the point home with a gesture. “I did what I could.\r\nWhen I found that there were only a few hundreds left, for your sake I\r\ntook a chance. All heart and no head! There you have Christopher Selby\r\nin a nutshell! A man at the club—a fool named—I’ve forgotten his damn\r\nname—recommended Amalgamated Dyestuffs as a speculation. Monroe, that\r\nwas his name, Jimmy Monroe. He talked about the future of British Dyes\r\nnow that Germany was out of the race, and … well, the long and short of\r\nit was that I took his advice and bought on margin. Bought like the\r\ndevil. And this morning Amalgamated Dyestuffs went all to blazes. There\r\nyou have the whole story!”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Jill, “comes the sequel!”\r\n\r\n“The sequel?” said Uncle Chris breezily. “Happiness, my dear,\r\nhappiness! Wedding bells and—and all that sort of thing!” He straddled\r\nthe hearth-rug manfully, and swelled his chest out. He would permit no\r\npessimism on this occasion of rejoicing. “You don’t suppose that the\r\nfact of your having lost your money—that is to say—er—of _my_ having\r\nlost your money—will affect a splendid young fellow like Derek\r\nUnderhill? I know him better than to think that! I’ve always liked him.\r\nHe’s a man you can trust! Besides,” he added reflectively, “there’s no\r\nneed to tell him! Till after the wedding, I mean. It won’t be hard to\r\nkeep up appearances here for a month or so.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I must tell him!”\r\n\r\n“You think it wise?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about it being wise. It’s the only thing to do. I must\r\nsee him tonight. Oh, I forgot. He was going away this afternoon for a\r\nday or two.”\r\n\r\n“Capital! It will give you time to think it over.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to think it over. There’s nothing to think about.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, yes, of course. Quite so.”\r\n\r\n“I shall write him a letter.”\r\n\r\n“Write, eh?”\r\n\r\n“It’s easier to put what one wants to say in a letter.”\r\n\r\n“Letters,” began Uncle Chris, and stopped as the door opened. Jane the\r\nparlormaid entered, carrying a salver. “For me?” asked Uncle Chris.\r\n\r\n“For Miss Jill, sir.”\r\n\r\nJill took the note off the salver.\r\n\r\n“It’s from Derek.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a messenger-boy waiting, miss,” said Jane. “He wasn’t told if\r\nthere was an answer.”\r\n\r\n“If the note is from Derek,” said Uncle Chris, “it’s not likely to want\r\nan answer. You said he left town today.”\r\n\r\nJill opened the envelope.\r\n\r\n“Is there an answer, miss?” asked Jane, after what she considered a\r\nsuitable interval. She spoke tenderly. She was a great admirer of\r\nDerek, and considered it a pretty action on his part to send notes like\r\nthis when he was compelled to leave London.\r\n\r\n“Any answer, Jill?”\r\n\r\nJill seemed to rouse herself. She had turned oddly pale.\r\n\r\n“No, no answer, Jane.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, miss,” said Jane, and went off to tell cook that in her\r\nopinion Jill was lacking in heart. “It might have been a bill instead\r\nof a love-letter,” said Jane to the cook with indignation, “the way she\r\nread it. _I_ like people to have a little feeling!”\r\n\r\nJill sat turning the letter over and over in her fingers. Her face was\r\nvery white. There seemed to be a big, heavy, leaden something inside\r\nher. A cold hand clutched her throat. Uncle Chris, who at first had\r\nnoticed nothing untoward, now began to find the silence sinister.\r\n\r\n“No bad news, I hope, dear?”\r\n\r\nJill turned the letter between her fingers.\r\n\r\n“Jill, is it bad news?”\r\n\r\n“Derek has broken off the engagement,” said Jill in a dull voice. She\r\nlet the note fall to the floor, and sat with her chin in her hands.\r\n\r\n“What!” Uncle Chris leaped from the hearth-rug, as though the fire had\r\nsuddenly scorched him. “What did you say?”\r\n\r\n“He’s broken it off.”\r\n\r\n“The hound!” cried Uncle Chris. “The blackguard! The—the—I never liked\r\nthat man! I never trusted him!” He fumed for a moment. “But—but—it\r\nisn’t possible. How can he have heard about what’s happened? He\r\ncouldn’t know. It’s—it’s—it isn’t possible!”\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t know. It has nothing to do with that.”\r\n\r\n“But …” Uncle Chris stooped to where the note lay. “May I … ?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you can read it if you like.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris produced a pair of reading-glasses, and glared through them\r\nat the sheet of paper as though it were some loathsome insect.\r\n\r\n“The hound! The cad! If I were a younger man,” shouted Uncle Chris,\r\nsmiting the letter violently, “if I were … Jill! My dear little Jill!”\r\n\r\nHe plunged down on his knees beside her, as she buried her face in her\r\nhands and began to sob.\r\n\r\n“My little girl! Damn that man! My dear little girl! The cad! The\r\ndevil! My own darling little girl! I’ll thrash him within an inch of\r\nhis life!”\r\n\r\nThe clock on the mantelpiece ticked away the minutes. Jill got up. Her\r\nface was wet and quivering, but her mouth had set in a brave line.\r\n\r\n“Jill, dear!”\r\n\r\nShe let his hand close over hers.\r\n\r\n“Everything’s happening all at once this afternoon, Uncle Chris, isn’t\r\nit!” She smiled a twisted smile. “You look so funny! Your hair’s all\r\nrumpled, and your glasses are over on one side!”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris breathed heavily through his nose.\r\n\r\n“When I meet that man …” he began portentously.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what’s the good of bothering! It’s not worth it! Nothing’s worth\r\nit!” Jill stopped, and faced him, her hands clenched. “Let’s get away!\r\nLet’s get right away! I want to get right away, Uncle Chris! Take me\r\naway! Anywhere! Take me to America with you! I must get away!”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris raised his right hand, and shook it. His reading-glasses,\r\nhanging from his left ear, bobbed drunkenly.\r\n\r\n“We’ll sail by the next boat! The very next boat, dammit! I’ll take\r\ncare of you, dear. I’ve been a blackguard to you, my little girl. I’ve\r\nrobbed you, and swindled you. But I’ll make up for it, by George! I’ll\r\nmake up for it! I’ll give you a new home, as good as this, if I die for\r\nit. There’s nothing I won’t do! Nothing! By Jove!” shouted Uncle Chris,\r\nraising his voice in a red-hot frenzy of emotion, “I’ll work! Yes, by\r\nGad, if it comes right down to it, I’ll work!”\r\n\r\nHe brought his fist down with a crash on the table where Derek’s\r\nflowers stood in their bowl. The bowl leaped in the air and tumbled\r\nover, scattering the flowers on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nIn the lives of each one of us, as we look back and review them in\r\nretrospect, there are certain desert wastes from which memory winces\r\nlike some tired traveller faced with a dreary stretch of road. Even\r\nfrom the security of later happiness we cannot contemplate them without\r\na shudder. Time robs our sorrows of their sharp vividness, but the\r\nhorror of those blank, gray days never wholly passes. It remains for\r\never at the back of our consciousness to remind us that, though we may\r\nhave struggled through it to the heights, there is an abyss. We may\r\ndwell, like the Pilgrim, on the Delectable Mountains, but we never\r\nforget the Slough of Despond. Years afterwards, Jill could not bring\r\nherself to think of that brief but age-long period which lay between\r\nthe evening when she read Derek’s letter and the morning when, with the\r\nwet sea-wind in her face and the cry of the wheeling sea-gulls in her\r\nears, she stood on the deck of the liner that was taking her to the\r\nland where she could begin a new life. It brooded behind her like a\r\ngreat, dank cloud, shutting out the sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of modern life are singularly inimical to swift and\r\ndramatic action when we wish to escape from surroundings that have\r\nbecome intolerable. In the old days, your hero would leap on his\r\ncharger and ride out into the sunset. Now, he is compelled to remain\r\nfor a week or so to settle his affairs,—especially if he is an Uncle\r\nChris—and has got those affairs into such a tangle that hardened\r\nlawyers knit their brows at the sight of them. It took one of the most\r\ncompetent firms in the metropolis four days to produce some sort of\r\norder in the confusion resulting from Major Selby’s financial\r\noperations; and during those days Jill existed in a state of being\r\nwhich could be defined as living only in that she breathed and ate and\r\ncomported herself outwardly like a girl and not a ghost.\r\n\r\nBoards announcing that the house was for sale appeared against the\r\nrailings through which Jane the parlormaid conducted her daily\r\nconversations with the tradesmen. Strangers roamed the rooms eyeing and\r\nappraising the furniture. Uncle Chris, on whom disaster had had a\r\nquickening and vivifying effect, was everywhere at once, an impressive\r\nfigure of energy. One may be wronging Uncle Chris, but to the eye of\r\nthe casual observer he seemed in these days of trial to be having the\r\ntime of his life.\r\n\r\nJill varied the monotony of sitting in her room—which was the only\r\nplace in the house where one might be sure of not encountering a\r\nfurniture-broker’s man with a note-book and pencil—by taking long\r\nwalks. She avoided as far as possible the small area which had once\r\nmade up the whole of London for her, but even so she was not always\r\nsuccessful in escaping from old acquaintances. Once, cutting through\r\nLennox Gardens on her way to that vast, desolate King’s Road which\r\nstretches its length out into regions unknown to those whose London is\r\nthe West End, she happened upon Freddie Rooke, who had been paying a\r\ncall in his best hat and a pair of white spats which would have cut his\r\nfriend Henry to the quick. It was not an enjoyable meeting. Freddie,\r\nkeenly alive to the awkwardness of the situation, was scarlet and\r\nincoherent; and Jill, who desired nothing less than to talk with one so\r\nintimately connected in her mind with all that she had lost, was\r\nscarcely more collected. They parted without regret. The only\r\nsatisfaction that came to Jill from the encounter was the knowledge\r\nthat Derek was still out of town. He had wired for his things, said\r\nFreddie and had retreated further north. Freddie, it seemed, had been\r\ninformed of the broken engagement by Lady Underhill in an interview\r\nwhich appeared to have left a lasting impression on his mind. Of Jill’s\r\nmonetary difficulties he had heard nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter this meeting, Jill felt a slight diminution of the oppression\r\nwhich weighed upon her. She could not have borne to have come\r\nunexpectedly upon Derek, and, now that there was no danger of that, she\r\nfound life a little easier. The days passed somehow, and finally there\r\ncame the morning when, accompanied by Uncle Chris—voluble and\r\nexplanatory about the details of what he called “getting everything\r\nsettled”—she rode in a taxi to take the train for Southampton. Her last\r\nimpression of London was of rows upon rows of mean houses, of cats\r\nwandering in back-yards among groves of home-washed underclothing, and\r\na smoky grayness which gave way, as the train raced on, to the clearer\r\ngray of the suburbs and the good green and brown of the open country.\r\n\r\nThen the bustle and confusion of the liner; the calm monotony of the\r\njourney, when one came on deck each morning to find the vessel so\r\nmanifestly in the same spot where it had been the morning before that\r\nit was impossible to realize how many hundred miles of ocean had really\r\nbeen placed behind one; and finally the Ambrose Channel lightship and\r\nthe great bulk of New York rising into the sky like a city of\r\nfairyland, heartening yet sinister, at once a welcome and a menace.\r\n\r\n“There you are, my dear!” said Uncle Chris indulgently, as though it\r\nwere a toy he had made for her with his own hands. “New York!”\r\n\r\nThey were standing on the boat-deck, leaning over the rail. Jill caught\r\nher breath. For the first time since disaster had come upon her she was\r\nconscious of a rising of her spirits. It is impossible to behold the\r\nhuge buildings which fringe the harbor of New York without a sense of\r\nexpectancy and excitement. There had remained in Jill’s mind from\r\nchildhood memories a vague picture of what she now saw, but it had been\r\nfeeble and inadequate. The sight of this towering city seemed somehow\r\nto blot out everything that had gone before. The feeling of starting\r\nafresh was strong upon her.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris, the old traveller, was not emotionally affected. He smoked\r\nplacidly and talked in a wholly earthy strain of grape-fruit and\r\nbuckwheat cakes.\r\n\r\nIt was now, also for the first time, that Uncle Chris touched upon\r\nfuture prospects in a practical manner. On the voyage he had been\r\neloquent but sketchy. With the land of promise within biscuit-throw and\r\nthe tugs bustling about the great liner’s skirts like little dogs about\r\ntheir mistress, he descended to details.\r\n\r\n“I shall get a room somewhere,” said Uncle Chris, “and start looking\r\nabout me. I wonder if the old Holland House is still there. I fancy I\r\nheard they’d pulled it down. Capital place. I had a steak there in the\r\nyear … But I expect they’ve pulled it down. But I shall find somewhere\r\nto go. I’ll write and tell you my address directly I’ve got one.”\r\n\r\nJill removed her gaze from the sky-line with a start.\r\n\r\n“Write to me?”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I tell you about that?” said Uncle Chris cheerily,—avoiding her\r\neye, however, for he had realized all along that it might be a little\r\nbit awkward breaking the news. “I’ve arranged that you shall go and\r\nstay for the time being down at Brookport—on Long Island, you know—over\r\nin that direction—with your Uncle Elmer. Daresay you’ve forgotten you\r\nhave an Uncle Elmer, eh?” he went on quickly, as Jill was about to\r\nspeak. “Your father’s brother. Used to be in business, but retired some\r\nyears ago and goes in for amateur farming. Corn and—and corn,” said\r\nUncle Chris. “All that sort of thing. You’ll like him. Capital chap!\r\nNever met him myself, but always heard,” said Uncle Chris, who had\r\nnever to his recollection heard any comments upon Mr Elmer Mariner\r\nwhatever, “that he was a splendid fellow. Directly we decided to sail,\r\nI cabled to him, and got an answer saying that he would be delighted to\r\nput you up. You’ll be quite happy there.”\r\n\r\nJill listened to this programme with dismay. New York was calling to\r\nher, and Brookport held out no attractions at all. She looked down over\r\nthe side at the tugs puffing their way through the broken blocks of ice\r\nthat reminded her of a cocoanut candy familiar to her childhood.\r\n\r\n“But I want to be with you,” she protested.\r\n\r\n“Impossible, my dear, for the present. I shall be very busy, very busy\r\nindeed for some weeks, until I have found my feet. Really, you would be\r\nin the way. He—er—travels the fastest who travels alone! I must be in a\r\nposition to go anywhere and do anything at a moment’s notice. But\r\nalways remember, my dear,” said Uncle Chris, patting her shoulder\r\naffectionately, “that I shall be working for you. I have treated you\r\nvery badly, but I intend to make up for it. I shall not forget that\r\nwhatever money I may make will really belong to you.” He looked at her\r\nbenignly, like a monarch of finance who has ear-marked a million or two\r\nfor the benefit of a deserving charity. “You shall have it all, Jill.”\r\n\r\nHe had so much the air of having conferred a substantial benefit upon\r\nher that Jill felt obliged to thank him. Uncle Chris had always been\r\nable to make people grateful for the phantom gold which he showered\r\nupon them. He was as lavish a man with the money he was going to get\r\nnext week as ever borrowed a five-pound note to see him through till\r\nSaturday.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do, Uncle Chris?” asked Jill curiously. Apart\r\nfrom a nebulous idea that he intended to saunter through the city\r\npicking dollar-bills off the sidewalk, she had no inkling of his plans.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris toyed with his short mustache. He was not quite equal to a\r\ndirect answer on the spur of the moment. He had a faith in his star.\r\nSomething would turn up. Something always had turned up in the old\r\ndays, and doubtless, with the march of civilization, opportunities had\r\nmultiplied. Somewhere behind those tall buildings the Goddess of Luck\r\nawaited him, her hands full of gifts, but precisely what those gifts\r\nwould be he was not in a position to say.\r\n\r\n“I shall—ah—how shall I put it—?”\r\n\r\n“Look round?” suggested Jill.\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” said Uncle Chris gratefully. “Look round. I daresay you\r\nhave noticed that I have gone out of my way during the voyage to make\r\nmyself agreeable to our fellow-travellers? I had an object.\r\nAcquaintances begun on shipboard will often ripen into useful\r\nfriendships ashore. When I was a young man I never neglected the\r\nopportunities which an ocean voyage affords. The offer of a book here,\r\na steamer-rug there, a word of encouragement to a chatty bore in the\r\nsmoke-room—these are small things, but they may lead to much. One meets\r\ninfluential people on a liner. You wouldn’t think it to look at him,\r\nbut that man with the eye-glasses and the thin nose I was talking to\r\njust now is one of the richest men in Milwaukee!”\r\n\r\n“But it’s not much good having rich friends in Milwaukee when you are\r\nin New York!”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. There you have put your finger on the very point I have been\r\ntrying to make. It will probably be necessary for me to travel. And for\r\nthat I must be alone. I must be a mobile force. I should dearly like to\r\nkeep you with me, but you can see for yourself that for the moment you\r\nwould be an encumbrance. Later on, no doubt, when my affairs are more\r\nsettled …”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I understand. I’m resigned. But, oh dear! it’s going to be very\r\ndull down at Brookport.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, nonsense! It’s a delightful spot.”\r\n\r\n“Have you been there?”\r\n\r\n“No! But of course everybody knows Brookport! Healthy, invigorating …\r\nSure to be! The very name … You’ll be as happy as the days are long!”\r\n\r\n“And how long the days will be!”\r\n\r\n“Come, come! You mustn’t look on the dark side!”\r\n\r\n“Is there another?” Jill laughed. “You are an old hum-bug, Uncle Chris.\r\nYou know perfectly well what you’re condemning me to! I expect\r\nBrookport will be like a sort of Southend in winter. Oh, well, I’ll be\r\nbrave. But do hurry and make a fortune, because I want to come to New\r\nYork.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said Uncle Chris solemnly, “if there is a dollar lying loose\r\nin this city, rest assured that I shall have it! And, if it’s not\r\nloose, I will detach it with the greatest possible speed. You have only\r\nknown me in my decadence, an idle and unprofitable London clubman. I\r\ncan assure you that, lurking beneath the surface, there is a business\r\nacumen given to few men …”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you are going to talk poetry,” said Jill, “I’ll leave you.\r\nAnyhow, I ought to be getting below and putting my things together.\r\nSubject for a historical picture,—The Belle of Brookport collecting a\r\nfew simple necessaries before entering upon the conquest of America.”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nIf Jill’s vision of Brookport as a wintery Southend was not entirely\r\nfulfilled, neither was Uncle Chris’ picture of it as an earthly\r\nparadise. At the right time of the year, like most of the summer\r\nresorts on the south shore of Long Island, it is not without its\r\nattractions; but January is not the month which most people would\r\nchoose for living in it. It presented itself to Jill on first\r\nacquaintance in the aspect of a wind-swept railroad station, dumped\r\ndown far away from human habitation in the middle of a stretch of flat\r\nand ragged country that reminded her a little of parts of Surrey. The\r\nstation was just a shed on a foundation of planks which lay flush with\r\nthe rails. From this shed, as the train clanked in, there emerged a\r\ntall, shambling man in a weather-beaten overcoat. He had a\r\nclean-shaven, wrinkled face, and he looked doubtfully at Jill with\r\nsmall eyes. Something in his expression reminded Jill of her father, as\r\na bad caricature of a public man will recall the original, she\r\nintroduced herself.\r\n\r\n“If you’re Uncle Elmer,” she said, “I’m Jill.”\r\n\r\nThe man held out a long hand. He did not smile. He was as bleak as the\r\neast wind that swept the platform.\r\n\r\n“Glad to meet you again,” he said in a melancholy voice. It was news to\r\nJill that they had met before. She wondered where. Her uncle supplied\r\nthe information. “Last time I saw you, you were a kiddy in short\r\nfrocks, running around and shouting to beat the band.” He looked up and\r\ndown the platform. “_I_ never heard a child make so much noise!”\r\n\r\n“I’m quite quiet now,” said Jill encouragingly. The recollection of her\r\ninfant revelry seemed to her to be distressing her relative.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, however, that it was not only this that was on his mind.\r\n\r\n“If you want to drive home,” he said, “we’ll have to phone to the\r\nDurham House for a hack.” He brooded awhile, Jill remaining silent at\r\nhis side, loath to break in upon whatever secret sorrow he was\r\nwrestling with. “That would be a dollar,” he went on. “They’re robbers\r\nin these parts! A dollar! And it’s not over a mile and a half. Are you\r\nfond of walking?”\r\n\r\nJill was a bright girl, and could take a hint.\r\n\r\n“I love walking,” she said. She might have added that she preferred to\r\ndo it on a day when the wind was not blowing quite so keenly from the\r\nEast, but her uncle’s obvious excitement at the prospect of cheating\r\nthe rapacity of the sharks at the Durham House restrained her. Her\r\nindependent soul had not quite adjusted itself to the prospect of\r\nliving on the bounty of her fellows, relatives though they were, and\r\nshe was desirous of imposing as light a burden upon them as possible.\r\n“But how about my trunk?”\r\n\r\n“The expressman will bring that up. Fifty cents!” said Uncle Elmer in a\r\ncrushed way. The high cost of entertaining seemed to be afflicting this\r\nman deeply.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Jill. She could not see how this particular expenditure\r\nwas to be avoided. Anxious as she was to make herself pleasant, she\r\ndeclined to consider carrying the trunk to their destination. “Shall we\r\nstart, then?”\r\n\r\nMr Mariner led the way out into the ice-covered road. The wind welcomed\r\nthem like a boisterous dog. For some minutes they proceeded in silence.\r\n\r\n“Your aunt will be glad to see you,” said Mr Mariner at last in the\r\nvoice with which one announces the death of a dear friend.\r\n\r\n“It’s awfully kind of you to have me to stay with you,” said Jill. It\r\nis a human tendency to think, when crises occur, in terms of melodrama,\r\nand unconsciously she had begun to regard herself somewhat in the light\r\nof a heroine driven out into the world from the old home, with no roof\r\nto shelter her head. The promptitude with which these good people, who,\r\nthough relatives, were after all complete strangers, had offered her a\r\nresting-place touched her. “I hope I shan’t be in the way.”\r\n\r\n“Major Selby was speaking to me on the telephone just now,” said Mr\r\nMariner, “and he said that you might be thinking of settling down in\r\nBrookport. I’ve some nice little places round here which you might like\r\nto look at. Rent or buy. It’s cheaper to buy. Brookport’s a growing\r\nplace. It’s getting known as a summer resort. There’s a bungalow down\r\non the shore I’d like to show you tomorrow. Stands in a nice large plot\r\nof ground, and if you bought it for twelve thousand you’d be getting a\r\nbargain.”\r\n\r\nJill was too astonished to speak. Plainly Uncle Chris had made no\r\nmention of the change in her fortunes, and this man looked on her as a\r\ngirl of wealth. She could only think how typical this was of Uncle\r\nChris. There was a sort of boyish impishness about him. She could see\r\nhim at the telephone, suave and important. He would have hung up the\r\nreceiver with a complacent smirk, thoroughly satisfied that he had done\r\nher an excellent turn.\r\n\r\n“I put all my money into real estate when I came to live here,” went on\r\nMr Mariner. “I believe in the place. It’s growing all the time.”\r\n\r\nThey had come to the outskirts of a straggling village. The lights in\r\nthe windows gave a welcome suggestion of warmth, for darkness had\r\nfallen swiftly during their walk and the chill of the wind had become\r\nmore biting. There was a smell of salt in the air now, and once or\r\ntwice Jill had caught the low booming of waves on some distant beach.\r\nThis was the Atlantic pounding the sandy shore of Fire Island.\r\nBrookport itself lay inside, on the lagoon called the Great South Bay.\r\n\r\n“This is Brookport,” said Mr Mariner. “That’s Haydock’s grocery store\r\nthere by the post-office. He charges sixty cents a pound for bacon, and\r\nI can get the same bacon by walking into Patchogue for fifty-seven!” He\r\nbrooded awhile on the greed of man, as exemplified by the pirates of\r\nBrookport. “The very same bacon!” he said.\r\n\r\n“How far is Patchogue?” asked Jill, feeling that some comment was\r\nrequired of her.\r\n\r\n“Four miles,” said Mr Mariner.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the village, bearing to the right, and found\r\nthemselves in a road bordered by large gardens in which stood big, dark\r\nhouses. The spectacle of these stimulated Mr Mariner to something\r\napproaching eloquence. He quoted the price paid for each, the price\r\nasked, the price offered, the price that had been paid five years ago.\r\nThe recital carried them on for another mile, in the course of which\r\nthe houses became smaller and more scattered, and finally, when the\r\ncountry had become bare and desolate again, they turned down a narrow\r\nlane and came to a tall, gaunt house standing by itself in a field.\r\n\r\n“This is Sandringham,” said Mr Mariner.\r\n\r\n“What!” said Jill. “What did you say?”\r\n\r\n“Sandringham. Where we live. I got the name from your father. I\r\nremember him telling me there was a place called that in England.”\r\n\r\n“There is.” Jill’s voice bubbled. “The King lives there.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?” said Mr Mariner. “Well, I bet he doesn’t have the trouble\r\nwith help that we have here. I have to pay our girl fifty dollars a\r\nmonth, and another twenty for the man who looks after the furnace and\r\nchops wood. They’re all robbers. And if you kick they quit on you!”\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nJill endured Sandringham for ten days; and, looking back on that period\r\nof her life later, she wondered how she did it. The sense of desolation\r\nwhich had gripped her on the station platform increased rather than\r\ndiminished as she grew accustomed to her surroundings. The east wind\r\ndied away, and the sun shone fitfully with a suggestion of warmth, but\r\nher uncle’s bleakness appeared to be a static quality, independent of\r\nweather conditions. Her aunt, a faded woman with a perpetual cold in\r\nthe head, did nothing to promote cheerfulness. The rest of the\r\nhousehold consisted of a gloomy child, “Tibby,” aged eight; a spaniel,\r\nprobably a few years older, and an intermittent cat, who, when he did\r\nput in an appearance, was the life and soul of the party, but whose\r\nvisits to his home were all too infrequent for Jill. Thomas was a\r\ngenial animal, whose color-scheme, like a Whistler picture, was an\r\narrangement in black and white. He had green eyes and a purr like a\r\nracing automobile. But his social engagements in the neighborhood kept\r\nhim away much of the time. He was the popular and energetic secretary\r\nof the local cats’ debating society. One could hear him at night\r\nsometimes reading the minutes in a loud, clear voice; after which the\r\ndebate was considered formally open.\r\n\r\nEach day was the same as the last, almost to the final detail.\r\nSometimes Tibby would be naughty at breakfast, sometimes at lunch;\r\nwhile Rover, the spaniel, a great devotee of the garbage-can, would\r\noccasionally be sick at mid-day instead of after the evening meal. But,\r\nwith these exceptions, there was a uniformity about the course of life\r\nin the Mariner household which began to prey on Jill’s nerves as early\r\nas the third day.\r\n\r\nThe picture which Mr Mariner had formed in his mind of Jill as a\r\nwealthy young lady with a taste for house property continued as vivid\r\nas ever. It was his practice each morning to conduct her about the\r\nneighborhood, introducing her to the various houses in which he had\r\nsunk most of the money which he had made in business. Mr Mariner’s life\r\ncentered around Brookport real estate, and the embarrassed Jill was\r\ncompelled to inspect sitting-rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, and master’s\r\nbedrooms till the sound of a key turning in a lock gave her a feeling\r\nof nervous exhaustion. Most of her uncle’s houses were converted\r\nfarmhouses and, as one unfortunate purchaser had remarked, not so\r\ndarned converted at that. The days she spent at Brookport remained in\r\nJill’s memory as a smell of dampness and chill and closeness.\r\n\r\n“You want to buy,” said Mr Mariner every time he shut a front-door\r\nbehind them. “Not rent. Buy. Then, if you don’t want to live here, you\r\ncan always rent in the summer.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible to Jill that the summer would ever come. Winter\r\nheld Brookport in its grip. For the first time in her life she was\r\ntasting real loneliness. She wandered over the snow-patched fields down\r\nto the frozen bay, and found the intense stillness, punctuated only by\r\nthe occasional distant gunshot of some optimist trying for duck,\r\noppressive rather than restful. She looked on the weird beauty of the\r\nice-bound marshes which glittered red and green and blue in the sun\r\nwith unseeing eyes; for her isolation was giving her time to think, and\r\nthought was a torment.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day came a letter from Uncle Chris,—a cheerful, even\r\nrollicking letter. Things were going well with Uncle Chris, it seemed.\r\nAs was his habit, he did not enter into details, but he wrote in a\r\nspacious way of large things to be, of affairs that were coming out\r\nright, of prosperity in sight. As tangible evidence of success, he\r\nenclosed a present of twenty dollars, for Jill to spend in the\r\nBrookport shops.\r\n\r\nThe letter arrived by the morning mail, and two hours later Mr Mariner\r\ntook Jill by one of his usual overland routes to see a house nearer the\r\nvillage than most of those which she had viewed. Mr Mariner had\r\nexhausted the supply of cottages belonging to himself, and this one was\r\nthe property of an acquaintance. There would be an agent’s fee for him\r\nin the deal, if it went through, and Mr Mariner was not a man who\r\ndespised money in small quantities.\r\n\r\nThere was a touch of hopefulness in his gloom this morning, like the\r\nfirst intimation of sunshine after a wet day. He had been thinking the\r\nthing over, and had come to the conclusion that Jill’s unresponsiveness\r\nwhen confronted with the houses she had already seen was due to the\r\nfact that she had loftier ideas than he had supposed. Something a\r\nlittle more magnificent than the twelve thousand dollar places he had\r\nshown her was what she desired. This house stood on a hill looking down\r\non the bay, in several acres of ground. It had its private\r\nlanding-stage and bath-house, its dairy, its\r\nsleeping-porches,—everything, in fact, that a sensible girl could want.\r\nMr Mariner could not bring himself to suppose that he would fail again\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n“They’re asking a hundred and five thousand,” he said, “but I know\r\nthey’d take a hundred thousand. And, if it was a question of cash down,\r\nthey would go even lower. It’s a fine house. You could entertain there.\r\nMrs Bruggenheim rented it last summer, and wanted to buy, but she\r\nwouldn’t go above ninety thousand. If you want it, you’d better make up\r\nyour mind quick. A place like this is apt to be snapped up in a hurry.”\r\n\r\nJill could endure it no longer.\r\n\r\n“But, you see,” she said gently, “all I have in the world is twenty\r\ndollars!”\r\n\r\nThere was a painful pause. Mr Mariner shot a swift glance at her in the\r\nhope of discovering that she had spoken humorously, but was compelled\r\nto decide that she had not. His face under normal conditions always\r\nachieved the maximum gloom possible for any face, so he gave no outward\r\nsign of the shock which had shattered his mental poise; but he\r\nexpressed his emotion by walking nearly a mile without saying a word.\r\nHe was stunned. He had supported himself up till now by the thought\r\nthat, frightful as the expense of entertaining Jill as a guest might\r\nbe, the outlay was a good sporting speculation if she intended buying\r\nhouse-property in the neighbourhood. The realization that he was down\r\nto the extent of a week’s breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, with\r\nnothing to show for it, appalled him. There had been a black morning\r\nsome years before when Mr. Mariner had given a waiter a ten-dollar bill\r\nin mistake for a one. As he had felt then, on discovering his error\r\nwhen it was too late to retrieve it, so did he feel now.\r\n\r\n“Twenty dollars!” he exclaimed, at the end of the mile.\r\n\r\n“Twenty dollars,” said Jill,\r\n\r\n“But your father was a rich man.” Mr. Mariner’s voice was high and\r\nplaintive. “He made a fortune over here before he went to England.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all gone. I got nipped,” said Jill, who was finding a certain\r\namount of humor in the situation, “in Amalgamated Dyes.”\r\n\r\n“Amalgamated Dyes?”\r\n\r\n“They’re something,” explained Jill, “that people get nipped in.”\r\n\r\nMr Mariner digested this.\r\n\r\n“You speculated?” he gasped.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t have been allowed to do it,” said Mr Mariner warmly.\r\n“Major Selby—your uncle ought to have known better than to allow you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, oughtn’t he,” said Jill demurely.\r\n\r\nThere was another silence, lasting for about a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s a bad business,” said Mr Mariner.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jill. “I’ve felt that myself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of this conversation was to effect a change in the\r\natmosphere of Sandringham. The alteration in the demeanor of people of\r\nparsimonious habit, when they discover that the guest they are\r\nentertaining is a pauper and not, as they had supposed, an heiress, is\r\nsubtle but well-marked. In most cases, more well-marked than subtle.\r\nNothing was actually said, but there are thoughts that are almost as\r\naudible as words. A certain suspense seemed to creep into the air, as\r\nhappens when a situation has been reached which is too poignant to\r\nlast. Greek Tragedy affects the reader with the same sense of\r\nover-hanging doom. Things, we feel, cannot go on as they are.\r\n\r\nThat night, after dinner, Mrs Mariner asked Jill to read to her.\r\n\r\n“Print tries my eyes so, dear,” said Mrs Mariner. It was a small thing,\r\nbut it had the significance of that little cloud that arose out of the\r\nsea like a man’s hand. Jill appreciated the portent. She was, she\r\nperceived, to make herself useful.\r\n\r\n“Of course I will,” she said cordially. “What would you me to read?”\r\n\r\nShe hated reading aloud. It always made her throat sore, and her eye\r\nskipped to the end of each page and took the interest out of it long\r\nbefore the proper time. But she proceeded bravely, for her conscience\r\nwas troubling her. Her sympathy was divided equally between these\r\nunfortunate people who had been saddled with an undesired visitor and\r\nherself who had been placed in a position at which every independent\r\nnerve in her rebelled. Even as a child she had loathed being under\r\nobligations to strangers or those whom she did not love.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, dear,” said Mrs Mariner, when Jill’s voice had roughened to\r\na weary croak. “You read so well.” She wrestled ineffectually with her\r\nhandkerchief against the cold in the head from which she always\r\nsuffered. “It would be nice if you would do it every night, don’t you\r\nthink? You have no idea how tired print makes my eyes.”\r\n\r\nOn the following morning after breakfast, at the hour when she had\r\nhitherto gone house-hunting with Mr Mariner, the child Tibby, of whom\r\nup till now she had seen little except at meals, presented himself to\r\nher, coated and shod for the open and regarding her with a dull and\r\nphlegmatic gaze.\r\n\r\n“Ma says will you please take me for a nice walk!”\r\n\r\nJill’s heart sank. She loved children, but Tibby was not an\r\ningratiating child. He was a Mr Mariner in little. He had the family\r\ngloom. It puzzled Jill sometimes why this branch of the family should\r\nlook on life with so jaundiced an eye. She remembered her father as a\r\ncheerful man, alive to the small humors of life.\r\n\r\n“All right, Tibby. Where shall we go?”\r\n\r\n“Ma says we must keep on the roads and I mustn’t slide.”\r\n\r\nJill was thoughtful during the walk. Tibby, who was no\r\nconversationalist, gave her every opportunity for meditation. She\r\nperceived that in the space of a few hours she had sunk in the social\r\nscale. If there was any difference between her position and that of a\r\npaid nurse and companion, it lay in the fact that she was not paid. She\r\nlooked about her at the grim countryside, gave a thought to the chill\r\ngloom of the house to which she was about to return, and her heart\r\nsank.\r\n\r\nNearing home, Tibby vouchsafed his first independent observation.\r\n\r\n“The hired man’s quit!”\r\n\r\n“Has he?”\r\n\r\n“Yep. Quit this morning.”\r\n\r\nIt had begun to snow. They turned and made their way back to the house.\r\nThe information she had received did not cause Jill any great\r\napprehension. It was hardly likely that her new duties would include\r\nthe stoking of the furnace. That and cooking appeared to be the only\r\nacts about the house which were outside her present sphere of\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\n“He killed a rat once in the wood-shed with an axe,” said Tibby\r\nchattily. “Yessir! Chopped it right in half, and it bled!”\r\n\r\n“Look at the pretty snow falling on the trees,” said Jill faintly.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast next morning, Mrs Mariner having sneezed, made a\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n“Tibby, darling, wouldn’t it be nice if you and cousin Jill played a\r\ngame of pretending you were pioneers in the Far West?”\r\n\r\n“What’s a pioneer?” enquired Tibby, pausing in the middle of an act of\r\nviolence on a plate of oatmeal.\r\n\r\n“The pioneers were the early settlers in this country, dear. You have\r\nread about them in your history book. They endured a great many\r\nhardships, for life was very rough for them, with no railroads or\r\nanything. I think it would be a nice game to play this morning.”\r\n\r\nTibby looked at Jill. There was doubt in his eye. Jill returned his\r\ngaze sympathetically. One thought was in both their minds.\r\n\r\n“There is a string to this!” said Tibby’s eye.\r\n\r\n“Exactly what I think!” said Jill’s.\r\n\r\nMrs Mariner sneezed again.\r\n\r\n“You would have lots of fun,” she said.\r\n\r\n“What’ud we do?” asked Tibby cautiously. He had been this way before.\r\nOnly last Summer, on his mother’s suggestion that he should pretend he\r\nwas a ship-wrecked sailor on a desert island, he had perspired through\r\na whole afternoon cutting the grass in front of the house to make a\r\nship-wrecked sailor’s simple bed.\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Jill. “We’ll pretend we’re pioneers stormbound in their\r\nlog cabin in the woods, and the wolves are howling outside, and they\r\ndaren’t go out, so they make a lovely big fire and sit in front of it\r\nand read.”\r\n\r\n“And eat candy,” suggested Tibby, warming to the idea.\r\n\r\n“And eat candy,” agreed Jill.\r\n\r\nMrs Mariner frowned.\r\n\r\n“I was going to suggest,” she said frostily, “that you shovelled the\r\nsnow away from the front steps!”\r\n\r\n“Splendid!” said Jill. “Oh, but I forgot. I want to go to the village\r\nfirst.”\r\n\r\n“There will be plenty of time to do it when you get back.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I’ll do it when I get back.”\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter of an hour’s walk to the village. Jill stopped at the\r\npost-office.\r\n\r\n“Could you tell me,” she asked, “when the next train is to New York?”\r\n\r\n“There’s one at ten-ten,” said the woman, behind the window. “You’ll\r\nhave to hurry.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll hurry!” said Jill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nDoctors, laying down the law in their usual confident way, tell us that\r\nthe vitality of the human body is at its lowest at two o’clock in the\r\nmorning: and that it is then, as a consequence, that the mind is least\r\nable to contemplate the present with equanimity, the future with\r\nfortitude, and the past without regret. Every thinking man, however,\r\nknows that this is not so. The true zero hour, desolate, gloom-ridden,\r\nand specter-haunted, occurs immediately before dinner while we are\r\nwaiting for that cocktail. It is then that, stripped for a brief moment\r\nof our armor of complacency and self-esteem, we see ourselves as we\r\nare,—frightful chumps in a world where nothing goes right; a gray world\r\nin which, hoping to click, we merely get the raspberry; where, animated\r\nby the best intentions, we nevertheless succeed in perpetrating the\r\nscaliest bloomers and landing our loved ones neck-deep in the gumbo.\r\n\r\nSo reflected Freddie Rooke, that priceless old bean, sitting\r\ndisconsolately in an arm-chair at the Drones Club about two weeks after\r\nJill’s departure from England, waiting for his friend Algy Martyn to\r\ntrickle in and give him dinner.\r\n\r\nSurveying Freddie, as he droops on his spine in the yielding leather,\r\none is conscious of one’s limitations as a writer. Gloom like his calls\r\nfor the pen of a master. Zola could have tackled it nicely. Gorky might\r\nhave made a stab at it. Dostoievsky would have handled it with relish.\r\nBut for oneself the thing is too vast. One cannot wangle it. It\r\nintimidates. It would have been bad enough in any case, for Algy Martyn\r\nwas late as usual and it always gave Freddie the pip to have to wait\r\nfor dinner: but what made it worse was the fact that the Drones was not\r\none of Freddie’s clubs and so, until the blighter Algy arrived, it was\r\nimpossible for him to get his cocktail. There he sat, surrounded by\r\nhappy, laughing young men, each grasping a glass of the good old\r\nmixture-as-before, absolutely unable to connect. Some of them, casual\r\nacquaintances, had nodded to him, waved, and gone on lowering the\r\njuice,—a spectacle which made Freddie feel much as the wounded soldier\r\nwould have felt if Sir Philip Sidney, instead of offering him the cup\r\nof water, had placed it to his own lips and drained it with a careless\r\n“Cheerio!” No wonder Freddie experienced the sort of abysmal\r\nsoul-sadness which afflicts one of Tolstoi’s Russian peasants when,\r\nafter putting in a heavy day’s work strangling his father, beating his\r\nwife, and dropping the baby into the city reservoir, he turns to the\r\ncupboard, only to find the vodka-bottle empty.\r\n\r\nFreddie gave himself up to despondency: and, as always in these days\r\nwhen he was mournful, he thought of Jill. Jill’s sad case was a\r\ncontinual source of mental anguish to him. From the first he had blamed\r\nhimself for the breaking-off of her engagement with Derek. If he had\r\nnot sent the message to Derek from the police-station, the latter would\r\nnever have known about their arrest, and all would have been well. And\r\nnow, a few days ago, had come the news of her financial disaster, with\r\nits attendant complications.\r\n\r\nIt had descended on Freddie like a thunderbolt through the medium of\r\nRonny Devereux.\r\n\r\n“I say,” Ronny had said, “have you heard the latest? Your pal,\r\nUnderhill, has broken off his engagement with Jill Mariner.”\r\n\r\n“I know; rather rotten, what!”\r\n\r\n“Rotten? I should say so! It isn’t done. I mean to say, chap can’t\r\nchuck a girl just because she’s lost her money. Simply isn’t on the\r\nboard, old man!”\r\n\r\n“Lost her money? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nRonny was surprised. Hadn’t Freddie heard? Yes, absolute fact. He had\r\nit from the best authority. Didn’t know how it had happened and all\r\nthat, but Jill Mariner had gone completely bust; Underhill had given\r\nher the miss-in-baulk; and the poor girl had legged it, no one knew\r\nwhere. Oh, Freddie had met her and she had told him she was going to\r\nAmerica? Well, then, legged it to America. But the point was that the\r\nswine Underhill had handed her the mitten just because she was broke,\r\nand that was what Ronny thought so bally rotten. Broker a girl is,\r\nRonny meant to say, more a fellow should stick to her.\r\n\r\n“But—” Freddie rushed to his hero’s defence. “But it wasn’t that at\r\nall. Something quite different. I mean, Derek didn’t even know Jill had\r\nlost her money. He broke the engagement because …” Freddie stopped\r\nshort. He didn’t want everybody to know of that rotten arrest business,\r\nas they infallibly would if he confided in Ronny Devereux. Sort of\r\nthing he would never hear the last of. “He broke it off because of\r\nsomething quite different.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!” said Ronny skeptically.\r\n\r\n“But he did, really!”\r\n\r\nRonny shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you believe it, old son. Don’t you believe it. Stands to reason\r\nit must have been because the poor girl was broke. You wouldn’t have\r\ndone it and I wouldn’t have done it, but Underhill did, and that’s all\r\nthere is to it. I mean, a tick’s a tick, and there’s nothing more to\r\nsay. Well, I know he’s been a pal of yours, Freddie, but, next time I\r\nmeet him, by Jove, I’ll cut him dead. Only I don’t know him to speak\r\nto, dash it!” concluded Ronny regretfully.\r\n\r\nRonny’s news had upset Freddie. Derek had returned to the Albany a\r\ncouple of days ago, moody and silent. They had lunched together at the\r\nBachelors, and Freddie had been pained at the attitude of his fellow\r\nclubmen. Usually, when he lunched at the Bachelors, his table became a\r\nsort of social center. Cheery birds would roll up to pass the time of\r\nday, and festive old eggs would toddle over to have coffee and so\r\nforth, and all that sort of thing. Jolly! On this occasion nobody had\r\nrolled, and all the eggs present had taken their coffee elsewhere.\r\nThere was an uncomfortable chill in the atmosphere of which Freddie had\r\nbeen acutely conscious, though Derek had not appeared to notice it. The\r\nthing had only come home to Derek yesterday at the Albany, when the\r\npainful episode of Wally Mason had occurred. It was this way:\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Freddie, old top! Sorry to have kept you waiting.”\r\n\r\nFreddie looked up from his broken meditations, to find that his host\r\nhad arrived.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!”\r\n\r\n“A quick bracer,” said Algy Martyn, “and then the jolly old\r\nfood-stuffs. It’s pretty late, I see. Didn’t notice how time was\r\nslipping.”\r\n\r\nOver the soup, Freddie was still a prey to gloom. For once the healing\r\ngin-and-vermouth had failed to do its noble work. He sipped sombrely,\r\nso sombrely as to cause comment from his host.\r\n\r\n“Pipped?” enquired Algy solicitously.\r\n\r\n“Pretty pipped,” admitted Freddie.\r\n\r\n“Backed a loser?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Something wrong with the old tum?”\r\n\r\n“No. … Worried.”\r\n\r\n“Worried?”\r\n\r\n“About Derek.”\r\n\r\n“Derek? Who’s … ? Oh, you mean Underhill?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nAlgy Martyn chased an elusive piece of carrot about his soup plate,\r\nwatching it interestedly as it slid coyly from the spoon.\r\n\r\n“Oh?” he said, with sudden coolness. “What about him?”\r\n\r\nFreddie was too absorbed in his subject to notice the change in his\r\nfriend’s tone.\r\n\r\n“A dashed unpleasant thing,” he said, “happened yesterday morning at my\r\nplace. I was just thinking about going out to lunch, when the door-bell\r\nrang and Parker said a chappie of the name of Mason would like to see\r\nme. I didn’t remember any Mason, but Parker said the chappie said he\r\nknew me when I was a kid. So he loosed him into the room, and it turned\r\nout to be a fellow I used to know years ago down in Worcestershire. I\r\ndidn’t know him from Adam at first, but gradually the old bean got to\r\nwork, and I placed him. Wally Mason his name was. Rummily enough, he\r\nhad spoken to me at the Leicester that night when the fire was, but not\r\nbeing able to place him, I had given him the miss somewhat. You know\r\nhow it is. Chappie you’ve never been introduced to says something to\r\nyou in a theatre, and you murmur something and sheer off. What?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely,” agreed Algy Martyn. He thoroughly approved of Freddie’s\r\ncode of etiquette. Sheer off. Only thing to do.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow, now that he had turned up again and told me who he was,\r\nI began to remember. We had been kids together, don’t you know. (What’s\r\nthis? Salmon? Oh, right ho.) So I buzzed about and did the jovial host,\r\nyou know; gave him a drink and a toofer, and all that sort of thing;\r\nand talked about the dear old days and what not. And so forth, if you\r\nfollow me. Then he brought the conversation round to Jill. Of course he\r\nknew Jill at the same time when he knew me, down in Worcestershire, you\r\nsee. We were all pretty pally in those days, if you see what I mean.\r\nWell, this man Mason, it seems, had heard somewhere about Jill losing\r\nher money, and he wanted to know if it was true. I said absolutely.\r\nHadn’t heard any details, but Ronny had told me and Ronny had had it\r\nfrom some one who had stable information and all that sort of thing.\r\n‘Dashed shame, isn’t it!’ I said. ‘She’s gone to America, you know.’ ‘I\r\ndidn’t know,’ he said. ‘I understood she was going to be married quite\r\nsoon.’ Well, of course, I told him that that was off. He didn’t say\r\nanything for a bit, then he said ‘Off?’ I said ‘Off.’ ‘Did she break it\r\noff?’ asked the chappie. ‘Well, no,’ I said. ‘As a matter of fact Derek\r\nbroke it off.’ He said ‘Oh!’ (What? Oh yes, a bit of pheasant will be\r\nfine.) Where was I? Oh, yes. He said ‘Oh!’ Now, before this, I ought to\r\ntell you, this chappie Mason had asked me to come out and have a bit of\r\nlunch. I had told him I was lunching with Derek, and he said ‘Right\r\nho,’ or words to that effect, ‘Bring him along.’ Derek had been out for\r\na stroll, you see, and we were waiting for him to come in. Well, just\r\nat this point or juncture, if you know what I mean, in he came, and I\r\nsaid ‘Oh, what ho!’ and introduced Wally Mason. ‘Oh, do you know\r\nUnderhill?’ I said, or something like that. You know the sort of thing.\r\nAnd then …”\r\n\r\nFreddie broke off and drained his glass. The recollection of that\r\npainful moment had made him feverish. Social difficulties always did.\r\n\r\n“Then what?” enquired Algy Martyn.\r\n\r\n“Well, it, was pretty rotten. Derek held out his hand, as a chappie\r\nnaturally would, being introduced to a strange chappie, and Wally\r\nMason, giving it an absolute miss, went on talking to me just as if we\r\nwere alone, you know. Look here. Here was I, where this knife is. Derek\r\nover here—this fork—with his hand out. Mason here—this bit of bread.\r\nMason looks at his watch, and says ‘I’m sorry, Freddie, but I find I’ve\r\nan engagement for lunch. So long!’ and biffed out, without apparently\r\nknowing Derek was on the earth. I mean …” Freddie reached for his\r\nglass, “What I mean is, it was dashed embarrassing. I mean, cutting a\r\nfellow dead in my rooms. I don’t know when I’ve felt so rotten!”\r\n\r\nAlgy Martyn delivered judgment with great firmness.\r\n\r\n“Chappie was perfectly right!”\r\n\r\n“No, but I mean …”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely correct-o,” insisted Algy sternly. “Underhill can’t dash\r\nabout all over the place giving the girl he’s engaged to the mitten\r\nbecause she’s broke, and expect no notice to be taken of it. If you\r\nwant to know what I think, old man, your pal Underhill—I can’t imagine\r\nwhat the deuce you see in him, but, school together and so forth, makes\r\na difference, I suppose,—I say, if you want to know what I think,\r\nFreddie, the blighter Underhill would be well advised either to leg it\r\nafter Jill and get her to marry him or else lie low for a goodish while\r\ntill people have forgotten the thing. I mean to say, fellows like Ronny\r\nand I and Dick Wimpole and Archie Studd and the rest of our lot,—well,\r\nwe all knew Jill and thought she was a topper and had danced with her\r\nhere and there and seen her about and all that, and naturally we feel\r\npretty strongly about the whole dashed business. Underhill isn’t in our\r\nparticular set, but we all know most of the people he knows, and we\r\ntalk about this business, and the thing gets about, and there you are!\r\nMy sister, who was a great pal of Jill’s, swears that all the girls she\r\nknows mean to cut Underhill. I tell you, Freddie, London’s going to get\r\npretty hot for him if he doesn’t do something dashed quick and with\r\ngreat rapidity!”\r\n\r\n“But you haven’t got the story right, old thing!”\r\n\r\n“How not?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean you think and Ronny thinks and all the rest of you think\r\nthat Derek broke off the engagement because of the money. It wasn’t\r\nthat at all.”\r\n\r\n“What was it, then?”\r\n\r\n“Well … Well, look here, it makes me seem a fearful ass and all that,\r\nbut I’d better tell you. Jill and I were going down one of those\r\nstreets near Victoria and a blighter was trying to slay a parrot …”\r\n\r\n“Parrot-shooting’s pretty good in those parts, they tell me,”\r\ninterjected Algy satirically.\r\n\r\n“Don’t interrupt, old man. This parrot had got out of one of the\r\nhouses, and a fellow was jabbing at it with a stick, and Jill—you know\r\nwhat she’s like; impulsive, I mean, and all that—Jill got hold of the\r\nstick and biffed him with some vim, and a policeman rolled up and the\r\nfellow made a fuss and the policeman took Jill and me off to chokey.\r\nWell, like an ass, I sent round to Derek to bail us out, and that’s how\r\nhe heard of the thing. Apparently he didn’t think a lot of it, and the\r\nresult was that he broke off the engagement.”\r\n\r\nAlgy Martin had listened to this recital with growing amazement.\r\n\r\n“He broke it off because of that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What absolute rot!” said Algy Martyn. “I don’t believe a word of it!”\r\n\r\n“I say, old man!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe a word of it,” repeated Algy firmly. “And nobody else\r\nwill either. It’s dashed good of you, Freddie, to cook up a yarn like\r\nthat to try and make things look better for the blighter, but it won’t\r\nwork. Such a damn silly story, too!” said Algy with some indignation.\r\n\r\n“But it’s true!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the use, Freddie, between old pals?” said Algy protestingly.\r\n“You know perfectly well that Underhill’s a cootie of the most\r\npronounced order, and that, when he found out that Jill hadn’t any\r\nmoney, he chucked her.”\r\n\r\n“But why should Derek care whether Jill was well off or not? He’s got\r\nenough money of his own.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody,” said Algy judicially, “has got enough money of his own.\r\nUnderhill thought he was marrying a girl with a sizeable chunk of the\r\nready, and, when the fuse blew out, he decided it wasn’t good enough.\r\nFor Heaven’s sake don’t let’s talk any more about the blighter. It\r\ngives me a pain to think of him.”\r\n\r\nAnd Algy Martyn, suppressing every effort which Freddie made to reopen\r\nthe subject, turned the conversation to more general matters.\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nFreddie returned to the Albany in a state of gloom and uneasiness.\r\nAlgy’s remarks, coming on top of the Wally Mason episode, had shaken\r\nhim. The London in which he and Derek moved and had their being is\r\nnothing but a village, and it was evident that village gossip was\r\nhostile to Derek. People were talking about him. Local opinion had\r\ndecided that he had behaved badly. Already one man had cut him. Freddie\r\nblenched at a sudden vision of street-fulls of men, long Piccadillys of\r\nmen, all cutting him, one after the other. Something had got to be\r\ndone. He was devoted to Derek. This sort of thing was as bad as being\r\ncut himself. Whatever Freddie’s limitations in the matter of brain, he\r\nhad a large heart and an infinite capacity for faithfulness in his\r\nfriendships.\r\n\r\nThe subject was not an easy one to broach to his somewhat forbidding\r\nfriend, as he discovered when the latter arrived about half an hour\r\nlater. Derek had been attending the semi-annual banquet of the\r\nWorshipful Dry-Salters Company down in the City, understudying one of\r\nthe speakers, a leading member of Parliament, who had been unable to\r\nappear; and he was still in the grip of that feeling of degraded\r\nrepletion which city dinners induce. The dry-salters, on these\r\noccasions when they cast off for a night the cares and anxieties of\r\ndry-salting, do their guests well, and Derek had that bloated sense of\r\nforeboding which comes to a man whose stomach is not his strong point\r\nafter twelve courses and a multitude of mixed wines. A goose,\r\nqualifying for the role of a pot of pate de foies gras, probably has\r\nexactly the same jaundiced outlook.\r\n\r\nYet, unfavorably disposed as, judging by his silence and the occasional\r\nmoody grunts he uttered, he appeared to be to a discussion of his\r\nprivate affairs, it seemed to Freddie impossible that the night should\r\nbe allowed to pass without some word spoken on the subject. He thought\r\nof Ronny and what Ronny had said, of Algy and what Algy had said, of\r\nWally Mason and how Wally had behaved in this very room; and he nerved\r\nhimself to the task.\r\n\r\n“Derek, old top.”\r\n\r\nA grunt.\r\n\r\n“I say, Derek, old bean.”\r\n\r\nDerek roused himself, and looked gloomily across the room to where he\r\nstood, warming his legs at the blaze.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\nFreddie found a difficulty in selecting words. A ticklish business,\r\nthis. One that might well have disconcerted a diplomat. Freddie was no\r\ndiplomat, and the fact enabled him to find a way in the present crisis.\r\nEquipped by nature with an amiable tactlessness and a happy gift of\r\nblundering, he charged straight at the main point, and landed on it\r\nlike a circus elephant alighting on a bottle.\r\n\r\n“I say, you know, about Jill!”\r\n\r\nHe stooped to rub the backs of his legs, on which the fire was playing\r\nwith a little too fierce a glow, and missed his companion’s start and\r\nthe sudden thickening of his bushy eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Derek again.\r\n\r\nFreddie nerved himself to proceed. A thought flashed across his mind\r\nthat Derek was looking exactly like Lady Underhill. It was the first\r\ntime he had seen the family resemblance quite so marked.\r\n\r\n“Ronny Devereux was saying …” faltered Freddie.\r\n\r\n“Damn Ronny Devereux!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, absolutely! But …”\r\n\r\n“Ronny Devereux! Who the devil _is_ Ronny Devereux?”\r\n\r\n“Why, old man, you’ve heard me speak of him, haven’t you? Pal of mine.\r\nHe came down to the station with Algy and me to meet your mater that\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _that_ fellow? And he has been saying something about … ?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t only Ronny, you know,” Freddie hastened to interject. “Algy\r\nMartyn’s talking about it, too. And lots of other fellows. And Algy’s\r\nsister and a lot of people. They’re all saying …”\r\n\r\n“What are they saying?”\r\n\r\nFreddie bent down and chafed the back of his legs. He simply couldn’t\r\nlook at Derek while he had that Lady Underhill expression on the old\r\nmap. Rummy he had never noticed before how extraordinarily like his\r\nmother he was. Freddie was conscious of a faint sense of grievance. He\r\ncould not have put it into words, but what he felt was that a fellow\r\nhad no right to go about looking like Lady Underhill.\r\n\r\n“What are they saying?” repeated Derek grimly.\r\n\r\n“Well …” Freddie hesitated. “That it’s a bit tough … On Jill, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“They think I behaved badly?”\r\n\r\n“Well … Oh, well, you know!”\r\n\r\nDerek smiled a ghastly smile. This was not wholly due to mental\r\ndisturbance. The dull heaviness which was the legacy of the\r\nDry-Salters’ dinner had begun to change to something more actively\r\nunpleasant. A sub-motive of sharp pain had begun to run through it,\r\nflashing in and out like lightning through a thunder-cloud. He felt\r\nsullen and vicious.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” he said with savage politeness, “if, when you chat with\r\nyour friends, you would mind choosing some other topic than my private\r\naffairs.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry, old man. But they started it, don’t you know.”\r\n\r\n“And, if you feel you’ve got to discuss me, kindly keep it to yourself.\r\nDon’t come and tell me what your damned friends said to each other and\r\nto you and what you said to them, because it bores me. I’m not\r\ninterested. I don’t value their opinions as much as you seem to.” Derek\r\npaused, to battle in silence with the imperious agony within him. “It\r\nwas good of you to put me up here,” he went on, “but I think I won’t\r\ntrespass on your hospitality any longer. Perhaps you’ll ask Parker to\r\npack my things tomorrow.” Derek moved, as majestically as an ex-guest\r\nof the Worshipful Company of Dry-Salters may, in the direction of the\r\ndoor. “I shall go to the Savoy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say, old man! No need to do that.”\r\n\r\n“Good night.”\r\n\r\n“But, I say …”\r\n\r\n“And you can tell your friend Devereux that, if he doesn’t stop poking\r\nhis nose into my private business, I’ll pull it off.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Freddie doubtfully, “of course I don’t suppose you know,\r\nbut … Ronny’s a pretty hefty bird. He boxed for Cambridge in the\r\nlight-weights the last year he was up, you know. He …”\r\n\r\nDerek slammed the door. Freddie was alone. He stood rubbing his legs\r\nfor some minutes, a rueful expression on his usually cheerful face.\r\nFreddie hated rows. He liked everything to jog along smoothly. What a\r\nrotten place the world was these days! Just one thing after another.\r\nFirst, poor old Jill takes the knock and disappears. He would miss her\r\nbadly. What a good sort! What a pal! And now—gone. Biffed off. Next,\r\nDerek. Together, more or less, ever since Winchester, and now—bing!…\r\n\r\nFreddie heaved a sigh, and reached out for the _Sporting Times_, his\r\nnever-failing comfort in times of depression. He lit another cigar and\r\ncurled up in one of the arm-chairs. He was feeling tired. He had been\r\nplaying squash all the afternoon, a game at which he was exceedingly\r\nexpert and to which he was much addicted.\r\n\r\nTime passed. The paper slipped to the floor. A cold cigar followed it.\r\nFrom the depths of the chair came a faint snore …\r\n\r\n\r\nA hand on his shoulder brought Freddie with a jerk troubled dreams.\r\nDerek was standing beside him. A tousled Derek, apparently in pain.\r\n\r\n“Freddie!”\r\n\r\n“Hullo!”\r\n\r\nA spasm twisted Derek’s face.\r\n\r\n“Have you got any pepsin?”\r\n\r\nDerek uttered a groan. What a mocker of our petty human dignity is this\r\ndyspepsia, bringing low the haughtiest of us, less than love itself a\r\nrespecter of persons. This was a different Derek from the man who had\r\nstalked stiffly from the room two hours before. His pride had been\r\nhumbled upon the rack.\r\n\r\n“Pepsin?”\r\n\r\nFreddie blinked, the mists of sleep floating gently before his eyes. He\r\ncould not quite understand what his friend was asking for. It had\r\nsounded just like pepsin, and he didn’t believe there was such a word.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’ve got the most damned attack of indigestion.”\r\n\r\nThe mists of sleep rolled away from Freddie. He was awake again, and\r\nbecame immediately helpful. These were the occasions when the Last of\r\nthe Rookes was a good man to have at your side. It was Freddie who\r\nsuggested that Derek should recline in the arm-chair which he had\r\nvacated; Freddie who nipped round the corner to the all-night chemist’s\r\nand returned with a magic bottle guaranteed to relieve an ostrich after\r\na surfeit of soda-water bottles; Freddie who mixed and administered the\r\ndose.\r\n\r\nHis ministrations were rewarded. Presently the agony seemed to pass.\r\nDerek recovered.\r\n\r\nOne would say that Derek became himself again, but that the mood of\r\ngentle remorse which came upon him as he lay in the arm-chair was one\r\nso foreign to his nature. Freddie had never seen him so subdued. He was\r\nlike a convalescent child. Between them, the all-night chemist and the\r\nDry-Salters seemed to have wrought a sort of miracle. These temporary\r\nsoftenings of personality frequently follow city dinners. The time to\r\ncatch your Dry-Salter in angelic mood is the day after the semi-annual\r\nbanquet. Go to him then and he will give you his watch and chain.\r\n\r\n“Freddie,” said Derek.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting over the dying fire. The clock on the mantelpiece,\r\nbeside which Jill’s photograph had stood, pointed to ten minutes past\r\ntwo. Derek spoke in a low, soft voice. Perhaps the doctors are right\r\nafter all, and two o’clock is the hour at which our self-esteem deserts\r\nus, leaving in its place regret for past sins, good resolutions for\r\nfuture behavior.\r\n\r\n“What do Algy Martyn and the others say about … you know?”\r\n\r\nFreddie hesitated. Pity to start all that again.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know,” went on Derek. “They say I behaved like a cad.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well …”\r\n\r\n“They are quite right. I did.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I shouldn’t say that, you know. Faults on both sides and all that\r\nsort of rot.”\r\n\r\n“I did!” Derek stared into the fire. Scattered all over London at that\r\nmoment, probably, a hundred worshipful Dry-Salters were equally\r\nsleepless and subdued, looking wide-eyed into black pasts. “Is it true\r\nshe has gone to America, Freddie?”\r\n\r\n“She told me she was going.”\r\n\r\n“What a fool I’ve been!”\r\n\r\nThe clock ticked on through the silence. The fire sputtered faintly,\r\nthen gave a little wheeze, like a very old man. Derek rested his chin\r\non his hands, gazing into the ashes.\r\n\r\n“I wish to God I could go over there and find her.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“How can I? There may be an election coming on at any moment. I can’t\r\nstir.”\r\n\r\nFreddie leaped from his seat. The suddenness of the action sent a\r\nred-hot corkscrew of pain through Derek’s head.\r\n\r\n“What the devil’s the matter?” he demanded irritably. Even the gentle\r\nmood which comes with convalescence after a City Dinner is not\r\nguaranteed to endure against this sort of thing.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got an idea, old bean!”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s no need to dance, is there?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve nothing to keep me here, you know. What’s the matter with my\r\npopping over to America and finding Jill?” Freddie tramped the floor,\r\naglow. Each beat of his foot jarred Derek, but he made no complaint.\r\n\r\n“Could you?” he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Of course I could. I was saying only the other day that I had half a\r\nmind to buzz over. It’s a wheeze! I’ll get on the next boat and charge\r\nover in the capacity of a jolly old ambassador. Have her back in no\r\ntime. Leave it to me, old thing! This is where I come out strong!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nNew York welcomed Jill, as she came out of the Pennsylvania Station\r\ninto Seventh Avenue, with a whirl of powdered snow that touched her\r\ncheek like a kiss, the cold, bracing kiss one would expect from this\r\nvivid city. She stood at the station entrance, a tiny figure beside the\r\nhuge pillars, looking round her with eager eyes. A wind was whipping\r\ndown the avenue. The sky was a clear, brilliant tent of the brightest\r\nblue. Energy was in the air, and hopefulness. She wondered if Mr Elmer\r\nMariner ever came to New York. It was hard to see how even his gloom\r\nwould contrive to remain unaffected by the exhilaration of the place.\r\n\r\nYes, New York looked good … good and exciting, with all the taxi-cabs\r\nrattling in at the dark tunnel beside her, with all the people hurrying\r\nin and hurrying out, with all this medley of street-cars and sky-signs\r\nand crushed snow and drays and horses and policemen, and that vast\r\nhotel across the street, towering to heaven like a cliff. It even smelt\r\ngood. She remembered an old picture in _Punch_, of two country visitors\r\nstanding on the step of their railway carriage at a London terminus,\r\none saying ecstatically to other: “Don’t speak! Just sniff! Doesn’t it\r\nsmell of the Season!” She knew exactly how they had felt, and she\r\napproved of their attitude. That was the right way to behave on being\r\nintroduced to a great metropolis. She stood and sniffed reverently. But\r\nfor the presence of the hurrying crowds, she could almost have imitated\r\nthe example of that king who kissed the soil of his country on landing\r\nfrom his ship.\r\n\r\nShe took Uncle Chris’ letter from her bag. He had written from an\r\naddress on East Fifty-seventh Street. There would be just time to catch\r\nhim before he went out to lunch. She hailed a taxi-cab which was coming\r\nout of the station.\r\n\r\nIt was a slow ride, halted repeatedly by congestion of the traffic, but\r\na short one for Jill. She was surprised at herself, a Londoner of long\r\nstanding, for feeling so provincial and being so impressed. But London\r\nwas far away. It belonged to a life that seemed years ago and a world\r\nfrom which she had parted for ever. Moreover, this was undeniably a\r\nstupendous city through which her taxi-cab was carrying her. At Times\r\nSquare the stream of the traffic plunged into a whirlpool, swinging out\r\nof Broadway to meet the rapids which poured in from east, west, and\r\nnorth. On Fifth Avenue all the automobiles in the world were gathered\r\ntogether. On the sidewalks, pedestrians, muffled against the nipping\r\nchill of the crisp air, hurried to and fro. And, above, that sapphire\r\nsky spread a rich velvet curtain which made the tops of the buildings\r\nstand out like the white minarets of some eastern city of romance.\r\n\r\nThe cab drew up in front of a stone apartment house; and Jill, getting\r\nout, passed under an awning through a sort of mediaeval courtyard, gay\r\nwith potted shrubs, to an inner door. She was impressed. The very\r\natmosphere was redolent of riches, and she wondered how in the world\r\nUncle Chris had managed to acquire wealth on this scale in the\r\nextremely short space of time which had elapsed since his landing.\r\nThere bustled past her an obvious millionaire—or, more probably, a\r\ngreater monarch of finance who looked down upon mere millionaires and\r\nout of the goodness of his heart tried to check a tendency to speak\r\npatronisingly to them. He was concealed to the eyebrows in a fur coat,\r\nand, reaching the sidewalk, was instantly absorbed in a large\r\nlimousine. Two expensive-looking ladies followed him. Jill began to\r\nfeel a little dazed. Evidently the tales one heard of fortunes\r\naccumulated overnight in this magic city were true, and one of them\r\nmust have fallen to the lot of Uncle Chris. For nobody to whom money\r\nwas a concern could possibly afford to live in a place like this. If\r\nCrœsus and the Count of Monte Cristo had applied for lodging there, the\r\nauthorities would probably have looked on them a little doubtfully at\r\nfirst and hinted at the desirability of a month’s rent in advance.\r\n\r\nIn a glass case behind the inner door, reading a newspaper and chewing\r\ngum, sat a dignified old man in the rich uniform of a general in the\r\nGuatemalan army. He was a brilliant spectacle. He wore no jewelry, but\r\nthis, no doubt, was due to a private distaste for display. As there was\r\nno one else of humbler rank at hand from whom Jill could solicit an\r\nintroduction and the privilege of an audience, she took the bold step\r\nof addressing him directly.\r\n\r\n“I want to see Major Selby, please.”\r\n\r\nThe Guatemalan general arrested for a moment the rhythmic action of his\r\njaws, lowered his paper and looked at her with raised eyebrows. At\r\nfirst Jill thought that he was registering haughty contempt, then she\r\nsaw what she had taken for scorn was surprise.\r\n\r\n“Major Selby?”\r\n\r\n“Major Selby.”\r\n\r\n“No Major Selby living here.”\r\n\r\n“Major Christopher Selby.”\r\n\r\n“Not here,” said the associate of ambassadors and the pampered pet of\r\nGuatemala’s proudest beauties. “Never heard of him in my life!”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nJill had read works of fiction in which at certain crises everything\r\nhad “seemed to swim” in front of the heroine’s eyes, but never till\r\nthis moment had she experienced that remarkable sensation herself. The\r\nSavior of Guatemala did not actually swim, perhaps, but he certainly\r\nflickered. She had to blink to restore his prismatic outlines to their\r\nproper sharpness. Already the bustle and noise of New York had begun to\r\ninduce in her that dizzy condition of unreality which one feels in\r\ndreams, and this extraordinary statement added the finishing touch.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fact that she had said “please” to him when she opened the\r\nconversation touched the heart of the hero of a thousand revolutions.\r\nDignified and beautiful as he was to the eye of the stranger, it is\r\nunpleasant to have to record that he lived in a world which rather\r\nneglected the minor courtesies of speech. People did not often say\r\n“please” to him. “Here!” “Hi!” and “Gosh darn you!” yes; but seldom\r\n“please.” He seemed to approve of Jill, for he shifted his chewing-gum\r\nto a position which facilitated speech, and began to be helpful.\r\n\r\n“What was the name again?”\r\n\r\n“Selby.”\r\n\r\n“Howja spell it?”\r\n\r\n“S-e-l-b-y.”\r\n\r\n“S-e-l-b-y. Oh, Selby?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Selby.”\r\n\r\n“What was the first name?”\r\n\r\n“Christopher.”\r\n\r\n“Christopher?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Christopher.”\r\n\r\n“Christopher Selby? No one of that name living here.”\r\n\r\n“But there must be.”\r\n\r\nThe veteran shook his head with an indulgent smile.\r\n\r\n“You want Mr Sipperley,” he said tolerantly. In Guatemala these\r\nmistakes are always happening. “Mr George Sipperley. He’s on the fourth\r\nfloor. What name shall I say?”\r\n\r\nHe had almost reached the telephone when Jill stopped him. This is an\r\nage of just-as-good substitutes, but she refused to accept any unknown\r\nSipperley as a satisfactory alternative for Uncle Chris.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want Mr Sipperley. I want Major Selby.”\r\n\r\n“Howja spell it once more?”\r\n\r\n“S-e-l-b-y.”\r\n\r\n“S-e-l-b-y. No one of that name living here. Mr. Sipperley—”—he spoke\r\nin a wheedling voice, as if determined, in spite of herself, to make\r\nJill see what was in her best interests—“Mr Sipperley’s on the fourth\r\nfloor. Gentleman in the real estate business,” he added insinuatingly.\r\n“He’s got blond hair and a Boston bull-dog.”\r\n\r\n“He may be all you say, and he may have a dozen bulldogs …”\r\n\r\n“Only one. Jack his name is.”\r\n\r\n“… But he isn’t the right man. It’s absurd. Major Selby wrote to me\r\nfrom this address. This _is_ Eighteen East Fifty-seventh Street?”\r\n\r\n“This is Eighteen East Fifty-seventh Street,” conceded the other\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got his letter here.” She opened her bag, and gave an exclamation\r\nof dismay. “It’s gone!”\r\n\r\n“Mr Sipperley used to have a friend staying with him last Fall. A Mr\r\nRobertson. Dark-complected man with a mustache.”\r\n\r\n“I took it out to look at the address, and I was sure I put it back. I\r\nmust have dropped it.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a Mr Rainsby on the seventh floor. He’s a broker down on Wall\r\nStreet. Short man with an impediment in his speech.”\r\n\r\nJill snapped the clasp of her bag.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” she said. “I must have made a mistake. I was quite sure\r\nthat this was the address, but it evidently isn’t. Thank you so much.\r\nI’m so sorry to have bothered you.”\r\n\r\nShe walked away, leaving the Terror of Paraguay and all points west\r\nspeechless: for people who said “Thank you so much” to him were even\r\nrarer than those who said “please.” He followed her with an\r\naffectionate eye till she was out of sight, then, restoring his\r\nchewing-gum to circulation, returned to the perusal of his paper. A\r\nmomentary suggestion presented itself to his mind that what Jill had\r\nreally wanted was Mr Willoughby on the eighth floor, but it was too\r\nlate to say so now: and soon, becoming absorbed in the narrative of a\r\nspirited householder in Kansas who had run amuck with a hatchet and\r\nslain six, he dismissed the matter from his mind.\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nJill walked back to Fifth Avenue, crossed it, and made her way\r\nthoughtfully along the breezy street which, flanked on one side by the\r\nPark and on the other by the green-roofed Plaza Hotel and the apartment\r\nhouses of the wealthy, ends in the humbler and more democratic spaces\r\nof Columbus Circle. She perceived that she was in that position,\r\nfamiliar to melodrama, of being alone in a great city. The reflection\r\nbrought with it a certain discomfort. The bag that dangled from her\r\nwrist contained all the money she had in the world, the very broken\r\nremains of the twenty dollars which Uncle Chris had sent her at\r\nBrookport. She had nowhere to go, nowhere to sleep, and no immediately\r\nobvious means of adding to her capital. It was a situation which she\r\nhad not foreseen when she set out to walk to Brookport station.\r\n\r\nShe pondered over the mystery of Uncle Chris’ disappearance, and found\r\nno solution. The thing was inexplicable. She was as sure of the address\r\nhe had given in his letter as she was of anything in the world. Yet at\r\nthat address nothing had been heard of him. His name was not even\r\nknown. These were deeper waters than Jill was able to fathom.\r\n\r\nShe walked on, aimlessly. Presently she came to Columbus Circle, and,\r\ncrossing Broadway at the point where that street breaks out into an\r\neruption of automobile stores, found herself suddenly hungry, opposite\r\na restaurant whose entire front was a sheet of plate glass. On the\r\nother side of this glass, at marble-topped tables, apparently careless\r\nof their total lack of privacy, sat the impecunious, lunching, their\r\nevery mouthful a spectacle for the passer-by. It reminded Jill of\r\nlooking at fishes in an aquarium. In the center of the window, gazing\r\nout in a distrait manner over piles of apples and grape-fruit, a\r\nwhite-robed ministrant at a stove juggled ceaselessly with buckwheat\r\ncakes. He struck the final note in the candidness of the establishment,\r\na priest whose ritual contained no mysteries. Spectators with\r\nsufficient time on their hands to permit them to stand and watch were\r\nenabled to witness a New York mid-day meal in every stage of its\r\ncareer, from its protoplasmic beginnings as a stream of yellowish-white\r\nliquid poured on top of the stove to its ultimate Nirvana in the\r\ninterior of the luncher in the form of an appetising cake. It was a\r\nspectacle which no hungry girl could resist. Jill went in, and, as she\r\nmade her way among the tables, a voice spoke her name.\r\n\r\n“Miss Mariner!”\r\n\r\nJill jumped, and thought for a moment that the thing must have been an\r\nhallucination. It was impossible that anybody in the place should have\r\ncalled her name. Except for Uncle Chris, wherever he might be, she knew\r\nno one in New York. Then the voice spoke again, competing valiantly\r\nwith a clatter of crockery so uproarious as to be more like something\r\nsolid than a mere sound.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t believe it was you!”\r\n\r\nA girl in blue had risen from the nearest table, and was staring at her\r\nin astonishment, Jill recognized her instantly. Those big, pathetic\r\neyes, like a lost child’s, were unmistakable. It was the parrot girl,\r\nthe girl whom she and Freddie Rooke had found in the drawing-room, at\r\nOvington Square that afternoon when the foundations of the world had\r\ngiven way and chaos had begun.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!” cried Jill. “I thought you were in London!”\r\n\r\nThat feeling of emptiness and panic, the result of her interview with\r\nthe Guatemalan general at the apartment house, vanished magically. She\r\nsat down at this unexpected friend’s table with a light heart.\r\n\r\n“Whatever are you doing in New York?” asked the girl. “I never knew you\r\nmeant to come over.”\r\n\r\n“It was a little sudden. Still, here I am. And I’m starving. What are\r\nthose things you’re eating?”\r\n\r\n“Buckwheat cakes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. I remember Uncle Chris talking about them on the boat. I’ll\r\nhave some.”\r\n\r\n“But when did you come over?”\r\n\r\n“I landed about ten days ago. I’ve been down at a place called\r\nBrookport on Long Island. How funny running into you like this!”\r\n\r\n“I was surprised that you remembered me.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve forgotten your name,” admitted Jill frankly. “But that’s nothing.\r\nI always forget names.”\r\n\r\n“My name’s Nelly Bryant.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. And you’re on the stage, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’ve just got work with Goble and Cohn. … Hullo, Phil!”\r\n\r\nA young man with a lithe figure and smooth black hair brushed straight\r\nback from his forehead had paused at the table on his way to the\r\ncashier’s desk.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Nelly.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know you lunched here.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t often. Been rehearsing with Joe up at the Century Roof, and had\r\na quarter of an hour to get a bite. Can I sit down?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. This is my friend, Miss Mariner.”\r\n\r\nThe young man shook hands with Jill, flashing an approving glance at\r\nher out of his dark, restless eyes.\r\n\r\n“Pleased to meet you.”\r\n\r\n“This is Phil Brown,” said Nelly. “He plays the straight for Joe\r\nWidgeon. They’re the best jazz-and-hokum team on the Keith Circuit.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, hush!” said Mr Brown modestly. “You always were a great little\r\nbooster, Nelly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know you are! Weren’t you held over at the Palace last time!\r\nWell, then!”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” admitted the young man. “Maybe we didn’t gool ’em, eh?\r\nStop me on the street and ask me! Only eighteen bows second house\r\nSaturday!”\r\n\r\nJill was listening, fascinated.\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand a word,” she said. “It’s like another language.”\r\n\r\n“You’re from the other side, aren’t you?” asked Mr Brown.\r\n\r\n“She only landed a week ago,” said Nelly.\r\n\r\n“I thought so from the accent,” said Mr Brown. “So our talk sort of\r\ngoes over the top, does it? Well, you’ll learn American soon, if you\r\nstick around.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve learned some already,” said Jill. The relief of meeting Nelly had\r\nmade her feel very happy. She liked this smooth-haired young man. “A\r\nman on the train this morning said to me, ‘Would you care for the\r\nmorning paper, sister?’ I said, ‘No, thanks, brother, I want to look\r\nout of the window and think!’”\r\n\r\n“You meet a lot of fresh guys on trains,” commented Mr Brown austerely.\r\n“You want to give ’em the cold-storage eye.” He turned to Nelly. “Did\r\nyou go down to Ike, as I told you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did you cop?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I never felt so happy in my life. I’d waited over an hour on that\r\nlanding of theirs, and then Johnny Miller came along, and I yelled in\r\nhis ear that I was after work, and he told me it would be all right.\r\nHe’s awfully good to girls who’ve worked in shows for him before. If it\r\nhadn’t been for him I might have been waiting there still.”\r\n\r\n“Who,” enquired Jill, anxious to be abreast of the conversation, “is\r\nIke?”\r\n\r\n“Mr Goble. Where I’ve just got work. Goble and Cohn, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I never heard of them!”\r\n\r\nThe young man extended his hand.\r\n\r\n“Put it there!” he said. “They never heard of me! At least, the fellow\r\nI saw when I went down to the office hadn’t! Can you beat it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, did you go down there, too?” asked Nelly.\r\n\r\n“Sure. Joe wanted to get in another show on Broadway. He’d sort of got\r\ntired of vodevil. Say, I don’t want to scare you, Nelly, but, if you\r\nask me, that show they’re putting out down there is a citron! I don’t\r\nthink Ike’s got a cent of his own money in it. My belief is that he’s\r\nrunning it for a lot of amateurs. Why, say, listen! Joe and I blow in\r\nthere to see if there’s anything for us, and there’s a tall guy in\r\ntortoiseshell cheaters sitting in Ike’s office. Said he was the author\r\nand was engaging the principals. We told him who we were, and it didn’t\r\nmake any hit with him at all. He said he had never heard of us. And,\r\nwhen we explained, he said no, there wasn’t going to be any of our sort\r\nof work in the show. Said he was making an effort to give the public\r\nsomething rather better than the usual sort of thing. No specialties\r\nrequired. He said it was an effort to restore the Gilbert and Sullivan\r\ntradition. Say, who are these Gilbert and Sullivan guys, anyway? They\r\nget written up in the papers all the time, and I never met any one\r\nwho’d run across them. If you want my opinion, that show down there is\r\na comic opera!”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake!” Nelly had the musical comedy performer’s horror of\r\nthe older-established form of entertainment. “Why, comic opera died in\r\nthe year one!”\r\n\r\n“Well, these guys are going to dig it up. That’s the way it looks to\r\nme.” He lowered his voice. “Say, I saw Clarice last night,” he said in\r\na confidential undertone. “It’s all right.”\r\n\r\n“It is?”\r\n\r\n“We’ve made it up. It was like this …”\r\n\r\nHis conversation took an intimate turn. He expounded for Nelly’s\r\nbenefit the inner history, with all its ramifications, of a recent\r\nunfortunate rift between himself and “the best little girl in\r\nFlatbush,”—what he had said, what she had said, what her sister had\r\nsaid, and how it all come right in the end. Jill might have felt a\r\nlittle excluded, but for the fact that a sudden and exciting idea had\r\ncome to her. She sat back, thinking. … After all, what else was she to\r\ndo? She must do something. …\r\n\r\nShe bent forward and interrupted Mr Brown in his description of a brisk\r\npassage of arms between himself and the best little girl’s sister, who\r\nseemed to be an unpleasant sort of person in every way.\r\n\r\n“Mr Brown.”\r\n\r\n“Hello?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think there would be any chance for me if I asked for work at\r\nGoble and Cohn’s?”\r\n\r\n“You’re joking!” cried Nelly.\r\n\r\n“I’m not at all.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you want with work?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got to find some. And right away, too.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\nJill hesitated. She disliked discussing her private affairs, but there\r\nwas obviously no way of avoiding it. Nelly was round-eyed and\r\nmystified, and Mr Brown had manifestly no intention whatever of\r\nwithdrawing tactfully. He wanted to hear all.\r\n\r\n“I’ve lost my money,” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“Lost your money! Do you mean … ?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve lost it all. Every penny I had in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Tough!” interpolated Mr Brown judicially. “I was broke once way out in\r\na tank-town in Oklahoma. The manager skipped with our salaries. Last we\r\nsaw of him he was doing the trip to Canada in nothing flat.”\r\n\r\n“But how?” gasped Nelly.\r\n\r\n“It happened about the time we met in London. Do you remember Freddie\r\nRooke, who was at our house that after-noon?”\r\n\r\nA dreamy look came into Nelly’s eyes. There had not been an hour since\r\ntheir parting when she had not thought of that immaculate sportsman. It\r\nwould have amazed Freddie, could he have known, but to Nelly Bryant he\r\nwas the one perfect man in an imperfect world.\r\n\r\n“Do I!” she sighed ecstatically.\r\n\r\nMr Brown shot a keen glance at her.\r\n\r\n“Aha!” he cried facetiously. “Who is he, Nelly? Who is this blue-eyed\r\nboy?”\r\n\r\n“If you want to know,” said Nelly, defiance in her tone, “he’s the\r\nfellow who gave me fifty pounds, with no strings tied to it,—get\r\nthat!—when I was broke in London! If it hadn’t been for him, I’d be\r\nthere still.”\r\n\r\n“Did he?” cried Jill. “Freddie!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Oh, Gee!” Nelly sighed once more. “I suppose I’ll never see him\r\nagain in this world.”\r\n\r\n“Introduce me to him, if you do,” said Mr Brown. “He sounds just the\r\nsort of little pal I’d like to have!”\r\n\r\n“You remember hearing Freddie say something about losing money in a\r\nslump on the Stock Exchange,” proceeded Jill. “Well, that was how I\r\nlost mine. It’s a long story, and it’s not worth talking about, but\r\nthat’s how things stand, and I’ve got to find work of some sort, and it\r\nlooks to me as if I should have a better chance of finding it on the\r\nstage than anywhere else.”\r\n\r\n“I’m terribly sorry.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s all right. How much would these people Goble and Cohn give me\r\nif I got an engagement?”\r\n\r\n“Only forty a week.”\r\n\r\n“Forty dollars a week! It’s wealth! Where are they?”\r\n\r\n“Over at the Gotham Theatre in Forty-second Street.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go there at once.”\r\n\r\n“But you’ll hate it. You don’t realize what it’s like. You wait hours\r\nand hours and nobody sees you.”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t I walk straight in and say that I’ve come for work?”\r\n\r\nNelly’s big eyes grew bigger.\r\n\r\n“But you couldn’t!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you couldn’t!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why.”\r\n\r\nMr Brown intervened with decision.\r\n\r\n“You’re dead right,” he said to Jill approvingly. “If you ask me,\r\nthat’s the only sensible thing to do. Where’s the sense of hanging\r\naround and getting stalled? Managers are human guys, some of ’em.\r\nProbably, if you were to try it, they’d appreciate a bit of gall. It\r\nwould show ’em you’d got pep. You go down there and try walking\r\nstraight in. They can’t eat you. It makes me sick when I see all those\r\npoor devils hanging about outside these offices, waiting to get noticed\r\nand nobody ever paying any attention to them. You push the office-boy\r\nin the face if he tries to stop you, and go in and make ’em take\r\nnotice. And, whatever you do, don’t leave your name and address! That’s\r\nthe old, moth-eaten gag they’re sure to try to pull on you. Tell ’em\r\nthere’s nothing doing. Say you’re out for a quick decision! Stand ’em\r\non their heads!”\r\n\r\nJill got up, fired by this eloquence. She called for her check.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” she said. “I’m going to do exactly as you say. Where can I\r\nfind you afterwards?” she said to Nelly.\r\n\r\n“You aren’t really going?”\r\n\r\n“I am!”\r\n\r\nNelly scribbled on a piece of paper.\r\n\r\n“Here’s my address. I’ll be in all evening.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll come and see you. Good-bye, Mr Brown. And thank you.”\r\n\r\n“You’re welcome!” said Mr Brown.\r\n\r\nNelly watched Jill depart with wide eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why did you tell her to do that?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said Mr Brown. “I started something, didn’t I? Well, I guess\r\nI’ll have to be leaving, too. Got to get back to rehearsal. Say, I like\r\nthat friend of yours, Nelly. There’s no yellow streak about her! I wish\r\nher luck!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nTHE offices of Messrs Goble and Cohn were situated, like everything\r\nelse in New York that appertains to the drama, in the neighborhood of\r\nTimes Square. They occupied the fifth floor of the Gotham Theatre on\r\nWest Forty-second Street. As there was no elevator in the building\r\nexcept the small private one used by the two members of the firm, Jill\r\nwalked up the stairs, and found signs of a thriving business beginning\r\nto present themselves as early as the third floor, where half a dozen\r\npatient persons of either sex had draped themselves like roosting fowls\r\nupon the banisters. There were more on the fourth floor, and the\r\nlanding of the fifth, which served the firm as a waiting-room, was\r\nquite full. It is the custom of theatrical managers—the lowest order of\r\nintelligence, with the possible exception of the _limax maximus_ or\r\ngarden slug, known to science—to omit from their calculations the fact\r\nthat they are likely every day to receive a large number of visitors,\r\nwhom they will be obliged to keep waiting; and that these people will\r\nrequire somewhere to wait. Such considerations never occur to them.\r\nMessrs Goble and Cohn had provided for those who called to see them one\r\nsmall bench on the landing, conveniently situated at the intersecting\r\npoint of three draughts, and had let it go at that.\r\n\r\nNobody, except perhaps the night-watchman, had ever seen this bench\r\nempty. At whatever hour of the day you happened to call, you would\r\nalways find three wistful individuals seated side by side with their\r\neyes on the tiny ante-room where sat the office-boy, the\r\ntelephone-girl, and Mr Goble’s stenographer. Beyond this was the door\r\nmarked “Private,” through which, as it opened to admit some careless,\r\ndebonair, thousand-dollar-a-week comedian who sauntered in with a\r\njaunty “Hello, Ike!” or some furred and scented female star, the rank\r\nand file of the profession were greeted, like Moses on Pisgah, with a\r\nfleeting glimpse of the promised land, consisting of a large desk and a\r\nsection of a very fat man with spectacles and a bald head or a younger\r\nman with fair hair and a double chin.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of the mass meeting on the landing was one of determined,\r\nalmost aggressive smartness. The men wore bright overcoats with bands\r\nround the waist, the women those imitation furs which to the\r\nuninitiated eye appear so much more expensive than the real thing.\r\nEverybody looked very dashing and very young, except about the eyes.\r\nMost of the eyes that glanced at Jill were weary. The women were nearly\r\nall blondes, blondness having been decided upon in the theatre as the\r\ncolor that brings the best results. The men were all so much alike that\r\nthey seemed to be members of one large family,—an illusion which was\r\nheightened by the scraps of conversation, studded with “dears,” “old\r\nmans,” and “honeys,” which came to Jill’s ears. A stern fight for\r\nsupremacy was being waged by a score or so of lively and powerful young\r\nscents.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Jill was somewhat daunted by the spectacle, but she\r\nrecovered almost immediately. The exhilarating and heady influence of\r\nNew York still wrought within her. The Berserk spirit was upon her, and\r\nshe remembered the stimulating words of Mr Brown, of Brown and Widgeon,\r\nthe best jazz-and-hokum team on the Keith Circuit. “Walk straight in!”\r\nhad been the burden of his inspiring address. She pushed her way\r\nthrough the crowd until she came to the small ante-room.\r\n\r\nIn the ante-room were the outposts, the pickets of the enemy. In one\r\ncorner a girl was hammering energetically and with great speed on a\r\ntypewriter: a second girl, seated at a switchboard, was having an\r\nargument with Central which was already warm and threatened to descend\r\nshortly to personalities: on a chair tilted back so that it rested\r\nagainst the wall, a small boy sat eating candy and reading the comic\r\npage of an evening newspaper. All three were enclosed, like zoological\r\nspecimens, in a cage formed by a high counter terminating in brass\r\nbars.\r\n\r\nBeyond these watchers on the threshold was the door marked “Private.”\r\nThrough it, as Jill reached the outer defences, filtered the sound of a\r\npiano.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied the subject have come to the conclusion that the\r\nboorishness of theatrical managers’ office-boys cannot be the product\r\nof mere chance. Somewhere, in some sinister den in the criminal\r\ndistricts of the town, there is a school where small boys are trained\r\nfor these positions, where their finer instincts are rigorously\r\nuprooted and rudeness systematically inculcated by competent\r\nprofessors. Of this school the candy-eating Cerberus of Messrs Goble\r\nand Cohn had been the star scholar. Quickly seeing his natural gifts,\r\nhis teachers had given him special attention. When he had graduated, it\r\nhad been amidst the cordial good wishes of the entire faculty. They had\r\ntaught him all they knew, and they were proud of him. They felt that he\r\nwould do them credit.\r\n\r\nThis boy raised a pair of pink-rimmed eyes to Jill, sniffed—for like\r\nall theatrical managers’ office-boys he had a permanent cold in the\r\nhead—bit his thumb-nail, and spoke. He was a snub-nosed boy. His ears\r\nand hair were vermilion. His name was Ralph. He had seven hundred and\r\nforty-three pimples.\r\n\r\n“Woddyerwant?” enquired Ralph, coming within an ace of condensing the\r\nquestion into a word of one syllable.\r\n\r\n“I want to see Mr Goble.”\r\n\r\n“Zout!” said the Pimple King, and returned to his paper.\r\n\r\nThere will, no doubt, always be class distinctions. Sparta had her\r\nkings and her helots, King Arthur’s Round Table its knights and its\r\nscullions, America her Simon Legree and her Uncle Tom. But in no nation\r\nand at no period of history has any one ever been so brutally superior\r\nto any one else as is the Broadway theatrical office-boy to the caller\r\nwho wishes to see the manager. Thomas Jefferson held these truths to be\r\nself-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by\r\ntheir Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these rights\r\nare life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Theatrical office-boys\r\ndo not see eye to eye with Thomas. From their pinnacle they look down\r\non the common herd, the _canaille_, and despise them. They coldly\r\nquestion their right to live.\r\n\r\nJill turned pink. Mr Brown, her guide and mentor, foreseeing this\r\nsituation, had, she remembered, recommended “pushing the office-boy in\r\nthe face”: and for a moment she felt like following his advice.\r\nPrudence, or the fact that he was out of reach behind the brass bars,\r\nrestrained her. Without further delay she made for the door of the\r\ninner room. That was her objective, and she did not intend to be\r\ndiverted from it. Her fingers were on the handle before any of those\r\npresent divined her intention. Then the stenographer stopped typing and\r\nsat with raised fingers, aghast. The girl at the telephone broke off in\r\nmid-sentence and stared round over her shoulder. Ralph, the office-boy,\r\noutraged, dropped his paper and constituted himself the spokesman of\r\nthe invaded force.\r\n\r\n“Hey!”\r\n\r\nJill stopped and eyed the lad militantly.\r\n\r\n“Were you speaking to me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I _was_ speaking to you!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t do it again with your mouth full,” said Jill, turning to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe belligerent fire in the office-boy’s pink-rimmed eyes was suddenly\r\ndimmed by a gush of water. It was not remorse that caused him to weep,\r\nhowever. In the heat of the moment he had swallowed a large, jagged\r\npiece of candy, and he was suffering severely.\r\n\r\n“You can’t go in there!” he managed to articulate, his iron will\r\ntriumphing over the flesh sufficiently to enable him to speak.\r\n\r\n“I _am_ going in there!”\r\n\r\n“That’s Mr Goble’s private room.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I want a private talk with Mr Goble.”\r\n\r\nRalph, his eyes still moist, felt that the situation was slipping from\r\nhis grip. This sort of thing had never happened to him before.\r\n\r\n“I tell ya he _zout!_”\r\n\r\nJill looked at him sternly.\r\n\r\n“You wretched child!” she said, encouraged by a sharp giggle from the\r\nneighborhood of the switchboard. “Do you know where little boys go who\r\ndon’t speak the truth? I can hear him playing the piano. Now he’s\r\nsinging! And it’s no good telling me he’s busy. If he was busy, he\r\nwouldn’t have time to sing. If you’re as deceitful as this at your age,\r\nwhat do you expect to be when you grow up? You’re an ugly little boy,\r\nyou’ve got red ears, and your collar doesn’t fit! I shall speak to Mr\r\nGoble about you.”\r\n\r\nWith which words Jill opened the door and walked in.\r\n\r\n“Good afternoon,” she said brightly.\r\n\r\nAfter the congested and unfurnished discomfort of the landing, the room\r\nin which Jill found herself had an air of cosiness and almost of\r\nluxury. It was a large room, solidly upholstered. Along the further\r\nwall, filling nearly the whole of its space, stood a vast and gleaming\r\ndesk, covered with a litter of papers which rose at one end of it to a\r\nsort of mountain of play-scripts in buff covers. There was a bookshelf\r\nto the left. Photographs covered the walls. Near the window was a deep\r\nleather lounge: to the right of this stood a small piano, the\r\nmusic-stool of which was occupied by a young man with untidy black hair\r\nthat needed cutting. On top of the piano, taking the eye immediately by\r\nreason of its bold brightness, was balanced a large cardboard poster.\r\nMuch of its surface was filled by a picture of a youth in polo costume\r\nbending over a blonde goddess in a bathing-suit. What space was left\r\ndisplayed the legend:\r\n\r\nISAAC GOBLE AND JACOB COHN\r\nPRESENT\r\nTHE ROSE OF AMERICA\r\n(A Musical Fantasy)\r\nBOOK AND LYRICS BY OTIS PILKINGTON\r\nMUSIC BY ROLAND TREVIS\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning her eyes from this, Jill became aware that something was going\r\non at the other side of the desk: and she perceived that a second young\r\nman, the longest and thinnest she had ever seen, was in the act of\r\nrising to his feet, length upon length like an unfolding snake. At the\r\nmoment of her entry he had been lying back in an office-chair, so that\r\nonly a merely nominal section of his upper structure was visible. Now\r\nhe reared his impressive length until his head came within measurable\r\ndistance of the ceiling. He had a hatchet face and a receding chin, and\r\nhe gazed at Jill through what she assumed were the “tortoiseshell\r\ncheaters” referred to by her recent acquaintance, Mr Brown.\r\n\r\n“Er … ?” said this young man enquiringly in a high, flat voice.\r\n\r\nJill, like many other people, had a brain which was under the\r\nalternating control of two diametrically opposite forces. It was like\r\nan automobile steered in turn by two drivers, the one a dashing,\r\nreckless fellow with no regard for the speed limits, the other a timid\r\nnovice. All through the proceedings up to this point the dasher had\r\nbeen in command. He had whisked her along at a break-neck pace,\r\nignoring obstacles and police regulations. Now, having brought her to\r\nthis situation, he abruptly abandoned the wheel and turned it over to\r\nhis colleague, the shrinker. Jill, greatly daring a moment ago, now\r\nfelt an overwhelming shyness.\r\n\r\nShe gulped, and her heart beat quickly. The thin man towered over her.\r\nThe black-haired pianist shook his locks at her like Banquo.\r\n\r\n“I …” she began.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, womanly intuition came to her aid. Something seemed to\r\ntell her that these men were just as scared as she was. And, at the\r\ndiscovery, the dashing driver resumed his post at the wheel, and she\r\nbegan to deal with the situation with composure.\r\n\r\n“I want to see Mr Goble.”\r\n\r\n“Mr Goble is out,” said the long young man, plucking nervously at the\r\npapers on the desk. Jill had affected him powerfully.\r\n\r\n“Out!” She felt she had wronged the pimpled office-boy.\r\n\r\n“We are not expecting him back this afternoon. Is there anything I can\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\nHe spoke tenderly. This weak-minded young man—at school his coarse\r\ncompanions had called him Simp—was thinking that he had never seen\r\nanything like Jill before. And it was true that she was looking very\r\npretty, with her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkling. She touched a\r\nchord in the young man which seemed to make the world a flower-scented\r\nthing, full of soft music. Often as he had been in love at first sight\r\nbefore in his time, Otis Pilkington could not recall an occasion on\r\nwhich he had been in love at first sight more completely than now. When\r\nshe smiled at him, it was as if the gates of heaven had opened. He did\r\nnot reflect how many times, in similar circumstances, these same gates\r\nhad opened before; and that on one occasion when they had done so it\r\nhad cost him eight thousand dollars to settle the case out of court.\r\nOne does not think of these things at such times, for they strike a\r\njarring note. Otis Pilkington was in love. That was all he knew, or\r\ncared to know.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you take a seat, Miss …”\r\n\r\n“Mariner,” prompted Jill. “Thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Mariner. May I introduce Mr Roland Trevis?”\r\n\r\nThe man at the piano bowed. His black hair heaved upon his skull like\r\nseaweed in a ground swell.\r\n\r\n“My name is Pilkington. Otis Pilkington.”\r\n\r\nThe uncomfortable silence which always follows introductions was broken\r\nby the sound of the telephone-bell on the desk. Otis Pilkington, who\r\nhad moved out into the room and was nowhere near the desk, stretched\r\nforth a preposterous arm and removed the receiver.\r\n\r\n“Yes? Oh, will you say, please, that I have a conference at present.”\r\nJill was to learn that people in the theatrical business never talked:\r\nthey always held conferences. “Tell Mrs Peagrim that I shall be calling\r\nlater in the afternoon, but cannot be spared just now.” He replaced the\r\nreceiver. “Aunt Olive’s secretary,” he murmured in a soft aside to Mr\r\nTrevis. “Aunt Olive wanted me to go for a ride.” He turned to Jill.\r\n“Excuse me. Is there anything I can do for you, Miss Mariner?”\r\n\r\nJill’s composure was now completely restored. This interview was\r\nturning out so totally different from anything she had expected. The\r\natmosphere was cosy and social. She felt as if she were back in\r\nOvington Square, giving tea to Freddie Rooke and Ronny Devereux and the\r\nrest of her friends of the London period. All that was needed to\r\ncomplete the picture was a tea-table in front of her. The business note\r\nhardly intruded on the proceedings at all. Still, as business was the\r\nobject of her visit, she felt that she had better approach it.\r\n\r\n“I came for work.”\r\n\r\n“Work!” cried Mr Pilkington. He, too, appeared to be regarding the\r\ninterview as purely of a social nature.\r\n\r\n“In the chorus,” explained Jill.\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington seemed shocked. He winced away from the word as though it\r\npained him.\r\n\r\n“There is no chorus in ‘The Rose of America,’” he said.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was a musical comedy.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington winced again.\r\n\r\n“It is a musical _fantasy!_” he said. “But there will be no chorus. We\r\nshall have,” he added, a touch of rebuke in his voice, “the services of\r\ntwelve refined ladies of the ensemble.”\r\n\r\nJill laughed.\r\n\r\n“It does sound much better, doesn’t it!” she said. “Well, am I refined\r\nenough, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I shall be only too happy if you will join us,” said Mr Pilkington\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\nThe long-haired composer looked doubtful. He struck a note up in the\r\ntreble, then whirled round on his stool.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind my mentioning it, Otie, we have twelve girls\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“Then we must have thirteen,” said Otis Pilkington firmly.\r\n\r\n“Unlucky number,” argued Mr Trevis.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care. We must have Miss Mariner. You can see for yourself that\r\nshe is exactly the type we need.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke feelingly. Ever since the business of engaging a company had\r\nbegun, he had been thinking wistfully of the evening when “The Rose of\r\nAmerica” had had its opening performance—at his aunt’s house at Newport\r\nlast Summer—with an all-star cast of society favorites and an ensemble\r\nrecruited entirely from debutantes and matrons of the Younger Set. That\r\nwas the sort of company he had longed to assemble for the piece’s\r\nprofessional career, and until this afternoon he had met with nothing\r\nbut disappointment. Jill seemed to be the only girl in theatrical New\r\nYork who came up to the standard he would have liked to demand.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much,” said Jill.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. The social note crept into the atmosphere\r\nagain. Jill felt the hostess’ desire to keep conversation circulating.\r\n\r\n“I hear,” she said, “that this piece is a sort of Gilbert and Sullivan\r\nopera.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington considered the point.\r\n\r\n“I confess,” he said, “that, in writing the book, I had Gilbert before\r\nme as a model. Whether I have in any sense succeeded in …”\r\n\r\n“The book,” said Mr Trevis, running his fingers over the piano, “is as\r\ngood as anything Gilbert ever wrote.”\r\n\r\n“Oh come, Rolie!” protested Mr Pilkington modestly.\r\n\r\n“Better,” insisted Mr Trevis. “For one thing, it is up-to-date.”\r\n\r\n“I _do_ try to strike the modern tone,” murmured Mr Pilkington.\r\n\r\n“And you have avoided Gilbert’s mistake of being too fanciful.”\r\n\r\n“He was fanciful,” admitted Mr Pilkington. “The music,” he added, in a\r\ngenerous spirit of give and take, “has all Sullivan’s melody with a\r\nnewness of rhythm peculiarly its own. You will like the music.”\r\n\r\n“It sounds,” said Jill amiably, “as though the piece is bound to be a\r\ntremendous success.”\r\n\r\n“We hope so,” said Mr Pilkington. “We feel that the time has come when\r\nthe public is beginning to demand something better than what it has\r\nbeen accustomed to. People are getting tired of the brainless trash and\r\njingly tunes which have been given them by men like Wallace Mason and\r\nGeorge Bevan. They want a certain polish. … It was just the same in\r\nGilbert and Sullivan’s day. They started writing at a time when the\r\nmusical stage had reached a terrible depth of inanity. The theatre was\r\ngiven over to burlesques of the most idiotic description. The public\r\nwas waiting eagerly to welcome something of a higher class. It is just\r\nthe same today. But the managers will not see it. ‘The Rose of America’\r\nwent up and down Broadway for months, knocking at managers’ doors.”\r\n\r\n“It should have walked in without knocking, like me,” said Jill. She\r\ngot up. “Well, it was very kind of you to see me when I came in so\r\nunceremoniously. But I felt it was no good waiting outside on that\r\nlanding. I’m so glad everything is settled. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Miss Mariner.” Mr Pilkington took her outstretched hand\r\ndevoutly. “There is a rehearsal called for the ensemble at—when is it,\r\nRolie?”\r\n\r\n“Eleven o’clock, day after tomorrow, at Bryant Hall.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be there,” said Jill. “Good-bye, and thank you very much.”\r\n\r\nThe silence which had fallen upon the room as she left it, was broken\r\nby Mr Trevis.\r\n\r\n“Some pip!” observed Mr Trevis.\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington awoke from day-dreams with a start.\r\n\r\n“What did you say?”\r\n\r\n“That girl … I said she was some pippin!”\r\n\r\n“Miss Mariner,” said Mr Pilkington icily, “is a most charming, refined,\r\ncultured, and vivacious girl, if you mean that.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr Trevis. “That was what I meant!”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nJill walked out into Forty-second Street, looking about her with the\r\neye of a conqueror. Very little change had taken place in the aspect of\r\nNew York since she had entered the Gotham Theatre, but it seemed a\r\ndifferent city to her. An hour ago, she had been a stranger, drifting\r\naimlessly along its rapids. Now she belonged to New York, and New York\r\nbelonged to her. She had faced it squarely, and forced from it the\r\nmeans of living. She walked on with a new jauntiness in her stride.\r\n\r\nThe address which Nelly had given her was on the east side of Fifth\r\nAvenue. She made her way along Forty-second Street. It seemed the\r\njolliest, alivest street she had ever encountered. The rattle of the\r\nElevated as she crossed Sixth Avenue was music, and she loved the\r\ncrowds that jostled her with every step she took.\r\n\r\nShe reached the Fifth Avenue corner just as the policeman out in the\r\nmiddle of the street swung his Stop-and-Go post round to allow the\r\nup-town traffic to proceed on its way. A stream of automobiles which\r\nhad been dammed up as far as the eye could reach began to flow swiftly\r\npast. They moved in a double line, red limousines, blue limousines,\r\nmauve limousines, green limousines. She stood waiting for the flood to\r\ncease, and, as she did so, there purred past her the biggest and\r\nreddest limousine of all. It was a colossal vehicle with a polar-bear\r\nat the steering-wheel and another at his side. And in the interior,\r\nvery much at his ease, his gaze bent courteously upon a massive lady in\r\na mink coat, sat Uncle Chris.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was so near to her that, but for the closed window, she\r\ncould have touched him. Then the polar-bear at the wheel, noting a gap\r\nin the traffic, stepped on the accelerator and slipped neatly through.\r\nThe car moved swiftly on and disappeared.\r\n\r\nJill drew a deep breath. The Stop-and-Go sign swung round again. She\r\ncrossed the avenue, and set out once more to find Nelly Bryant. It\r\noccurred to her, five minutes later, that a really practical and\r\nquick-thinking girl would have noted the number of the limousine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nThe rehearsals of a musical comedy—a term which embraces “musical\r\nfantasies”—generally begin in a desultory sort of way at that curious\r\nbuilding, Bryant Hall, on Sixth Avenue just off Forty-second Street.\r\nThere, in a dusty, uncarpeted room, simply furnished with a few wooden\r\nchairs and some long wooden benches, the chorus—or, in the case of “The\r\nRose of America,” the ensemble—sit round a piano and endeavor, with the\r\nassistance of the musical director, to get the words and melodies of\r\nthe first-act numbers into their heads. This done, they are ready for\r\nthe dance director to instil into them the steps, the groupings, and\r\nthe business for the encores, of which that incurable optimist always\r\nseems to expect there will be at least six. Later, the principals are\r\ninjected into the numbers. And finally, leaving Bryant Hall and dodging\r\nabout from one unoccupied theatre to another, principals and chorus\r\nrehearse together, running through the entire piece over and over again\r\ntill the opening night of the preliminary road tour.\r\n\r\nTo Jill, in the early stages, rehearsing was just like being back at\r\nschool. She could remember her first school-mistress, whom the musical\r\ndirector somewhat resembled in manner and appearance, hammering out\r\nhymns on a piano and leading in a weak soprano an eager, baying pack of\r\nchildren, each anxious from motives of pride to out-bawl her nearest\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings began on the first morning with the entrance of Mr\r\nSaltzburg, the musical director, a brisk, busy little man with\r\nbenevolent eyes behind big spectacles, who bustled over to the piano,\r\nsat down, and played a loud chord, designed to act as a sort of bugle\r\nblast, rallying the ladies of the ensemble from the corners where they\r\nsat in groups, chatting. For the process of making one another’s\r\nacquaintance had begun some ten minutes before with mutual recognitions\r\nbetween those who knew each other from having been together in previous\r\nproductions. There followed rapid introductions of friends. Nelly\r\nBryant had been welcomed warmly by a pretty girl with red hair, whom\r\nshe introduced to Jill as Babe: Babe had a willowy blonde friend, named\r\nLois: and the four of them had seated themselves on one of the benches\r\nand opened a conversation; their numbers being added to a moment later\r\nby a dark girl with a Southern accent and another blonde. Elsewhere\r\nother groups had formed, and the room was filled with a noise like the\r\nchattering of starlings. In a body by themselves, rather forlorn and\r\nneglected, half a dozen solemn and immaculately dressed young men were\r\npropping themselves up against the wall and looking on, like men in a\r\nball-room who do not dance.\r\n\r\nJill listened to the conversation without taking any great part in it\r\nherself. She felt as she had done on her first day at school, a little\r\nshy and desirous of effacing herself. The talk dealt with clothes, men,\r\nand the show business, in that order of importance. Presently one of\r\nthe young men sauntered diffidently across the room and added himself\r\nto the group with the remark that it was a fine day. He was received a\r\nlittle grudgingly, Jill thought, but by degrees succeeded in\r\nassimilating himself. A second young man drifted up; reminded the\r\nwillowy girl that they had worked together in the western company of\r\n“You’re the One”; was recognized and introduced; and justified his\r\nadmission to the circle by a creditable imitation of a cat-fight. Five\r\nminutes later he was addressing the Southern girl as “honey,” and had\r\ninformed Jill that he had only joined this show to fill in before\r\nopening on the three-a-day with the swellest little song-and-dance act\r\nwhich he and a little girl who worked in the cabaret at Geisenheimer’s\r\nhad fixed up.\r\n\r\nOn this scene of harmony and good-fellowship Mr Saltzburg’s chord\r\nintruded jarringly. There was a general movement, and chairs and\r\nbenches were dragged to the piano. Mr Saltzburg causing a momentary\r\ndelay by opening a large brown music-bag and digging in it like a\r\nterrier at a rat-hole, conversation broke out again.\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg emerged from the bag, with his hands full of papers,\r\nprotesting.\r\n\r\n“Childrun! Chil-_drun!_ If you please, less noise and attend to me!” He\r\ndistributed sheets of paper. “Act One, Opening Chorus. I will play the\r\nmelody three—four times. Follow attentively. Then we will sing it\r\nla-la-la, and after that we will sing the words. So!”\r\n\r\nHe struck the yellow-keyed piano a vicious blow, producing a tinny and\r\ncomplaining sound. Bending forward with his spectacles almost touching\r\nthe music, he plodded determinedly through the tune, then encored\r\nhimself, and after that encored himself again. When he had done this,\r\nhe removed his spectacles and wiped them. There was a pause.\r\n\r\n“Izzy,” observed the willowy young lady chattily, leaning across Jill\r\nand addressing the Southern girl’s blonde friend, “has promised me a\r\nsunburst!”\r\n\r\nA general stir of interest and a coming close together of heads.\r\n\r\n“What! Izzy!”\r\n\r\n“Sure, Izzy.”\r\n\r\n“Well!”\r\n\r\n“He’s just landed the hat-check privilege at the St Aurea!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say!”\r\n\r\n“He told me so last night and promised me the sunburst. He was,”\r\nadmitted the willowy girl regretfully, “a good bit tanked at the time,\r\nbut I guess he’ll make good.” She mused awhile, a rather anxious\r\nexpression clouding her perfect profile. She looked like a meditative\r\nGreek Goddess. “If he doesn’t,” she added with maidenly dignity, “it’s\r\nthe las’ time _I_ go out with the big stiff. I’d tie a can to him\r\nquicker’n look at him!”\r\n\r\nA murmur of approval greeted this admirable sentiment.\r\n\r\n“Childrun!” protested Mr Saltzburg. “Chil-drun! Less noise and chatter\r\nof conversation. We are here to work! We must not waste time! So! Act\r\nOne, Opening Chorus. Now, all together. La-la-la …”\r\n\r\n“La-la-la …”\r\n\r\n“Tum-tum-tumty-tumty …”\r\n\r\n“Tum-tum-tumty …”\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg pressed his hands to his ears in a spasm of pain.\r\n\r\n“No, no, no! Sour! Sour! Sour!… Once again. La-la-la …”\r\n\r\nA round-faced girl with golden hair and the face of a wondering cherub\r\ninterrupted, speaking with a lisp.\r\n\r\n“Mithter Thalzburg.”\r\n\r\n“Now what is it, Miss Trevor?”\r\n\r\n“What sort of a show is this?”\r\n\r\n“A musical show,” said Mr Saltzburg severely, “and this is a rehearsal\r\nof it, not a conversazione. Once more, please …”\r\n\r\nThe cherub was not to be rebuffed.\r\n\r\n“Is the music good, Mithter Thalzburg?”\r\n\r\n“When you have rehearsed it, you shall judge for yourself. Come, now …”\r\n\r\n“Is there anything in it as good as that waltz of yours you played us\r\nwhen we were rehearthing ‘Mind How You Go?’ You remember. The one that\r\nwent …”\r\n\r\nA tall and stately girl, with sleepy brown eyes and the air of a\r\nduchess in the servants’ hall, bent forward and took a kindly interest\r\nin the conversation.\r\n\r\n“Oh, have you composed a varlse, Mr Saltzburg?” she asked with pleasant\r\ncondescension. “How interesting, really! Won’t you play it for us?”\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the meeting seemed to be unanimous in favor of\r\nshelving work and listening to Mr Saltzburg’s waltz.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr Saltzburg, do!”\r\n\r\n“Please!”\r\n\r\n“Some one told me it was a pipterino!”\r\n\r\n“I cert’nly do love waltzes!”\r\n\r\n“Please, Mr Saltzburg!”\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg obviously weakened. His fingers touched the keys\r\nirresolutely.\r\n\r\n“But, childrun!”\r\n\r\n“I am sure it would be a great pleasure to all of us,” said the duchess\r\ngraciously, “if you would play it. There is nothing I enjoy more than a\r\ngood varlse.”\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg capitulated. Like all musical directors he had in his\r\nleisure moments composed the complete score of a musical play and spent\r\nmuch of his time waylaying librettists on the Rialto and trying to lure\r\nthem to his apartment to listen to it, with a view to business. The\r\neternal tragedy of a musical director’s life is comparable only to that\r\nof the waiter who, himself fasting, has to assist others to eat, Mr\r\nSaltzburg had lofty ideas on music, and his soul revolted at being\r\ncompelled perpetually to rehearse and direct the inferior compositions\r\nof other men. Far less persuasion than he had received today was\r\nusually required to induce him to play the whole of his score.\r\n\r\n“You wish it?” he said. “Well, then! This waltz, you will understand,\r\nis the theme of a musical romance which I have composed. It will be\r\nsung once in the first act by the heroine, then in the second act as a\r\nduet for heroine and hero. I weave it into the finale of the second\r\nact, and we have an echo of it, sung off stage, in the third act. What\r\nI play you now is the second-act duet. The verse is longer. So! The\r\nmale voice begins.”\r\n\r\nA pleasant time was had by all for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but this is not rehearsing, childrun!” cried Mr Saltzburg\r\nremorsefully at the end of that period. “This is not business. Come\r\nnow, the opening chorus of act one, and please this time keep on the\r\nkey. Before, it was sour, sour. Come! La-la-la …”\r\n\r\n“Mr Thalzburg!”\r\n\r\n“Miss Trevor?”\r\n\r\n“There was an awfully thweet fox-trot you used to play us. I do wish …”\r\n\r\n“Some other time, some other time! Now we must work. Come! La-la-la …”\r\n\r\n“I wish you could have heard it, girls,” said the cherub regretfully.\r\n“Honetht, it wath a lalapalootha!”\r\n\r\nThe pack broke into full cry.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr Saltzburg!”\r\n\r\n“Please, Mr Saltzburg!”\r\n\r\n“Do play the fox-trot, Mr Saltzburg!”\r\n\r\n“If it is as good as the varlse,” said the duchess, stooping once more\r\nto the common level, “I am sure it must be very good indeed.” She\r\npowdered her nose. “And one so rarely hears musicianly music nowadays,\r\ndoes one?”\r\n\r\n“Which fox-trot?” asked Mr Saltzburg weakly.\r\n\r\n“Play ’em all!” decided a voice on the left.\r\n\r\n“Yes, play ’em all,” bayed the pack.\r\n\r\n“I am sure that that would be charming,” agreed the duchess, replacing\r\nher powder-puff.\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg played ’em all. This man by now seemed entirely lost to\r\nshame. The precious minutes that belonged to his employers and should\r\nhave been earmarked for “The Rose of America” flitted by. The ladies\r\nand gentlemen of the ensemble, who should have been absorbing and\r\nlearning to deliver the melodies of Roland Trevis and the lyrics of\r\nOtis Pilkington, lolled back in their seats. The yellow-keyed piano\r\nrocked beneath an unprecedented onslaught. The proceedings had begun to\r\nresemble not so much a rehearsal as a home evening, and grateful\r\nglances were cast at the complacent cherub. She had, it was felt, shown\r\ntact and discretion.\r\n\r\nPleasant conversation began again.\r\n\r\n“… And I walked a couple of blocks, and there was exactly the same\r\nmodel in Schwartz and Gulderstein’s window at twenty-six fifty …”\r\n\r\n“… He got on at Forty-second Street, and he was kinda fresh from the\r\nstart. I could see he was carrying a package. At Sixty-sixth he came\r\nsasshaying right down the car and said ‘Hello, patootie!’ Well, I drew\r\nmyself up …”\r\n\r\n“… ‘Even if you are my sister’s husband,’ I said to him. Oh, I suppose\r\nI got a temper. It takes a lot to arouse it, y’know, but I c’n get\r\npretty mad …”\r\n\r\n“… You don’t know the half of it, dearie, you don’t know the half of\r\nit! A one-piece bathing suit! Well, you could call it that, but the cop\r\non the beach said it was more like a baby’s sock. And when …”\r\n\r\n“… So I said ‘Listen, Izzy, that’ll be about all from you! My father\r\nwas a gentleman, though I don’t suppose you know what that means, and\r\nI’m not accustomed …’”\r\n\r\n“Hey!”\r\n\r\nA voice from the neighborhood of the door had cut into the babble like\r\na knife into butter; a rough, rasping voice, loud and compelling, which\r\ncaused the conversation of the members of the ensemble to cease on the\r\ninstant. Only Mr Saltzburg, now in a perfect frenzy of musicianly\r\nfervor, continued to assault the decrepit piano, unwitting of an\r\nunsympathetic addition to his audience.\r\n\r\n“What I play you now is the laughing trio from my second act. It is a\r\nbuilding number. It is sung by tenor, principal comedian, and\r\nsoubrette. On the second refrain four girls will come out and two boys.\r\nThe girls will dance with the two men, the boys with the soubrette. So!\r\nOn the encore, four more girls and two more boys. Third encore,\r\nsolo-dance for specialty dancer, all on stage beating time by clapping\r\ntheir hands. On repeat, all sing refrain once more, and off-encore, the\r\nthree principals and specialty dancer dance the dance with entire\r\nchorus. It is a great building number, you understand. It is enough to\r\nmake the success of any musical play, but can I get a hearing? No! If I\r\nask managers to listen to my music, they are busy! If I beg them to\r\ngive me a libretto to set, they laugh—ha! ha!” Mr Saltzburg gave a\r\nspirited and lifelike representation of a manager laughing ha-ha when\r\nbegged to disgorge a libretto. “Now I play it once more!”\r\n\r\n“Like hell you do!” said the voice. “Say, what is this, anyway? A\r\nconcert?”\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg swung round on the music-stool, a startled and\r\napprehensive man, and nearly fell off it. The divine afflatus left him\r\nlike air oozing from a punctured toy-balloon, and, like such a balloon,\r\nhe seemed to grow suddenly limp and flat. He stared with fallen jaw at\r\nthe new arrival.\r\n\r\nTwo men had entered the room. One was the long Mr Pilkington. The\r\nother, who looked shorter and stouter than he really was beside his\r\ngiraffe-like companion, was a thickset, fleshy man in the early\r\nthirties with a blond, clean-shaven, double-chinned face. He had smooth\r\nyellow hair, an unwholesome complexion, and light green eyes, set close\r\ntogether. From the edge of the semi-circle about the piano, he glared\r\nmenacingly over the heads of the chorus at the unfortunate Mr\r\nSaltzburg,\r\n\r\n“Why aren’t these girls working?”\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg, who had risen nervously from his stool, backed away\r\napprehensively from his gaze, and, stumbling over the stool, sat down\r\nabruptly on the piano, producing a curious noise like Futurist music.\r\n\r\n“I—We—Why, Mr Goble …”\r\n\r\nMr Goble turned his green gaze on the concert audience, and spread\r\ndiscomfort as if it were something liquid which he was spraying through\r\na hose. The girls who were nearest looked down flutteringly at their\r\nshoes: those further away concealed themselves behind their neighbors.\r\nEven the duchess, who prided herself on being the possessor of a stare\r\nof unrivalled haughtiness, before which the fresh quailed and those who\r\nmade breaks subsided in confusion, was unable to meet his eyes: and the\r\nwillowy friend of Izzy, for all her victories over that monarch of the\r\nhat-checks, bowed before it like a slim tree before a blizzard.\r\n\r\nOnly Jill returned the manager’s gaze. She was seated on the outer rim\r\nof the semi-circle, and she stared frankly at Mr Goble. She had never\r\nseen anything like him before, and he fascinated her. This behavior on\r\nher part singled her out from the throng, and Mr Goble concentrated his\r\nattention on her.\r\n\r\nFor some seconds he stood looking at her; then, raising a stubby\r\nfinger, he let his eye travel over the company, and seemed to be\r\nengrossed in some sort of mathematical calculation.\r\n\r\n“Thirteen,” he said at length. “I make it thirteen.” He rounded on Mr\r\nPilkington. “I told you we were going to have a chorus of twelve.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington blushed and stumbled over his feet.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes … yes,” he murmured vaguely. “Yes!”\r\n\r\n“Well, there are thirteen here. Count ’em for yourself.” He whipped\r\nround on Jill. “What’s _your_ name? Who engaged you?”\r\n\r\nA croaking sound from the neighborhood of the ceiling indicated the\r\nclearing of Mr Pilkington’s throat.\r\n\r\n“I—er—_I_ engaged Miss Mariner, Mr Goble.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _you_ engaged her?”\r\n\r\nHe stared again at Jill. The inspection was long and lingering, and\r\naffected Jill with a sense of being inadequately clothed. She returned\r\nthe gaze as defiantly as she could, but her heart was beating fast. She\r\nhad never yet beer frightened of any man, but there was something\r\nreptilian about this fat, yellow-haired individual which disquieted\r\nher; much as cockroaches had done in her childhood. A momentary thought\r\nflashed through her mind that it would be horrible to be touched by\r\nhim. He looked soft and glutinous.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Mr Goble at last, after what seemed to Jill many\r\nminutes. He nodded to Mr Saltzburg. “Get on with it! And try working a\r\nlittle this time! I don’t hire you to give musical entertainments.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr Goble, yes. I mean no, Mr Goble!”\r\n\r\n“You can have the Gotham stage this afternoon,” said Mr Goble. “Call\r\nthe rehearsal for two sharp.”\r\n\r\nOutside the door, he turned to Mr Pilkington.\r\n\r\n“That was a fool trick of yours, hiring that girl. Thirteen! I’d as\r\nsoon walk under a ladder on a Friday as open in New York with a chorus\r\nof thirteen. Well, it don’t matter. We can fire one of ’em after we’ve\r\nopened on the road.” He mused for a moment. “Darned pretty girl, that!”\r\nhe went on meditatively. “Where did you get her?”\r\n\r\n“She—ah—came into the office, when you were out. She struck me as being\r\nessentially the type we required for our ensemble, so I—er—engaged her.\r\nShe—” Mr Pilkington gulped. “She is a charming, refined girl!”\r\n\r\n“She’s darned pretty,” admitted Mr Goble, and went on his way wrapped\r\nin thought, Mr Pilkington following timorously. It was episodes like\r\nthe one that had just concluded which made Otis Pilkington wish that he\r\npossessed a little more assertion. He regretted wistfully that he was\r\nnot one of those men who can put their hat on the side of their heads\r\nand shoot out their chins and say to the world “Well, what about it!”\r\nHe was bearing the financial burden of this production. If it should be\r\na failure, his would be the loss. Yet somehow this coarse, rough person\r\nin front of him never seemed to allow him a word in the executive\r\npolicy of the piece. He treated him as a child. He domineered and he\r\nshouted, and behaved as if he were in sole command. Mr Pilkington\r\nsighed. He rather wished he had never gone into this undertaking.\r\n\r\nInside the room, Mr Saltzburg wiped his forehead, spectacles, and his\r\nhands. He had the aspect of one wakes from a dreadful dream.\r\n\r\n“Childrun!” he whispered brokenly. “Childrun! If yoll please, once\r\nmore. Act One, Opening Chorus. Come! La-la-la!”\r\n\r\n“La-la-la!” chanted the subdued members of the ensemble.\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nBy the time the two halves of the company, ensemble and principals,\r\nmelted into one complete whole, the novelty of her new surroundings had\r\nworn off, and Jill was feeling that there had never been a time when\r\nshe had not been one of a theatrical troupe, rehearsing. The pleasant\r\nsocial gatherings round Mr Saltzburg’s piano gave way after a few days\r\nto something far less agreeable and infinitely more strenuous, the\r\nbreaking-in of the dances under the supervision of the famous Johnson\r\nMiller. Johnson Miller was a little man with snow-white hair and the\r\nindia-rubber physique of a juvenile acrobat. Nobody knew actually how\r\nold he was, but he certainly looked much too advanced in years to be\r\ncapable of the feats of endurance which he performed daily. He had the\r\nuntiring enthusiasm of a fox-terrier, and had bullied and scolded more\r\ncompanies along the rocky road that leads to success than any\r\nhalf-dozen dance-directors in the country, in spite of his handicap in\r\nbeing almost completely deaf. He had an almost miraculous gift of\r\npicking up the melodies for which it was his business to design dances,\r\nwithout apparently hearing them. He seemed to absorb them through the\r\npores. He had a blunt and arbitrary manner, and invariably spoke his\r\nmind frankly and honestly—a habit which made him strangely popular in a\r\nprofession where the language of equivoque is cultivated almost as\r\nsedulously as in the circles of international diplomacy. What Johnson\r\nMiller said to your face was official, not subject to revision as soon\r\nas your back was turned: and people appreciated this.\r\n\r\nIzzy’s willowy friend summed him up one evening when the ladies of the\r\nensemble were changing their practise-clothes after a particularly\r\nstrenuous rehearsal, defending him against the Southern girl, who\r\ncomplained that he made her tired.\r\n\r\n“You bet he makes you tired,” she said. “So he does me. I’m losing my\r\ngirlish curves, and I’m so stiff I can’t lace my shoes. But he knows\r\nhis business and he’s on the level, which is more than you can say of\r\nmost of these guys in the show business.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” agreed the Southern girl’s blonde friend. “He does know\r\nhis business. He’s put over any amount of shows which would have\r\nflopped like dogs without him to stage the numbers.”\r\n\r\nThe duchess yawned. Rehearsing always bored her, and she had not been\r\ngreatly impressed by what she had seen of “The Rose of America.”\r\n\r\n“One will be greatly surprised if he can make a success of _this_ show!\r\nI confess I find it perfectly ridiculous.”\r\n\r\n“Ithn’t it the limit, honetht!” said the cherub, arranging her golden\r\nhair at the mirror. “It maketh me thick! Why on earth is Ike putting it\r\non?”\r\n\r\nThe girl who knew everything—there is always one in every\r\ncompany—hastened to explain.\r\n\r\n“I heard all about that. Ike hasn’t any of his own money in the thing.\r\nHe’s getting twenty-five per cent of the show for running it. The angel\r\nis the long fellow you see jumping around. Pilkington his name is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’ll need to be Rockefeller later on,” said the blonde.\r\n\r\n“Oh, they’ll get thomebody down to fixth it after we’ve out on the road\r\na couple of days,” said the cherub, optimistically. “They alwayth do.\r\nI’ve seen worse shows than this turned into hits. All it wants ith a\r\nnew book and lyrics and a different thcore.”\r\n\r\n“And a new set of principals,” said the red-headed Babe. “Did you ever\r\nsee such a bunch?”\r\n\r\nThe duchess, with another tired sigh, arched her well-shaped eyebrows\r\nand studied the effect in the mirror.\r\n\r\n“One wonders where they pick these persons up,” she assented languidly.\r\n“They remind me of a headline I saw in the paper this morning—‘Tons of\r\nHams Unfit for Human Consumption.’ Are any of you girls coming my way?\r\nI can give two or three of you a lift in my limousine.”\r\n\r\n“Thorry, old dear, and thanks ever so much,” said the cherub, “but I\r\ninstructed Clarence, my man, to have the street-car waiting on the\r\ncorner, and he’ll be tho upset if I’m not there.”\r\n\r\nNelly had an engagement to go and help one of the other girls buy a\r\nSpring suit, a solemn rite which it is impossible to conduct by\r\noneself: and Jill and the cherub walked to the corner together. Jill\r\nhad become very fond of the little thing since rehearsals began. She\r\nreminded her of a London sparrow. She was so small and perky and so\r\nabsurdly able to take care of herself.\r\n\r\n“Limouthine!” snorted the cherub. The duchess’ concluding speech\r\nevidently still rankled. “She gives me a pain in the gizthard!”\r\n\r\n“Hasn’t she got a limousine?” asked Jill.\r\n\r\n“Of course she hasn’t. She’s engaged to be married to a demonstrator in\r\nthe Speedwell Auto Company, and he thneaks off when he can get away and\r\ngives her joy-rides. That’s all the limousine she’s got. It beats me\r\nwhy girls in the show business are alwayth tho crazy to make themselves\r\nout vamps with a dozen millionaires on a string. If Mae wouldn’t\r\nfour-flush and act like the Belle of the Moulin Rouge, she’d be the\r\nnithest girl you ever met. She’s mad about the fellow she’s engaged to,\r\nand wouldn’t look at all the millionaires in New York if you brought\r\n’em to her on a tray. She’s going to marry him as thoon as he’s thaved\r\nenough to buy the furniture, and then she’ll thettle down in Harlem\r\nthomewhere and cook and mind the baby and regularly be one of the lower\r\nmiddle classes. All that’s wrong with Mae ith that she’s read Gingery\r\nStories and thinkth that’s the way a girl has to act when she’th in the\r\nchorus.”\r\n\r\n“That’s funny,” said Jill. “I should never have thought it. I swallowed\r\nthe limousine whole.”\r\n\r\nThe cherub looked at her curiously. Jill puzzled her. Jill had, indeed,\r\nbeen the subject of much private speculation among her colleagues.\r\n\r\n“This is your first show, ithn’t it?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Thay, what are you doing in the chorus, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Getting scolded by Mr Miller mostly, it seems to me.”\r\n\r\n“Thcolded by Mr Miller! Why didn’t you say ‘bawled out by Johnny?’\r\nThat’th what any of the retht of us would have said.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve lived most of my life in England. You can’t expect me to\r\ntalk the language yet.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you were English. You’ve got an acthent like the fellow who\r\nplays the dude in thith show. Thay, why did you ever get into the show\r\nbusiness?”\r\n\r\n“Well … well, why did you? Why does anybody?”\r\n\r\n“Why did I? Oh, I belong there. I’m a regular Broadway rat. I wouldn’t\r\nbe happy anywhere elthe. I was born in the show business. I’ve got two\r\nthithters in the two-a-day and a brother in thtock out in California\r\nand dad’s one of the betht comedians on the burlethque wheel. But any\r\none can thee you’re different. There’s no reathon why you should be\r\nbumming around in the chorus.”\r\n\r\n“But there is. I’ve no money, and I can’t do anything to make it.”\r\n\r\n“Honetht?”\r\n\r\n“Honest.”\r\n\r\n“That’s tough.” The cherub pondered, her round eyes searching Jill’s\r\nface. “Why don’t you get married?”\r\n\r\nJill laughed.\r\n\r\n“Nobody’s asked me.”\r\n\r\n“Somebody thoon will. At least, if he’s on the level, and I think he\r\nis. You can generally tell by the look of a guy, and, if you ask me,\r\nfriend Pilkington’s got the license in hith pocket and the ring all\r\nordered and everything.”\r\n\r\n“Pilkington!” cried Jill, aghast.\r\n\r\nShe remembered certain occasions during rehearsals, when, while the\r\nchorus idled in the body of the theatre and listened to the principals\r\nworking at their scenes, the elongated Pilkington had suddenly appeared\r\nin the next seat and conversed sheepishly in a low voice. Could this be\r\nlove? If so, it was a terrible nuisance. Jill had had her experience in\r\nLondon of enamoured young men who, running true to national form,\r\ndeclined to know when they were beaten, and she had not enjoyed the\r\nprocess of cooling their ardor. She had a kind heart, and it distressed\r\nher to give pain. It also got on her nerves to be dogged by stricken\r\nmales who tried to catch her eye in order that she might observe their\r\nbroken condition. She recalled one house-party in Wales where it rained\r\nall the time and she had been cooped up with a victim who kept popping\r\nout from obscure corners and beginning all his pleas with the words “I\r\nsay, you know … !” She trusted that Otis Pilkington was not proposing\r\nto conduct a wooing on those lines. Yet he had certainly developed a\r\nsinister habit of popping out at the theatre. On several occasions he\r\nhad startled her by appearing at her side as if he had come up out of a\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” cried Jill.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yeth!” insisted the cherub, waving imperiously to an approaching\r\nstreet-car. “Well, I must be getting uptown. I’ve got a date. Thee you\r\nlater.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure you’re mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not.”\r\n\r\n“But what makes you think so?”\r\n\r\nThe cherub placed a hand on the rail of the car, preparatory to\r\nswinging herself on board.\r\n\r\n“Well, for one thing,” she said, “he’th been stalking you like an\r\nIndian ever since we left the theatre! Look behind you. Good-bye,\r\nhoney. Thend me a piece of the cake!”\r\n\r\nThe street-car bore her away. The last that Jill saw of her was a wide\r\nand amiable grin. Then, turning, she beheld the snake-like form of Otis\r\nPilkington towering at her side.\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington seemed nervous but determined. His face was half hidden\r\nby the silk scarf that muffled his throat, for he was careful of his\r\nhealth and had a fancied tendency to bronchial trouble. Above the scarf\r\na pair of mild eyes gazed down at Jill through their\r\ntortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles. It was hopeless for Jill to try to\r\ntell herself that the tender gleam behind the glass was not the\r\nlove-light in Otis Pilkington’s eyes. The truth was too obvious.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, Miss Mariner,” said Mr Pilkington, his voice sounding\r\nmuffled and far away through the scarf. “Are you going up-town?”\r\n\r\n“No, down-town,” said Jill quickly.\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Mr Pilkington.\r\n\r\nJill felt annoyed, but helpless. It is difficult to bid a tactful\r\nfarewell to a man who has stated his intention of going in the same\r\ndirection as yourself. There was nothing for it but to accept the\r\nunspoken offer of Otis Pilkington’s escort. They began to walk down\r\nBroadway together.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you are tired after the rehearsal?” enquired Mr Pilkington\r\nin his precise voice. He always spoke as if he were weighing each word\r\nand clipping it off a reel.\r\n\r\n“A little. Mr Miller is very enthusiastic.”\r\n\r\n“About the piece?” Her companion spoke eagerly.\r\n\r\n“No; I meant hard-working.”\r\n\r\n“Has he said anything about the piece?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no. You see, he doesn’t confide in us a great deal, except to\r\ntell us his opinion of the way we do the steps. I don’t think we\r\nimpress him very much, to judge from what he says. But the girls say he\r\nalways tells every chorus he rehearses that it is the worst he ever had\r\nanything to do with.”\r\n\r\n“And the chor—the—er—ladies of the ensemble? What do they think of the\r\npiece?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t suppose they are very good judges, are they?” said Jill\r\ndiplomatically.\r\n\r\n“You mean they do not like it?”\r\n\r\n“Some of them don’t seem quite to understand it.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n“I am beginning to wonder myself whether it may not be a little over\r\nthe heads of the public,” he said ruefully. “When it was first\r\nperformed …”\r\n\r\n“Oh, has it been done before?”\r\n\r\n“By amateurs, yes, at the house of my aunt, Mrs Waddesleigh Peagrim, at\r\nNewport, last Summer. In aid of the Armenian orphans. It was\r\nextraordinarily well received on that occasion. We nearly made our\r\nexpenses. It was such a success that—I feel I can confide in you. I\r\nshould not like this repeated to your—your—the other ladies—it was such\r\na success that, against my aunt’s advice, I decided to give it a\r\nBroadway production. Between ourselves, I am shouldering practically\r\nall the expenses of the undertaking. Mr Goble has nothing to do with\r\nthe financial arrangements of ‘The Rose of America.’ Those are entirely\r\nin my hands. Mr Goble, in return for a share in the profits, is giving\r\nus the benefit of his experience as regards the management and booking\r\nof the piece. I have always had the greatest faith in it. Trevis and I\r\nwrote it when we were in college together, and all our friends thought\r\nit exceptionally brilliant. My aunt, as I say, was opposed to the\r\nventure. She holds the view that I am not a good man of business. In a\r\nsense, perhaps, she is right. Temperamentally, no doubt, I am more the\r\nartist. But I was determined to show the public something superior to\r\nthe so-called Broadway successes, which are so terribly trashy.\r\nUnfortunately, I am beginning to wonder whether it is possible, with\r\nthe crude type of actor at one’s disposal in this country, to give a\r\nreally adequate performance of such a play as ‘The Rose of America.’\r\nThese people seem to miss the spirit of the piece, its subtle\r\ntopsy-turvy humor, its delicate whimsicality. This afternoon,” Mr\r\nPilkington choked. “This afternoon I happened to overhear two of the\r\nprincipals, who were not aware that I was within earshot, discussing\r\nthe play. One of them—these people express themselves curiously—one of\r\nthem said that he thought it a quince: and the other described it as a\r\npiece of gorgonzola cheese! That is not the spirit that wins success!”\r\n\r\nJill was feeling immensely relieved. After all, it seemed, this poor\r\nyoung man merely wanted sympathy, not romance. She had been mistaken,\r\nshe felt, about that gleam in his eyes. It was not the love-light: it\r\nwas the light of panic. He was the author of the play. He had sunk a\r\nlarge sum of money in its production, he had heard people criticizing\r\nit harshly, and he was suffering from what her colleagues in the chorus\r\nwould have called cold feet. It was such a human emotion and he seemed\r\nso like an overgrown child pleading to be comforted that her heart\r\nwarmed to him. Relief melted her defences. And when, on their arrival\r\nat Thirty-fourth Street Mr Pilkington suggested that she partake of a\r\ncup of tea at his apartment, which was only a couple of blocks away off\r\nMadison Avenue, she accepted the invitation without hesitating.\r\n\r\nOn the way to his apartment Mr Pilkington continued in the minor key.\r\nHe was a great deal more communicative than she herself would have been\r\nto such a comparative stranger as she was, but she knew that men were\r\noften like this. Over in London, she had frequently been made the\r\nrecipient of the most intimate confidences by young men whom she had\r\nmet for the first time the same evening at a dance. She had been forced\r\nto believe that there was something about her personality that acted on\r\na certain type of man like the crack in the dam, setting loose the\r\nsurging flood of their eloquence. To this class Otis Pilkington\r\nevidently belonged: for, once started, he withheld nothing.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t that I’m dependent on Aunt Olive or anything like that,” he\r\nvouchsafed, as he stirred the tea in his Japanese-print hung studio.\r\n“But you know how it is. Aunt Olive is in a position to make it very\r\nunpleasant for me if I do anything foolish. At present, I have reason\r\nto know that she intends to leave me practically all that she\r\npossesses. Millions!” said Mr Pilkington, handing Jill a cup. “I assure\r\nyou, millions! But there is a hard commercial strain in her. It would\r\nhave the most prejudicial effect upon her if, especially after she had\r\nexpressly warned me against it, I were to lose a great deal of money\r\nover this production. She is always complaining that I am not a\r\nbusiness man like my late uncle. Mr Waddesleigh Peagrim made a fortune\r\nin smoked hams.” Mr Pilkington looked at the Japanese prints, and\r\nshuddered slightly. “Right up to the time of his death he was urging me\r\nto go into the business. I could not have endured it. But, when I heard\r\nthose two men discussing the play, I almost wished that I had done so.”\r\n\r\nJill was now completely disarmed. She would almost have patted this\r\nunfortunate young man’s head, if she could have reached it.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t worry about the piece,” she said. “I’ve read somewhere or\r\nheard somewhere that it’s the surest sign of a success when actors\r\ndon’t like a play.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington drew his chair an imperceptible inch nearer.\r\n\r\n“How sympathetic you are!”\r\n\r\nJill perceived with chagrin that she had been mistaken after all. It\r\n_was_ the love-light. The tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles sprayed it\r\nall over her like a couple of searchlights. Otis Pilkington was looking\r\nexactly like a sheep, and she knew from past experience that that was\r\nthe infallible sign. When young men looked like that, it was time to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I must be off,” she said. “Thank you so much for giving me\r\ntea. I shouldn’t be a bit afraid about the play. I’m sure it’s going to\r\nbe splendid. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“You aren’t going already?”\r\n\r\n“I must. I’m very late as it is. I promised …”\r\n\r\nWhatever fiction Jill might have invented to the detriment of her soul\r\nwas interrupted by a ring at the bell. The steps of Mr Pilkington’s\r\nJapanese servant crossing the hall came faintly to the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n“Mr Pilkington in?”\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington motioned pleadingly to Jill.\r\n\r\n“Don’t go!” he urged. “It’s only a man I know. He has probably come to\r\nremind me that I am dining with him tonight. He won’t stay a minute.\r\nPlease don’t go.”\r\n\r\nJill sat down. She had no intention of going now. The cheery voice at\r\nthe front door had been the cheery voice of her long-lost uncle, Major\r\nChristopher Selby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris walked breezily into the room, flicking a jaunty glove. He\r\nstopped short on seeing that Mr Pilkington was not alone.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I beg your pardon! I understood …” He peered at Jill uncertainly.\r\nMr Pilkington affected a dim, artistic lighting-system in his studio,\r\nand people who entered from the great outdoors generally had to take\r\ntime to accustom their eyes to it. “If you’re engaged …”\r\n\r\n“Er—allow me … Miss Mariner … Major Selby.”\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Uncle Chris!” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“God bless my soul!” ejaculated that startled gentleman adventurer, and\r\ncollapsed onto a settee as if his legs had been mown from under him.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been looking for you all over New York,” said Jill.\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington found himself unequal to the intellectual pressure of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Chris?” he said with a note of feeble enquiry in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Major Selby is my uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?” said Mr Pilkington. “I mean …”\r\n\r\nNot being able to ascertain, after a moment’s self-examination, what he\r\ndid mean, he relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n“Whatever are you doing here?” asked Uncle Chris.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been having tea with Mr Pilkington.”\r\n\r\n“But … but why Mr Pilkington?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he invited me.”\r\n\r\n“But how do you know him?”\r\n\r\n“We met at the theatre.”\r\n\r\n“Theatre?”\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington recovered his power of speech.\r\n\r\n“Miss Mariner is rehearsing with a little play in which I am\r\ninterested,” he explained.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris half rose from the settee. He blinked twice in rapid\r\nsuccession. Jill had never seen him so shaken from his customary poise.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me you have gone on the stage, Jill!”\r\n\r\n“I have. I’m in the chorus …”\r\n\r\n“Ensemble,” corrected Mr Pilkington softly.\r\n\r\n“I’m in the ensemble of a piece called ‘The Rose of America.’ We’ve\r\nbeen rehearsing for ever so long.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris digested this information in silence for a moment. He\r\npulled at his short mustache.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course!” he said at length. Jill, who know him so well, could\r\ntell by the restored ring of cheeriness in his tone that he was himself\r\nagain. He had dealt with this situation in his mind and was prepared to\r\ncope with it. The surmise was confirmed the next instant when he rose\r\nand stationed himself in front of the fire. Mr Pilkington detested\r\nsteam-heat and had scoured the city till he had found a studio\r\napartment with an open fireplace. Uncle Chris spread his legs and\r\nexpanded his chest. “Of course,” he said. “I remember now that you told\r\nme in your letter that you were thinking of going on the stage. My\r\nniece,” explained Uncle Chris to the attentive Mr Pilkington, “came\r\nover from England on a later boat. I was not expecting her for some\r\nweeks. Hence my surprise at meeting her here. Of course. You told me\r\nthat you intended to go on the stage, and I strongly recommended you to\r\nbegin at the bottom of the ladder and learn the ground-work thoroughly\r\nbefore you attempted higher flights.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that was it?” said Mr Pilkington. He had been wondering.\r\n\r\n“There is no finer training,” resumed Uncle Chris, completely at his\r\nease once more, “than the chorus. How many of the best-known actresses\r\nin America began in that way! Dozens. Dozens. If I were giving advice\r\nto any young girl with theatrical aspirations, I should say ‘Begin in\r\nthe chorus!’ On the other hand,” he proceeded, turning to Pilkington,\r\n“I think it would be just as well if you would not mention the fact of\r\nmy niece being in that position to Mrs Waddesleigh Peagrim. She might\r\nnot understand.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” assented Mr Pilkington.\r\n\r\n“The term ‘chorus’…”\r\n\r\n“I dislike it intensely myself.”\r\n\r\n“It suggests …”\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris inflated his chest again, well satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Capital!” he said. “Well, I only dropped in to remind you, my boy,\r\nthat you and your aunt are dining with me tonight. I was afraid a busy\r\nman like you might forget.”\r\n\r\n“I was looking forward to it,” said Mr Pilkington, charmed at the\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n“You remember the address? Nine East Forty-First Street. I have moved,\r\nyou remember.”\r\n\r\n“So that was why I couldn’t find you at the other place,” said Jill.\r\n“The man at the door said he had never heard of you.”\r\n\r\n“Stupid idiot!” said Uncle Chris testily. “These New York hall-porters\r\nare recruited entirely from homes for the feeble-minded. I suppose he\r\nwas a new man. Well, Pilkington, my boy, I shall expect you at seven\r\no’clock. Goodbye till then. Come, Jill.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Mr Pilkington,” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye for the present, Miss Mariner,” said Mr Pilkington, bending\r\ndown to take her hand. The tortoiseshell spectacles shot a last soft\r\nbeam at her.\r\n\r\nAs the front door closed behind them, Uncle Chris heaved a sigh of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n“Whew! I think I handled that little contretemps with diplomacy! A\r\ncertain amount of diplomacy, I think!”\r\n\r\n“If you mean,” said Jill severely, “that you told some disgraceful fibs\r\n…”\r\n\r\n“Fibs, my dear,—or shall we say, artistic mouldings of the unshapely\r\nclay of truth—are the … how shall I put it?… Well, anyway, they come in\r\ndashed handy. It would never have done for Mrs Peagrim to have found\r\nout that you were in the chorus. If she discovered that my niece was in\r\nthe chorus, she would infallibly suspect me of being an adventurer. And\r\nwhile,” said Uncle Chris meditatively, “of course I _am_, it is nice to\r\nhave one’s little secrets. The good lady has had a rooted distaste for\r\ngirls in that perfectly honorable but maligned profession ever since\r\nour long young friend back there was sued for breach of promise by a\r\nmember of a touring company in his sophomore year at college. We all\r\nhave our prejudices. That is hers. However, I think we may rely on our\r\nfriend to say nothing about the matter … But why did you do it? My dear\r\nchild, whatever induced you to take such a step?”\r\n\r\nJill laughed.\r\n\r\n“That’s practically what Mr Miller said to me when we were rehearsing\r\none of the dances this afternoon, only he put it differently.” She\r\nlinked her arm in his. “What else could I do? I was alone in New York\r\nwith the remains of that twenty dollars you sent me and no more in\r\nsight.”\r\n\r\n“But why didn’t you stay down at Brookport with your Uncle Elmer?”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever seen my Uncle Elmer?”\r\n\r\n“No. Curiously enough, I never have.”\r\n\r\n“If you had, you wouldn’t ask. Brookport! Ugh! I left when they tried\r\nto get me to understudy the hired man, who had resigned.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they got tired of supporting me in the state to which I was\r\naccustomed—I don’t blame them!—so they began to find ways of making me\r\nuseful about the home. I didn’t mind reading to Aunt Julia, and I could\r\njust stand taking Tibby for walks. But, when it came to shoveling snow,\r\nI softly and silently vanished away.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t understand all this. I suggested to your\r\nuncle—diplomatically—that you had large private means.”\r\n\r\n“I know you did. And he spent all his time showing me over houses and\r\ntelling me I could have them for a hundred thousand dollars cash down.”\r\nJill bubbled. “You should have seen his face when I told him that\r\ntwenty dollars was all I had in the world!”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t tell him that!”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris shook his head, like an indulgent father disappointed in a\r\nfavorite child.\r\n\r\n“You’re a dear girl, Jill, but really you do seem totally lacking in …\r\nhow shall I put it?—finesse. Your mother was just the same. A sweet\r\nwoman, but with no diplomacy, no notion of _handling_ a situation. I\r\nremember her as a child giving me away hopelessly on one occasion after\r\nwe had been at the jam-cupboard. She did not mean any harm, but she was\r\nconstitutionally incapable of a tactful negative at the right time.”\r\nUncle Chris brooded for a moment on the past. “Oh, well, it’s a very\r\nfine trait, no doubt, though inconvenient. I don’t blame you for\r\nleaving Brookport if you weren’t happy there. But I wish you had\r\nconsulted me before going on the stage.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I strike this man?” asked Jill of the world at large. “How could\r\nI consult you? My darling, precious uncle, don’t you realize that you\r\nhad vanished into thin air, leaving me penniless? I had to do\r\nsomething. And, now that we are on the subject, perhaps you will\r\nexplain your movements. Why did you write to me from that place on\r\nFifty-Seventh Street if you weren’t there?”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“In a sense … when I wrote … I was there.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that means something, but it’s beyond me. I’m not nearly as\r\nintelligent as you think, Uncle Chris, so you’ll have to explain.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was this way, my dear. I was in a peculiar position you must\r\nremember. I had made a number of wealthy friends on the boat and it is\r\npossible that—unwittingly—I gave them the impression that I was as\r\ncomfortably off as themselves. At any rate, that is the impression they\r\ngathered, and it hardly seemed expedient to correct it. For it is a\r\ndeplorable trait in the character of the majority of rich people that\r\nthey only—er—expand,—they only show the best and most companionable\r\nside of themselves to those whom they imagine to be as wealthy as they\r\nare. Well, of course, while one was on the boat, the fact that I was\r\nsailing under what a purist might have termed false colors did not\r\nmatter. The problem was how to keep up the—er—innocent deception after\r\nwe had reached New York. A woman like Mrs Waddesleigh Peagrim—a ghastly\r\ncreature, my dear, all front teeth and exuberance, but richer than the\r\nSub-Treasury—looks askance at a man, however agreeable, if he endeavors\r\nto cement a friendship begun on board ship from a cheap boarding-house\r\non Amsterdam Avenue. It was imperative that I should find something in\r\nthe nature of what I might call a suitable base of operations. Fortune\r\nplayed into my hands. One of the first men I met in New York was an old\r\nsoldier-servant of mine, to whom I had been able to do some kindnesses\r\nin the old days. In fact—it shows how bread cast upon the waters\r\nreturns to us after many days—it was with the assistance of a small\r\nloan from me that he was enabled to emigrate to America. Well, I met\r\nthis man, and, after a short conversation, he revealed the fact that he\r\nwas the hall-porter at that apartment-house which you visited, the one\r\non Fifty-Seventh Street. At this time of the year, I knew, many wealthy\r\npeople go south, to Florida and the Carolinas, and it occurred to me\r\nthat there might be a vacant apartment in his building. There was. I\r\ntook it.”\r\n\r\n“But how on earth could you afford to pay for an apartment in a place\r\nlike that?”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris coughed.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say I paid for it. I said I took it. That is, as one might\r\nsay, the point of my story. My old friend, grateful for favors received\r\nand wishing to do me a good turn consented to become my accomplice in\r\nanother—er—innocent deception. I gave my friends the address and\r\ntelephone number of the apartment-house, living the while myself in\r\nsurroundings of a somewhat humbler and less expensive character. I\r\ncalled every morning for letters. If anybody rang me up on the\r\ntelephone, the admirable man answered in the capacity of my servant,\r\ntook a message, and relayed it on to me at my boarding-house. If\r\nanybody called, he merely said that I was out. There wasn’t a flaw in\r\nthe whole scheme, my dear, and its chief merit was its beautiful\r\nsimplicity.”\r\n\r\n“Then what made you give it up? Conscience?”\r\n\r\n“Conscience never made me give up _anything_,” said Uncle Chris firmly.\r\n“No, there were a hundred chances to one against anything going wrong,\r\nand it was the hundredth that happened. When you have been in New York\r\nlonger, you will realize that one peculiarity of the place is that the\r\nworking-classes are in a constant state of flux. On Monday you meet a\r\nplumber. Ah! you say, A plumber! Capital! On the following Thursday you\r\nmeet him again, and he is a car-conductor. Next week he will be\r\nsquirting soda in a drug-store. It’s the fault of these dashed\r\nmagazines, with their advertisements of correspondence courses—Are You\r\nEarning All You Should?—Write To Us and Learn Chicken-Farming By Mail …\r\nIt puts wrong ideas into the fellows’ heads. It unsettles them. It was\r\nso in this case. Everything was going swimmingly, when my man suddenly\r\nconceived the idea that destiny had intended him for a\r\nchauffeur-gardener, and he threw up his position!”\r\n\r\n“Leaving you homeless!”\r\n\r\n“As you say, homeless—temporarily. But, fortunately,—I have been\r\namazingly lucky all through; it really does seem as if you cannot keep\r\na good man down—fortunately my friend had a friend who was janitor at a\r\nplace on East Forty-First Street, and by a miracle of luck the only\r\napartment in the building was empty. It is an office-building, but,\r\nlike some of these places, it has one small bachelor’s apartment on the\r\ntop floor.”\r\n\r\n“And you are the small bachelor?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. My friend explained matters to his friend—a few financial\r\ndetails were satisfactorily arranged—and here I am, perfectly happy\r\nwith the cosiest little place in the world, rent free. I am even better\r\noff than I was before, as a matter of fact, for my new ally’s wife is\r\nan excellent cook, and I have been enabled to give one or two very\r\npleasant dinners at my new home. It lends verisimilitude to the thing\r\nif you can entertain a little. If you are never in when people call,\r\nthey begin to wonder. I am giving dinner to your friend Pilkington and\r\nMrs Peagrim there tonight. Homey, delightful, and infinitely cheaper\r\nthan a restaurant.”\r\n\r\n“And what will you do when the real owner of the place walks in in the\r\nmiddle of dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Out of the question. The janitor informs me that he left for England\r\nsome weeks ago, intending to make a stay of several months.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you certainly think of everything.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever success I may have achieved,” replied Uncle Chris, with the\r\ndignity of a Captain of Industry confiding in an interviewer, “I\r\nattribute to always thinking of everything.”\r\n\r\nJill gurgled with laughter. There was that about her uncle which always\r\nacted on her moral sense like an opiate, lulling it to sleep and\r\npreventing it from rising up and becoming critical. If he had stolen a\r\nwatch and chain, he would somehow have succeeded in convincing her that\r\nhe had acted for the best under the dictates of a benevolent altruism.\r\n\r\n“What success _have_ you achieved?” she asked, interested. “When you\r\nleft me, you were on your way to find a fortune. Did you find it?”\r\n\r\n“I have not actually placed my hands upon it yet,” admitted Uncle\r\nChris. “But it is hovering in the air all round me. I can hear the\r\nbeating of the wings of the dollar-bills as they flutter to and fro,\r\nalmost within reach. Sooner or later I shall grab them. I never forget,\r\nmy dear, that I have a task before me,—to restore to you the money of\r\nwhich I deprived you. Some day—be sure—I shall do it. Some day you will\r\nreceive a letter from me, containing a large sum—five thousand—ten\r\nthousand—twenty thousand—whatever it may be, with the simple words\r\n‘First Instalment’.” He repeated the phrase, as if it pleased him.\r\n“First Instalment!”\r\n\r\nJill hugged his arm. She was in the mood in which she used to listen to\r\nhim ages ago telling her fairy stories.\r\n\r\n“Go on!” she cried. “Go on! It’s wonderful! Once upon a time Uncle\r\nChris was walking along Fifth Avenue, when he happened to meet a poor\r\nold woman gathering sticks for firewood. She looked so old and tired\r\nthat he was sorry for her, so he gave her ten cents which he had\r\nborrowed from the janitor, and suddenly she turned into a beautiful\r\ngirl and said ‘I am a fairy! In return for your kindness I grant you\r\nthree wishes!’ And Uncle Chris thought for a moment, and said, ‘I want\r\ntwenty thousand dollars to send to Jill!’ And the fairy said, ‘It shall\r\nbe attended to. And the next article?’”\r\n\r\n“It is all very well to joke,” protested Uncle Chris, pained by this\r\nflippancy, “but let me tell you that I shall not require magic\r\nassistance to become a rich man. Do you realize that at houses like Mrs\r\nWaddesleigh Peagrim’s I am meeting men all the time who have only to\r\nsay one little word to make me a millionaire? They are fat, gray men\r\nwith fishy eyes and large waistcoats, and they sit smoking cigars and\r\nbrooding on what they are going to do to the market next day. If I were\r\na mind-reader I could have made a dozen fortunes by now. I sat opposite\r\nthat old pirate, Bruce Bishop, for over an hour the very day before he\r\nand his gang sent Consolidated Pea-Nuts down twenty points! If I had\r\nknown what was in the wind, I doubt if I could have restrained myself\r\nfrom choking his intentions out of the fellow. Well, what I am trying\r\nto point out is that one of these days one of these old oysters will\r\nhave a fleeting moment of human pity and disgorge some tip on which I\r\ncan act. It is that reflection that keeps me so constantly at Mrs\r\nPeagrim’s house.” Uncle Chris shivered slightly. “A fearsome woman, my\r\ndear! Weighs a hundred and eighty pounds and as skittish as a young\r\nlamb in springtime! She makes me dance with her!” Uncle Chris’ lips\r\nquivered in a spasm of pain, and he was silent for a moment. “Thank\r\nheaven I was once a footballer!” he said reverently.\r\n\r\n“But what do you live on?” asked Jill. “I know you are going to be a\r\nmillionaire next Tuesday week, but how are you getting along in the\r\nmeantime?”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris coughed.\r\n\r\n“Well, as regards actual living expenses, I have managed by a shrewd\r\nbusiness stroke to acquire a small but sufficient income. I live in a\r\nboarding-house—true—but I contrive to keep the wolf away from its\r\ndoor,—which, by the by, badly needs a lick of paint. Have you ever\r\nheard of Nervino?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so. It sounds like a patent medicine.”\r\n\r\n“It is a patent medicine.” Uncle Chris stopped and looked anxiously at\r\nher. “Jill, you’re looking pale, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“Am I? We had rather a tiring rehearsal.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure,” said Uncle Chris seriously, “that it is only that? Are\r\nyou sure that your vitality has not become generally lowered by the\r\nfierce rush of metropolitan life? Are you aware of the things that can\r\nhappen to you if you allow the red corpuscles of your blood to become\r\ndevitalised? I had a friend …”\r\n\r\n“Stop! You’re scaring me to death!”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris gave his mustache a satisfied twirl. “Just what I meant to\r\ndo, my dear. And, when I had scared you sufficiently—you wouldn’t wait\r\nfor the story of my consumptive friend! Pity! It’s one of my best!—I\r\nshould have mentioned that I had been having much the same trouble\r\nmyself until lately, but the other day I happened to try Nervino, the\r\ngreat specific … I was giving you an illustration of myself in action,\r\nmy dear. I went to these Nervino people—happened to see one of their\r\nposters and got the idea in a flash—I went to them and said, ‘Here am\r\nI, a presentable man of persuasive manners and a large acquaintance\r\namong the leaders of New York Society. What would it be worth to you to\r\nhave me hint from time to time at dinner parties and so forth that\r\nNervino is the rich man’s panacea?’ I put the thing lucidly to them. I\r\nsaid, ‘No doubt you have a thousand agents in the city, but have you\r\none who does not look like an agent and won’t talk like an agent? Have\r\nyou one who is inside the houses of the wealthy, at their very\r\ndinner-tables, instead of being on the front step, trying to hold the\r\ndoor open with his foot? That is the point you have to consider.’ They\r\nsaw the idea at once. We arranged terms—not as generous as I could\r\nwish, perhaps, but quite ample. I receive a tolerably satisfactory\r\nsalary each week, and in return I spread the good word about Nervino in\r\nthe gilded palaces of the rich. Those are the people to go for, Jill.\r\nThey have been so busy wrenching money away from the widow and the\r\norphan that they haven’t had time to look after their health. You catch\r\none of them after dinner, just as he is wondering if he was really wise\r\nin taking two helpings of the lobster Newburg, and he is clay in your\r\nhands. I draw my chair up to his and become sympathetic and say that I\r\nhad precisely the same trouble myself until recently and mention a dear\r\nold friend of mine who died of indigestion, and gradually lead the\r\nconversation round to Nervino. I don’t force it on them. I don’t even\r\nask them to try it. I merely point to myself, rosy with health, and say\r\nthat I owe everything to it, and the thing is done. They thank me\r\nprofusely and scribble the name down on their shirt-cuffs. And there\r\nyour are! I don’t suppose,” said Uncle Chris philosophically, “that the\r\nstuff can do them any actual harm.”\r\n\r\nThey had come to the corner of Forty-first Street. Uncle Chris felt in\r\nhis pocket and produced a key.\r\n\r\n“If you want to go and take a look at my little nest, you can let\r\nyourself in. It’s on the twenty-second floor. Don’t fail to go out on\r\nthe roof and look at the view. It’s worth seeing. It will give you some\r\nidea of the size of the city. A wonderful, amazing city, my dear, full\r\nof people who need Nervino. I shall go on and drop in at the club for\r\nhalf an hour. They have given me a fortnight’s card at the Avenue.\r\nCapital place. Here’s the key.”\r\n\r\nJill turned down Forty-first Street, and came to a mammoth structure of\r\nsteel and stone which dwarfed the modest brown houses beside it into\r\nnothingness. It was curious to think of a private apartment nestling on\r\nthe summit of this mountain. She went in, and the elevator shot her\r\ngiddily upwards to the twenty-second floor. She found herself facing a\r\nshort flight of stone steps, ending in a door. She mounted the steps,\r\ntried the key, and, turning it, entered a hall-way. Proceeding down the\r\npassage, she reached a sitting-room.\r\n\r\nIt was a small room, but furnished with a solid comfort which soothed\r\nher. For the first time since she had arrived in New York, she had the\r\nsense of being miles away from the noise and bustle of the city. There\r\nwas a complete and restful silence. She was alone in a nest of books\r\nand deep chairs, on which a large grandfather-clock looked down with\r\nthat wide-faced benevolence peculiar to its kind. So peaceful was this\r\neyrie, perched high up above the clamor and rattle of civilization,\r\nthat every nerve in her body seemed to relax in a delicious content. It\r\nwas like being in Peter Pan’s house in the tree-tops.\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nJill possessed in an unusual degree that instinct for exploration which\r\nis implanted in most of us. She was frankly inquisitive, and could\r\nnever be two minutes in a strange room without making a tour of it and\r\nexamining its books, pictures, and photographs. Almost at once she\r\nbegan to prowl.\r\n\r\nThe mantelpiece was her first objective. She always made for other\r\npeople’s mantelpieces, for there, more than anywhere else, is the\r\ncharacter of a proprietor revealed. This mantelpiece was sprinkled with\r\nphotographs, large, small, framed and unframed. In the center of it,\r\nstanding all alone and looking curiously out of place among its large\r\nneighbors, was a little snapshot.\r\n\r\nIt was dark by the mantelpiece. Jill took the photograph, to the\r\nwindow, where the fading light could fall on it. Why, she could not\r\nhave said, but the thing interested her. There was mystery about it. It\r\nseemed in itself so insignificant to have the place of honor.\r\n\r\nThe snapshot had evidently been taken by an amateur, but it was one of\r\nthose lucky successes which happen at rare intervals to amateur\r\nphotographers to encourage them to proceed with their hobby. It showed\r\na small girl in a white dress cut short above slim, black legs,\r\nstanding in the porch of an old house, one hand swinging a sunbonnet,\r\nthe other patting an Irish terrier which had planted its front paws\r\nagainst her waist and was looking up into her face with that grave\r\nmelancholy characteristic of Irish terriers. The sunlight was evidently\r\nstrong, for the child’s face was puckered in a twisted though engaging\r\ngrin. Jill’s first thought was “What a jolly kid!” And then, with a\r\nleaping of the heart that seemed to send something big and choking into\r\nher throat, she saw that it was a photograph of herself.\r\n\r\nWith a swooping bound memory raced back over the years. She could feel\r\nthe hot sun on her face, hear the anxious voice of Freddie Rooke—then\r\nfourteen and for the first time the owner of a camera—imploring her to\r\nstand just like that because he wouldn’t be half a minute only some\r\nrotten thing had stuck or something. Then the sharp click, the doubtful\r\nassurance of Freddie that he thought it was all right if he hadn’t\r\nforgotten to shift the film (in which case she might expect to appear\r\nin combination with a cow which he had snapped on his way to the\r\nhouse), and the relieved disappearance of Pat, the terrier, who didn’t\r\nunderstand photography. How many years ago had that been? She could not\r\nremember. But Freddie had grown to long-legged manhood, she to an age\r\nof discretion and full-length frocks, Pat had died, the old house was\r\ninhabited by strangers … and here was the silent record of that sun-lit\r\nafternoon, three thousand miles away from the English garden in which\r\nit had come into existence.\r\n\r\nThe shadows deepened. The top of the great building swayed gently,\r\ncausing the pendulum of the grandfather-clock to knock against the\r\nsides of its wooden case. Jill started. The noise, coming after the\r\ndead silence, frightened her till she realized what it was. She had a\r\nnervous feeling of not being alone. It was as if the shadows held\r\ngoblins that peered out at the intruder. She darted to the mantelpiece\r\nand replaced the photograph. She felt like some heroine of a\r\nfairy-story meddling with the contents of the giant’s castle. Soon\r\nthere would come the sound of a great footstep, thud—thud …\r\n\r\n_Thud._\r\n\r\nJill’s heart gave another leap. She was perfectly sure she had heard a\r\nsound. It had been just like the banging of a door. She braced herself,\r\nlistening, every muscle tense. And then, cleaving the stillness, came a\r\nvoice from down the passage—\r\n\r\n“Just see them Pullman porters,\r\nDolled up with scented waters\r\nBought with their dimes and quarters!\r\n    See, here they come! Here they come!”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor an instant Jill could not have said whether she was relieved or\r\nmore frightened than ever. True, that numbing sense of the uncanny had\r\nceased to grip her, for Reason told her that spectres do not sing\r\nrag-time songs. On the other hand, owners of apartments do, and she\r\nwould almost as readily have faced a spectre as the owner of this\r\napartment. Dizzily, she wandered how in the world she was to explain\r\nher presence. Suppose he turned out to be some awful, choleric person\r\nwho would listen to no explanations.\r\n\r\n“Oh, see those starched-up collars!\r\nHark how their captain hollers\r\n        ‘Keep time! Keep time!’\r\nIt’s worth a thousand dollars\r\nTo see those tip-collectors …”\r\n\r\n\r\nVery near now. Almost at the door.\r\n\r\n“Those upper-berth inspectors,\r\nThose Pullman porters on parade!”\r\n\r\n\r\nA dim, shapeless figure in the black of the doorway, scrabbling of\r\nfingers on the wall.\r\n\r\n“Where are you, dammit?” said the voice, apparently addressing the\r\nelectric-light switch.\r\n\r\nJill shrank back, desperate fingers pressing deep into the back of an\r\narm-chair. Light flashed from the wall at her side. And there, in the\r\ndoorway, stood Wally Mason in his shirt-sleeves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nIn these days of rapid movement, when existence has become little more\r\nthan a series of shocks of varying intensity, astonishment is the\r\nshortest-lived of all the emotions. The human brain has trained itself\r\nto elasticity and recovers its balance in the presence of the\r\nunforeseen with a speed almost miraculous. The man who says ‘I _am_\r\nsurprised!’ really means ‘I _was_ surprised a moment ago, but now I\r\nhave adjusted myself to the situation.’ There was an instant in which\r\nJill looked at Wally and Wally at Jill with the eye of total amazement,\r\nand then, almost simultaneously, each began—the process was\r\nsub-conscious—to regard this meeting not as an isolated and\r\ninexplicable event, but as something resulting from a perfectly logical\r\nchain of circumstances. Jill perceived that the presence in the\r\napartment of that snap-shot of herself should have prepared her for the\r\ndiscovery that the place belonged to someone who had known her as a\r\nchild, and that there was no reason for her to be stunned by the fact\r\nthat this someone was Wally Mason. Wally, on his side, knew that Jill\r\nwas in New York; and had already decided, erroneously, that she had\r\nfound his address in the telephone directory and was paying an ordinary\r\ncall. It was, perhaps, a little unusual that she should have got into\r\nthe place without ringing the front door bell and that she should be in\r\nhis sitting-room in the dark, but these were minor aspects of the\r\nmatter. To the main fact, that here she was, he had adjusted his mind,\r\nand, while there was surprise in his voice when he finally spoke, it\r\nwas not the surprise of one who suspects himself of seeing visions.\r\n\r\n“Hello!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said Jill.\r\n\r\nIt was not a very exalted note on which to pitch the conversation, but\r\nit had the merit of giving each of them a little more time to collect\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“This is … I wasn’t expecting you!” said Wally.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t expecting _you!_” said Jill.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause, in which Wally, apparently examining her last\r\nwords and turning them over in his mind found that they did not square\r\nwith his preconceived theories.\r\n\r\n“You weren’t expecting me?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly was not!”\r\n\r\n“But … but you knew I lived here?”\r\n\r\nJill shook her head. Wally reflected for an instant, and then put his\r\nfinger, with a happy inspiration, on the very heart of the mystery.\r\n\r\n“Then how on earth did you get here?”\r\n\r\nHe was glad he had asked that. The sense of unreality which had come to\r\nhim in the first startling moment of seeing her and vanished under the\r\ninfluence of logic had returned as strong as ever. If she did not know\r\nhe lived in this place, how in the name of everything uncanny had she\r\nfound her way here? A momentary wonder as to whether all this was not\r\nmixed up with telepathy and mental suggestion and all that sort of\r\nthing came to him. Certainly he had been thinking of her all the time\r\nsince their parting at the Savoy Hotel that night three weeks and more\r\nback … No, that was absurd. There must be some sounder reason for her\r\npresence. He waited for her to give it.\r\n\r\nJill for the moment felt physically incapable of giving it. She shrank\r\nfrom the interminable explanation which confronted her as a weary\r\ntraveller shrinks from a dusty, far-stretching desert. She simply could\r\nnot go into all that now. So she answered with a question.\r\n\r\n“When did you land in New York?”\r\n\r\n“This afternoon. We were supposed to dock this morning, but the boat\r\nwas late.” Wally perceived that he was pushed away from the main point,\r\nand jostled his way to it. “But what are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“It’s such a long story.”\r\n\r\nHer voice was plaintive. Remorse smote Wally. It occurred to him that\r\nhe had not been sufficiently sympathetic. Not a word had he said on the\r\nsubject of her change of fortunes. He had just stood and gaped and\r\nasked questions. After all, what the devil did it matter how she came\r\nto be here? He had anticipated a long and tedious search for her\r\nthrough the labyrinth of New York, and here Fate had brought her to his\r\nvery door, and all he could do was to ask why, instead of being\r\nthankful. He perceived that he was not much of a fellow.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” he said. “You can tell me what you feel like it.” He\r\nlooked at her eagerly. Time seemed to have wiped away that little\r\nmisunderstanding under the burden of which they had parted. “It’s too\r\nwonderful finding you like this!” He hesitated. “I heard\r\nabout—everything,” he said awkwardly.\r\n\r\n“My—” Jill hesitated too. “My smash?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Freddie Rooke told me. I was terribly sorry.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Jill.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. They were both thinking of that other disaster which\r\nhad happened. The presence of Derek Underhill seemed to stand like an\r\nunseen phantom between them. Finally Wally spoke at random, choosing\r\nthe first words that came into his head in his desire to break the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“Jolly place, this, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nJill perceived that an opening for those tedious explanations had been\r\ngranted her.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Chris thinks so,” she said demurely.\r\n\r\nWally looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Chris? Oh, your uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But—he has never been here.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. He’s giving a dinner party here tonight!”\r\n\r\n“He’s … what did you say?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right. I only began at the end of the story instead of the\r\nbeginning. I’ll tell you the whole thing, then … then I suppose you\r\nwill be terribly angry and make a fuss.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not much of a lad, as Freddie Rooke would say, for making fusses.\r\nAnd I can’t imagine being terribly angry with you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll risk it. Though, if I wasn’t a brave girl, I should leave\r\nUncle Chris to explain for himself and simply run away.”\r\n\r\n“Anything is better than that. It’s a miracle meeting you like this,\r\nand I don’t want to be deprived of the fruits of it. Tell me anything,\r\nbut don’t go.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be furious.”\r\n\r\n“Not with you.”\r\n\r\n“I should hope not with me. I’ve done nothing. I am the innocent\r\nheroine. But I’m afraid you will be very angry with Uncle Chris.”\r\n\r\n“If he’s your uncle, that passes him. Besides, he once licked the\r\nstuffing out of me with a whangee. That forms a bond. Tell me all.”\r\n\r\nJill considered. She had promised to begin at the beginning, but it was\r\ndifficult to know what was the beginning.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever heard of Captain Kidd?” she asked at length.\r\n\r\n“You’re wandering from the point, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not. _Have_ you heard of Captain Kidd?”\r\n\r\n“The pirate? Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Uncle Chris is his direct lineal descendant. That really\r\nexplains the whole thing.”\r\n\r\nWally looked at her enquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Could you make it a little easier?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I can tell you everything in half a dozen words, if you like. But it\r\nwill sound awfully abrupt.”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead.”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Chris has stolen your apartment.”\r\n\r\nWally nodded slowly.\r\n\r\n“I see. Stolen my apartment.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you can’t possibly understand. I shall have to tell you the\r\nwhole thing, after all.”\r\n\r\nWally listened with flattering attention as she began the epic of Major\r\nChristopher Selby’s doings in New York. Whatever his emotions, he\r\ncertainly was not bored.\r\n\r\n“So that’s how it all happened,” concluded Jill.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Wally said nothing. He seemed to be digesting what he had\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n“I see,” he said at last. “It’s a variant of those advertisements they\r\nprint in the magazines. ‘Why pay rent? Own somebody else’s home!’”\r\n\r\n“That _does_ rather sum it up,” said Jill.\r\n\r\nWally burst into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n“He’s a corker!”\r\n\r\nJill was immensely relieved. For all her courageous bearing, she had\r\nnot relished the task of breaking the news to Wally. She knew that he\r\nhad a sense of humor, but a man may have a sense of humor and yet not\r\nsee anything amusing in having his home stolen in his absence.\r\n\r\n“I’m so glad you’re not angry.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not.”\r\n\r\n“Most men would be.”\r\n\r\n“Most men are chumps.”\r\n\r\n“It’s so wonderful that it happened to be you. Suppose it had been an\r\nutter stranger! What could I have done?”\r\n\r\n“It would have been the same thing. You would have won him over in two\r\nminutes. Nobody could resist you.”\r\n\r\n“That’s very sweet of you.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help telling the truth. Washington was just the same.”\r\n\r\n“Then you don’t mind Uncle Chris giving his dinner-party here tonight?”\r\n\r\n“He has my blessing.”\r\n\r\n“You really are an angel,” said Jill gratefully. “From what he said, I\r\nthink he looks on it as rather an important function. He has invited a\r\nvery rich woman, who has been showing him a lot of hospitality,—a Mrs\r\nPeagrim …”\r\n\r\n“Mrs Waddesleigh Peagrim?”\r\n\r\n“Yes? Why, do you know her?”\r\n\r\n“Quite well. She goes in a good deal for being Bohemian and knowing\r\npeople who write and paint and act and so on. That reminds me. I gave\r\nFreddie Rooke a letter of introduction to her.”\r\n\r\n“Freddie Rooke!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He suddenly made up his mind to come over. He came to me for\r\nadvice about the journey. He sailed a couple of days before I did. I\r\nsuppose he’s somewhere in New York by now, unless he was going on to\r\nFlorida. He didn’t tell me what his plans were.”\r\n\r\nJill was conscious of a sudden depression. Much as she liked Freddie,\r\nhe belonged to a chapter in her life which was closed and which she was\r\ntrying her hardest to forget. It was impossible to think of Freddie\r\nwithout thinking of Derek, and to think of Derek was like touching an\r\nexposed nerve. The news that Freddie was in New York shocked her. New\r\nYork had already shown itself a city of chance encounters. Could she\r\navoid meeting Freddie?\r\n\r\nShe knew Freddie so well. There was not a dearer or a better-hearted\r\nyouth in the world, but he had not that fine sensibility which pilots a\r\nman through the awkwardnesses of life. He was a blunderer. Instinct\r\ntold her that, if she met Freddie, he would talk of Derek, and, if\r\nthinking of Derek was touching an exposed nerve, talking of him would\r\nlike pressing on that nerve with a heavy hand. She shivered.\r\n\r\nWally was observant.\r\n\r\n“There’s no need to meet him, if you don’t want to,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jill doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“New York’s a large place. By the way,” he went on, “to return once\r\nmore to the interesting subject of my lodger, does your uncle sleep\r\nhere at nights, do you know?”\r\n\r\nJill looked at him gratefully. He was no blunderer. Her desire to avoid\r\nFreddie Rooke was, he gave her tacitly to understand, her business, and\r\nhe did not propose to intrude on it. She liked him for dismissing the\r\nsubject so easily.\r\n\r\n“No, I think he told me he doesn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s something, isn’t it! I call that darned nice of him! I\r\nwonder if I could drop back here somewhere about eleven o’clock. Are\r\nthe festivities likely to be over by then? If I know Mrs Peagrim, she\r\nwill insist on going off to one of the hotels to dance directly after\r\ndinner. She’s a confirmed trotter.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how to apologize,” began Jill remorsefully.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t. It’s absolutely all right.” His eye wandered to the\r\nmantelpiece, as it had done once or twice during the conversation. In\r\nher hurry Jill had replaced the snapshot with its back to the room, and\r\nWally had the fidgety air of a man whose most cherished possession is\r\nmaltreated. He got up now and, walking across, turned the photograph\r\nround. He stood for a moment, looking at it.\r\n\r\nJill had forgotten the snapshot. Curiosity returned to her.\r\n\r\n“Where _did_ you get that?” she asked.\r\n\r\nWally turned.\r\n\r\n“Oh, did you see this?”\r\n\r\n“I was looking at it just before you nearly frightened me to death by\r\nappearing so unexpectedly.”\r\n\r\n“Freddie Rooke sold it to me fourteen years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Fourteen years ago!”\r\n\r\n“Next July,” added Wally. “I gave him five shillings for it.”\r\n\r\n“Five shillings! The little brute!” cried Jill indignantly “It must\r\nhave been all the money you had in the world!”\r\n\r\n“A trifle more, as a matter of fact. All the money I had in the world\r\nwas three-and-six. But by a merciful dispensation of Providence the\r\ncurate had called that morning and left a money-box for subscriptions\r\nto the village organ-fund … It’s wonderful what you can do with a turn\r\nfor crime and the small blade of a pocket-knife! I don’t think I have\r\never made money quicker!” He looked at the photograph again. “Not that\r\nit seemed quick at the moment. I died at least a dozen agonizing deaths\r\nin the few minutes I was operating. Have you ever noticed how slowly\r\ntime goes when you are coaxing a shilling and a sixpence out of\r\nsomebody’s money-box? Centuries! But I was forgetting. Of course you’ve\r\nhad no experience.”\r\n\r\n“You poor thing!”\r\n\r\n“It was worth it.”\r\n\r\n“And you’ve had it ever since!”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t part with it for all Mrs Waddesleigh Peagrim’s millions,”\r\nsaid Wally with sudden and startling vehemence, “if she offered me\r\nthem.” He paused. “She hasn’t, as a matter of fact.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Jill looked at Wally furtively, as he returned to\r\nhis seat. She was seeing him with new eyes. It was as if this trifling\r\nincident had removed some sort of a veil. He had suddenly become more\r\nalive. For an instant she had seen right into him, to the hidden deeps\r\nof his soul. She felt shy and embarrassed.\r\n\r\n“Pat died,” she said, at length. She felt the necessity of saying\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n“I liked Pat.”\r\n\r\n“He picked up some poison, poor darling … How long ago those days seem,\r\ndon’t they!”\r\n\r\n“They are always pretty vivid to me. I wonder who has that old house of\r\nyours now.”\r\n\r\n“I heard the other day,” said Jill more easily. The odd sensation of\r\nembarrassment was passing. “Some people called … what was the name?…\r\nDebenham, I think.”\r\n\r\nSilence fell again. It was broken by the front-door bell, like an\r\nalarm-clock that shatters a dream.\r\n\r\nWally got up.\r\n\r\n“Your uncle,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You aren’t going to open the door?”\r\n\r\n“That was the scheme.”\r\n\r\n“But he’ll get such a shock when he sees you.”\r\n\r\n“He must look on it in the light of rent. I don’t see why I shouldn’t\r\nhave a little passing amusement from this business.”\r\n\r\nHe left the room. Jill heard the front door open. She waited\r\nbreathlessly. Pity for Uncle Chris struggled with the sterner feeling\r\nthat it served him right.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” she heard Wally say.\r\n\r\n“Hullo-ullo-ullo!” replied an exuberant voice. “Wondered if I’d find\r\nyou in, and all that sort of thing. I say, what a deuce of a way up it\r\nis here. Sort of gets a chap into training for going to heaven, what? I\r\nmean, what?”\r\n\r\nJill looked about her like a trapped animal. It was absurd, she felt,\r\nbut every nerve in her body cried out against the prospect of meeting\r\nFreddie. His very voice had opened old wounds and set them throbbing.\r\n\r\nShe listened in the doorway. Out of sight down the passage, Freddie\r\nseemed by the sounds to be removing his overcoat. She stole out and\r\ndarted like a shadow down the corridor that led to Wally’s bedroom. The\r\nwindow of the bedroom opened onto the wide roof which Uncle Chris had\r\neulogized. She slipped noiselessly out, closing the window behind her.\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n“I say, Mason, old top,” said Freddie, entering the sitting-room, “I\r\nhope you don’t mind my barging in like this but the fact is things are\r\na bit thick. I’m dashed worried and I didn’t know another soul I could\r\ntalk it over with. As a matter of fact, I wasn’t sure you were in New\r\nYork at all but I remembered hearing you say in London that you went\r\npopping back almost at once, so I looked you up in the telephone book\r\nand took a chance. I’m dashed glad you _are_ back. When did you\r\narrive?”\r\n\r\n“This afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been here two or three days. Well, it’s a bit of luck catching\r\nyou. You see, what I want to ask your advice about …”\r\n\r\nWally looked at his watch. He was not surprised to find that Jill had\r\ntaken to flight. He understood her feelings perfectly, and was anxious\r\nto get rid of the inopportune Freddie as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to talk quick, I’m afraid,” he said. “I’ve lent this place\r\nto a man for the evening, and he’s having some people to dinner. What’s\r\nthe trouble?”\r\n\r\n“It’s about Jill.”\r\n\r\n“Jill?”\r\n\r\n“Jill Mariner, you know. You remember Jill? You haven’t forgotten my\r\ntelling you all that? About her losing her money and coming over to\r\nAmerica?”\r\n\r\n“No. I remember you telling me that.”\r\n\r\nFreddie seemed to miss something in his companion’s manner, some note\r\nof excitement and perturbation.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he said, as if endeavoring to explain this to himself,\r\n“you hardly knew her, I suppose. Only met once since you were kids and\r\nall that sort of thing. But I’m a pal of hers and I’m dashed upset by\r\nthe whole business, I can tell you. It worries me, I mean to say. Poor\r\ngirl, you know, landed on her uppers in a strange country. Well, I\r\nmean, it worries me. So the first thing I did when I got here was to\r\ntry to find her. That’s why I came over, really, to try to find her.\r\nApart from anything else, you see, poor old Derek is dashed worried\r\nabout her.”\r\n\r\n“Need we bring Underhill in?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know you don’t like him and think he behaved rather rummily and\r\nso forth, but that’s all right now.”\r\n\r\n“It is, is it?” said Wally drily.\r\n\r\n“Oh, absolutely. It’s all on again.”\r\n\r\n“What’s all on again?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I mean he wants to marry Jill. I came over to find her and tell\r\nher so.”\r\n\r\nWally’s eyes glowed.\r\n\r\n“If you have come over as an ambassador …”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. Jolly old ambassador. Very word I used myself.”\r\n\r\n“I say, if you have come over as an ambassador with the idea of\r\nreopening negotiations with Jill on behalf of that infernal swine …”\r\n\r\n“Old man!” protested Freddie, pained. “Pal of mine, you know.”\r\n\r\n“If he is, after what’s happened, your mental processes are beyond me.”\r\n\r\n“My what, old son?”\r\n\r\n“Your mental processes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, ah!” said Freddie, learning for the first time that he had any.\r\n\r\nWally looked at him intently. There was a curious expression on his\r\nrough-hewn face.\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand you, Freddie. If ever there was a fellow who might\r\nhave been expected to take the only possible view of Underhill’s\r\nbehavior in this business, I should have said it was you. You’re a\r\npublic-school man. You’ve mixed all the time with decent people. You\r\nwouldn’t do anything that wasn’t straight yourself to save your life,\r\nit seems to have made absolutely no difference in your opinion of this\r\nman Underhill that he behaved like an utter cad to a girl who was one\r\nof your best friends. You seem to worship him just as much as ever. And\r\nyou have travelled three thousand miles to bring a message from him to\r\nJill—Good God! _Jill!_—to the effect, as far as I understand it, that\r\nhe has thought it over and come to the conclusion that after all she\r\nmay possibly be good enough for him!”\r\n\r\nFreddie recovered the eye-glass which the raising of his eyebrows had\r\ncaused to fall, and polished it in a crushed sort of way. Rummy, he\r\nreflected, how chappies stayed the same all their lives as they were\r\nwhen they were kids. Nasty, tough sort of chap Wally Mason had been as\r\na boy, and here he was, apparently, not altered a bit. At least, the\r\nonly improvement he could detect was that, whereas in the old days\r\nWally, when in an ugly mood like this, would undoubtedly have kicked\r\nhim, he now seemed content with mere words. All the same, he was being\r\ndashed unpleasant. And he was all wrong about poor old Derek. This last\r\nfact he endeavored to make clear.\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand,” he said. “You don’t realize. You’ve never met\r\nLady Underhill, have you?”\r\n\r\n“What has she got to do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Everything, old bean, everything. If it hadn’t been for her, there\r\nwouldn’t have been any trouble of any description, sort, or order. But\r\nshe barged in and savaged poor old Derek till she absolutely made him\r\nbreak off the engagement.”\r\n\r\n“If you call him ‘poor old Derek’ again, Freddie,” said Wally\r\nviciously, “I’ll drop you out of the window and throw your hat after\r\nyou! If he’s such a gelatine-backboned worm that his mother can …”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know her, old thing! She’s _the_ original hellhound!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what …”\r\n\r\n“Must be seen to be believed,” mumbled Freddie.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what she’s like! Any man who could …”\r\n\r\n“Once seen, never forgotten!”\r\n\r\n“Damn you! Don’t interrupt every time I try to get a word in!”\r\n\r\n“Sorry, old man! Shan’t occur again!”\r\n\r\nWally moved to the window, and stood looking out. He had had much more\r\nto say on the subject of Derek Underhill, but Freddie’s interruptions\r\nhad put it out of his head, and he felt irritated and baffled.\r\n\r\n“Well, all I can say is,” he remarked savagely, “that, if you have come\r\nover here as an ambassador to try and effect a reconciliation between\r\nJill and Underhill, I hope to God you’ll never find her.”\r\n\r\nFreddie emitted a weak cough, like a very far-off asthmatic old sheep.\r\nHe was finding Wally more overpowering every moment. He had rather\r\nforgotten the dear old days of his childhood, but this conversation was\r\nbeginning to refresh his memory: and he was realizing more vividly with\r\nevery moment that passed how very Wallyish Wally was,—how\r\nextraordinarily like the Wally who had dominated his growing intellect\r\nwhen they were both in Eton suits. Freddie in those days had been all\r\nfor peace, and he was all for peace now. He made his next observation\r\ndiffidently.\r\n\r\n“I _have_ found her!”\r\n\r\nWally spun round.\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“When I say that, I don’t absolutely mean. I’ve seen her. I mean I know\r\nwhere she is. That’s what I came round to see you about. Felt I must\r\ntalk it over, you know. The situation seems to me dashed rotten and not\r\na little thick. The fact is, old man, she’s gone on the stage. In the\r\nchorus, you know. And, I mean to say, well, if you follow what I’m\r\ndriving at, what, what?”\r\n\r\n“In the chorus!”\r\n\r\n“In the chorus!”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\nFreddie groped for his eye-glass, which had fallen again.\r\n\r\nHe regarded it a trifle sternly. He was fond of the little chap, but it\r\nwas always doing that sort of thing. The whole trouble was that, if you\r\nwanted to keep it in its place, you simply couldn’t register any sort\r\nof emotion with the good old features: and, when you were chatting with\r\na fellow like Wally Mason, you had to be registering something all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“Well, that was a bit of luck, as a matter of fact. When I first got\r\nhere, you know, it seemed to me the only thing to do was to round up a\r\nmerry old detective and put the matter in his hands, like they do in\r\nstories. _You_ know! Ring at the bell. ‘And this, if I mistake not,\r\nWatson, is my client now.’ And then in breezes client and spills the\r\nplot. I found a sleuth in the classified telephone directory, and\r\ntoddled round. Rummy chaps, detectives! Ever met any? I always thought\r\nthey were lean, hatchet-faced Johnnies with inscrutable smiles. This\r\none looked just like my old Uncle Ted, the one who died of apoplexy.\r\nJovial, puffy-faced bird, who kept bobbing up behind a fat cigar. Have\r\nyou ever noticed what whacking big cigars these fellows over here\r\nsmoke? Rummy country, America. You ought to have seen the way this\r\nblighter could shift his cigar right across his face without moving his\r\njaw-muscles. Like a flash! Most remarkable thing you ever saw, I give\r\nyou my honest word! He …”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t you keep your Impressions of America for the book you’re\r\ngoing to write, and come to the point?” said Wally rudely.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, old chap,” said Freddie meekly. “Glad you reminded me. Well …\r\nOh, yes. We had got as far as the jovial old human bloodhound, hadn’t\r\nwe? Well, I put the matter before this chappie. Told him I wanted to\r\nfind a girl, showed him a photograph, and so forth. I say,” said\r\nFreddie, wandering off once more into speculation, “why is it that\r\ncoves like that always talk of a girl as ‘the little lady’? This chap\r\nkept saying ‘We’ll find the little lady for you!’ Oh, well, that’s\r\nrather off the rails, isn’t it? It just floated across my mind and I\r\nthought I’d mention it. Well, this blighter presumably nosed about and\r\nmade enquiries for a couple of days, but didn’t effect anything that\r\nyou might call substantial. I’m not blaming him, mind you. I shouldn’t\r\ncare to have a job like that myself. I mean to say, when you come to\r\nthink of what a frightful number of girls there are in this place, to\r\nhave to … well, as I say, he did his best but didn’t click; and then\r\nthis evening, just before I came here, I met a girl I had known in\r\nEngland—she was in a show over there—a girl called Nelly Bryant …”\r\n\r\n“Nelly Bryant? I know her.”\r\n\r\n“Yes? Fancy that! She was in a thing called ‘Follow the Girl’ in\r\nLondon. Did you see it by any chance? Topping show! There was one scene\r\nwhere the …”\r\n\r\n“Get on! Get on! I wrote it,”\r\n\r\n“You wrote it?” Freddie beamed simple-hearted admiration. “My dear old\r\nchap, I congratulate you! One of the ripest and most all-wool musical\r\ncomedies I’ve ever seen. I went twenty-four times. Rummy I don’t\r\nremember spotting that you wrote it. I suppose one never looks at the\r\nnames on the programme. Yes, I went twenty-four times. The first time I\r\nwent was with a couple of chappies from …”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Freddie!” said Wally feverishly. “On some other occasion I\r\nshould dearly love to hear the story of your life, but just now …”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely, old man. You’re perfectly right. Well, to cut a long story\r\nshort, Nelly Bryant told me that she and Jill were rehearsing with a\r\npiece called ‘The Rose of America.’”\r\n\r\n“‘The Rose of America!’”\r\n\r\n“I think that was the name of it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s Ike Goble’s show. He called me up on the phone about it half an\r\nhour ago. I promised to go and see a rehearsal of it tomorrow or the\r\nday after. And Jill’s in that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. How about it? I mean, I don’t know much about this sort of thing,\r\nbut do you think it’s the sort of thing Jill ought to be doing?”\r\n\r\nWally was moving restlessly about the room. Freddie’s news had\r\ndisquieted him. Mr Goble had a reputation.\r\n\r\n“I know a lot about it,” he replied, “and it certainly isn’t.” He\r\nscowled at the carpet. “Oh, damn everybody!”\r\n\r\nFreddie paused to allow him to proceed, if such should be his wish, but\r\nWally had apparently said his say. Freddie went on to point out an\r\naspect of the matter which was troubling him greatly.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure poor old Derek wouldn’t like her being in the chorus!”\r\n\r\nWally started so violently that for a moment Freddie was uneasy.\r\n\r\n“I mean Underhill,” he corrected himself hastily.\r\n\r\n“Freddie,” said Wally, “you’re an awfully good chap, but I wish you\r\nwould exit rapidly now! Thanks for coming and telling me, very good of\r\nyou. This way out!”\r\n\r\n“But, old man … !”\r\n\r\n“Now what?”\r\n\r\n“I thought we were going to discuss this binge and decide what to do\r\nand all that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\n“Some other time. I want to think about it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you will think about it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ll think about it.”\r\n\r\n“Topping! You see, you’re a brainy sort of feller, and you’ll probably\r\nhit something.”\r\n\r\n“I probably shall, if you don’t go.”\r\n\r\n“Eh? Oh, ah, yes!” Freddie struggled into his coat. More than ever did\r\nthe adult Wally remind him of the dangerous stripling of years gone by.\r\n“Well, cheerio!”\r\n\r\n“Same to you!”\r\n\r\n“You’ll let me know if you scare up some devilish fruity wheeze, won’t\r\nyou? I’m at the Biltmore.”\r\n\r\n“Very good place to be. Go there now.”\r\n\r\n“Right ho! Well, toodle-oo!”\r\n\r\n“The elevator is at the foot of the stairs,” said Wally. “You press the\r\nbell and up it comes. You hop in and down you go. It’s a great\r\ninvention! Good night!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say. One moment …”\r\n\r\n“Good _night!_” said Wally.\r\n\r\nHe closed the door, and ran down the passage.\r\n\r\n“Jill!” he called. He opened the bedroom window and stepped out.\r\n“Jill!”\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\n“Jill!” called Wally once again, but again there was no answer.\r\n\r\nWally walked to the parapet, and looked over. Below him the vastness of\r\nthe city stretched itself in a great triangle, its apex the harbor, its\r\nsides the dull silver of the East and Hudson rivers. Directly before\r\nhim, crowned with its white lantern, the Metropolitan Tower reared its\r\ngraceful height to the stars. And all around, in the windows of the\r\ntall buildings that looked from this bastion on which he stood almost\r\nsquat, a million lights stared up at him, the unsleeping eyes of New\r\nYork. It was a scene of which Wally, always sensitive to beauty, never\r\ntired: but tonight it had lost its appeal. A pleasant breeze from the\r\nJersey shore greeted him with a quickening whisper of springtime and\r\nromance, but it did not lift the heaviness of his heart. He felt\r\ndepressed and apprehensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nSpring, whose coming the breeze had heralded to Wally as he smoked upon\r\nthe roof, floated graciously upon New York two mornings later. The city\r\nawoke to a day of blue and gold and to a sense of hard times over and\r\ngood times to come. In a million homes, a million young men thought of\r\nsunny afternoons at the Polo Grounds; a million young women of long\r\nsummer Sundays by the crowded waves of Coney Island. In his apartment\r\non Park Avenue, Mr Isaac Goble, sniffing the gentle air from the window\r\nof his breakfast-room, returned to his meal and his _Morning Telegraph_\r\nwith a resolve to walk to the theatre for rehearsal: a resolve which\r\nhad also come to Jill and Nelly Bryant, eating stewed prunes in their\r\nboarding-house in the Forties. On the summit of his sky-scraper, Wally\r\nMason, performing Swedish exercises to the delectation of various\r\nclerks and stenographers in the upper windows of neighboring buildings,\r\nfelt young and vigorous and optimistic; and went in to his shower-bath\r\nthinking of Jill. And it was of Jill, too, that young Mr Pilkington\r\nthought, as he propped his long form up against the pillows and sipped\r\nhis morning cup of tea. He had not yet had an opportunity of inspecting\r\nthe day for himself, but his Japanese valet, who had been round the\r\ncorner for papers, had spoken well of it; and even in his bedroom the\r\nsunlight falling on the carpet gave some indication of what might be\r\nexpected outside. For the first time in several days a certain\r\nmoodiness which had affected Otis Pilkington left him, and he dreamed\r\nhappy daydreams.\r\n\r\nThe gaiety of Otis was not, however, entirely or even primarily due to\r\nthe improvement in the weather. It had its source in a conversation\r\nwhich had taken place between himself and Jill’s Uncle Chris on the\r\nprevious night. Exactly how it had come about, Mr Pilkington was not\r\nentirely clear, but, somehow, before he was fully aware of what he was\r\nsaying, he had begun to pour into Major Selby’s sympathetic ears the\r\nstory of his romance. Encouraged by the other’s kindly receptiveness,\r\nhe had told him all—his love for Jill, his hopes that some day it might\r\nbe returned, the difficulties complicating the situation owing to the\r\nknown prejudices of Mrs Waddesleigh Peagrim concerning girls who formed\r\nthe _personnel_ of musical comedy _ensembles_. To all these outpourings\r\nMajor Selby had listened with keen attention, and finally had made one\r\nof those luminous suggestions, so simple yet so shrewd, which emanate\r\nonly from your man of the world. It was Jill’s girlish ambition, it\r\nseemed from Major Selby’s statement, to become a force in the\r\nmotion-picture world. The movies were her objective. When she had told\r\nhim of this, said Uncle Chris, he had urged her, speaking in her best\r\ninterests, to gain experience by joining in the humblest capacity the\r\ncompany of some good musical play, where she could learn from the best\r\nmasters so much of the technique of the business. That done, she could\r\ngo about her life-work, fortified and competent.\r\n\r\nWhat, he broke off to ask, did Pilkington think of the idea?\r\n\r\nPilkington thought the idea splendid. Miss Mariner, with her charm and\r\nlooks, would be wonderful in the movies.\r\n\r\nThere was, said Uncle Chris, a future for a girl in the movies.\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington agreed cordially. A great future.\r\n\r\n“Look at Mary Pickford!” said Uncle Chris. “Millions a year!”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington contemplated Miss Pickford, and agreed again. He\r\ninstanced other stars—lesser luminaries, perhaps, but each with her\r\nthousands a week. There was no doubt about it—a girl’s best friend was\r\nthe movies.\r\n\r\n“Observe,” proceeded Uncle Chris, gathering speed and expanding his\r\nchest as he spread his legs before the fire, “how it would simplify the\r\nwhole matter if Jill were to become a motion-picture artist and win\r\nfame and wealth in her profession. And there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt, my boy, that she would. As you say, with her appearance and her\r\ncharm … Which of these women whose names you see all along Broadway in\r\nelectric lights can hold a candle to her? Once started, with the proper\r\nbacking behind her, her future would be assured. And then. … Of course,\r\nas regards her feelings I cannot speak, as I know nothing of them, but\r\nwe will assume that she is not indifferent to you … what then? You go\r\nto your excellent aunt and announce that you are engaged to be married\r\nto Jill Mariner. There is a momentary pause. ‘Not _the_ Jill Mariner?’\r\nfalters Mrs Peagrim. ‘Yes, the famous Miss Mariner!’ you reply. Well, I\r\nask you, my boy, can you see her making an objection? Such a thing\r\nwould be absurd. No, I can see no flaw in the project whatsoever.” Here\r\nUncle Chris, as he had pictured Mrs Peagrim doing, paused for a moment.\r\n“Of course, there would be the preliminaries.”\r\n\r\n“The preliminaries?”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris’ voice became a melodious coo. He beamed upon Mr\r\nPilkington.\r\n\r\n“Well, think for yourself, my boy! These things cannot be done without\r\nmoney. I do not propose to allow my niece to waste her time and her\r\nenergy in the rank and file of the profession, waiting years for a\r\nchance that might never come. There is plenty of room at the top, and\r\nthat, in the motion-picture profession, is the place to start. If Jill\r\nis to become a motion-picture artist, a special company must be formed\r\nto promote her. She must be made a feature, a star, from the beginning.\r\nThat is why I have advised her to accept her present position\r\ntemporarily, in order that she may gain experience. She must learn to\r\nwalk before she runs. She must study before she soars. But when the\r\nmoment arrives for her to take the step, she must not be hampered by\r\nlack of money. Whether,” said Uncle Chris, smoothing the crease of his\r\ntrousers, “you would wish to take shares in the company yourself …”\r\n\r\n“Oo … !”\r\n\r\n“… is a matter,” proceeded Uncle Chris, ignoring the interruption, “for\r\nyou yourself to decide. Possibly you have other claims on your purse.\r\nPossibly this musical play of yours has taken all the cash you are\r\nprepared to lock up. Possibly you may consider the venture too\r\nspeculative. Possibly … there are a hundred reasons why you may not\r\nwish to join us. But I know a dozen men—I can go down Wall Street\r\ntomorrow and pick out twenty men—who will be glad to advance the\r\nnecessary capital. I can assure you that I personally shall not\r\nhesitate to risk—if one can call it risking—any loose cash which I may\r\nhave lying idle at my banker’s.”\r\n\r\nHe rattled the loose cash which he had lying idle in his\r\ntrouser-pocket—fifteen cents in all—and stopped to flick a piece of\r\nfluff off his coat-sleeve. Mr Pilkington was thus enabled to insert a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“How much would you want?” he enquired.\r\n\r\n“That,” said Uncle Chris meditatively, “is a little hard to say. I\r\nshould have to look into the matter more closely in order to give you\r\nthe exact figures. But let us say for the sake of argument that you put\r\nup—what shall we say?—a hundred thousand? fifty thousand?… no, we will\r\nbe conservative. Perhaps you had better not begin with more than ten\r\nthousand. You can always buy more shares later. I don’t suppose I shall\r\nbegin with more than ten thousand myself.”\r\n\r\n“I could manage ten thousand all right.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent. We make progress, we make progress. Very well, then. I go\r\nto my Wall Street friends—I would give you their names, only for the\r\npresent, till something definite has been done, that would hardly be\r\npolitic—I go to my Wall Street friends, and tell them about the scheme,\r\nand say ‘Here is ten thousand dollars! What is your contribution?’ It\r\nputs the affair on a business-like basis, you understand. Then we\r\nreally get to work. But use your own judgment my boy, you know. Use\r\nyour own judgment. I would not think of persuading you to take such a\r\nstep, if you felt at all doubtful. Think it over. Sleep on it. And,\r\nwhatever you decide to do, on no account say a word about it to Jill.\r\nIt would be cruel to raise her hopes until we are certain that we are\r\nin a position to enable her to realize them. And, of course, not a word\r\nto Mrs Peagrim.”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, my boy.” said Uncle Chris affably. “I will leave you\r\nto turn the whole thing over in your mind. Act entirely as you think\r\nbest. How is your insomnia, by the way? Did you try Nervino? Capital!\r\nThere’s nothing like it. It did wonders for _me!_ Good-night,\r\ngood-night!”\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington had been turning the thing over in his mind, with an\r\ninterval for sleep, ever since. And the more he thought of it, the\r\nbetter the scheme appeared to him. He winced a little at the thought of\r\nthe ten thousand dollars, for he came of prudent stock and had been\r\nbrought up in habits of parsimony, but, after all, he reflected, the\r\nmoney would be merely a loan. Once the company found its feet, it would\r\nbe returned to him a hundred-fold. And there was no doubt that this\r\nwould put a completely different aspect on his wooing of Jill, as far\r\nas his Aunt Olive was concerned. Why, a cousin of his—young Brewster\r\nPhilmore—had married a movie-star only two years ago, and nobody had\r\nmade the slightest objection. Brewster was to be seen with his bride\r\nfrequently beneath Mrs Peagrim’s roof. Against the higher strata of\r\nBohemia Mrs Peagrim had no prejudice at all. Quite the reverse, in\r\nfact. She liked the society of those whose names were often in the\r\npapers and much in the public mouth. It seemed to Otis Pilkington, in\r\nshort, that Love had found a way. He sipped his tea with relish, and\r\nwhen the Japanese valet brought in the toast all burned on one side,\r\nchided him with a gentle sweetness which, one may hope, touched the\r\nlatter’s Oriental heart and inspired him with a desire to serve this\r\nbest of employers more efficiently.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten, Otis Pilkington removed his dressing-gown and began\r\nto put on his clothes to visit the theatre. There was a rehearsal-call\r\nfor the whole company at eleven. As he dressed, his mood was as sunny\r\nas the day itself.\r\n\r\nAnd the day, by half-past ten, was as sunny as ever Spring day had been\r\nin a country where Spring comes early and does its best from the very\r\nstart. The blue sky beamed down on a happy city. To and fro the\r\ncitizenry bustled, aglow with the perfection of the weather. Everywhere\r\nwas gaiety and good cheer, except on the stage of the Gotham Theatre,\r\nwhere an early rehearsal, preliminary to the main event, had been\r\ncalled by Johnson Miller in order to iron some of the kinks out of the\r\n“My Heart and I” number, which, with the assistance of the male chorus,\r\nthe leading lady was to render in act one.\r\n\r\nOn the stage of the Gotham gloom reigned—literally, because the stage\r\nwas wide and deep and was illumined only by a single electric light:\r\nand figuratively, because things were going even worse than usual with\r\nthe “My Heart and I” number, and Johnson Miller, always of an emotional\r\nand easily stirred temperament, had been goaded by the incompetence of\r\nhis male chorus to a state of frenzy. At about the moment when Otis\r\nPilkington shed his flowered dressing-gown and reached for his trousers\r\n(the heather-mixture with the red twill), Johnson Miller was pacing the\r\ngangway between the orchestra pit and the first row of the orchestra\r\nchairs, waving one hand and clutching his white locks with the other,\r\nhis voice raised the while in agonized protest.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, you silly idiots,” complained Mr Miller loudly, “you’ve had\r\nthree weeks to get these movements into your thick heads, and you\r\nhaven’t done a damn thing right! You’re all over the place! You don’t\r\nseem able to turn without tumbling over each other like a lot of\r\nKeystone Kops! What’s the matter with you? You’re not doing the\r\nmovements I showed you; you’re doing some you have invented yourselves,\r\nand they are rotten! I’ve no doubt you think you can arrange a number\r\nbetter than I can, but Mr Goble engaged me to be the director, so\r\nkindly do exactly as I tell you. Don’t try to use your own\r\nintelligence, because you haven’t any. I’m not blaming you for it. It\r\nwasn’t your fault that your nurses dropped you on your heads when you\r\nwere babies. But it handicaps you when you try to think.”\r\n\r\nOf the seven gentlemanly members of the male ensemble present, six\r\nlooked wounded by this tirade. They had the air of good men wrongfully\r\naccused. They appeared to be silently calling on Heaven to see justice\r\ndone between Mr. Miller and themselves. The seventh, a long-legged\r\nyoung man in faultlessly-fitting tweeds of English cut, seemed, on the\r\nother hand, not so much hurt as embarrassed. It was this youth who now\r\nstepped down to the darkened footlights and spoke in a remorseful and\r\nconscience-stricken manner.\r\n\r\n“I say!”\r\n\r\nMr Miller, that martyr to deafness, did not hear the pathetic bleat. He\r\nhad swung off at right angles and was marching in an overwrought way up\r\nthe central aisle leading to the back of the house, his india rubber\r\nform moving in convulsive jerks. Only when he had turned and retraced\r\nhis steps did he perceive the speaker and prepare to take his share in\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n“What?” he shouted. “Can’t hear you!”\r\n\r\n“I say, you know, it’s my fault, really.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“I mean to say, you know …”\r\n\r\n“What? Speak up, can’t you?”\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg, who had been seated at the piano, absently playing a\r\nmelody from his unproduced musical comedy, awoke to the fact that the\r\nservices of an interpreter were needed. He obligingly left the\r\nmusic-stool and crept, crablike, along the ledge of the stage-box. He\r\nplaced his arm about Mr Miller’s shoulders and his lips to Mr Miller’s\r\nleft ear, and drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n“He says it is his fault!”\r\n\r\nMr Miller nodded adhesion to this admirable sentiment.\r\n\r\n“I know they’re not worth their salt!” he replied.\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg patiently took in a fresh stock of breath.\r\n\r\n“This young man says it is his fault that the movement went wrong!”\r\n\r\n“Tell him I only signed on this morning, laddie,” urged the tweed-clad\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n“He only joined the company this morning!”\r\n\r\nThis puzzled Mr Miller.\r\n\r\n“How do you mean, warning?” he asked.\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg, purple in the face, made a last effort.\r\n\r\n“This young man is new,” he bellowed carefully, keeping to words of one\r\nsyllable. “He does not yet know the steps. He says this is his first\r\nday here, so he does not yet know the steps. When he has been here some\r\nmore time he will know the steps. But now he does not know the steps.”\r\n\r\n“What he means,” explained the young man in tweeds helpfully, “is that\r\nI don’t know the steps.”\r\n\r\n“He does not know the steps!” roared Mr Saltzburg.\r\n\r\n“I know he doesn’t know the steps,” said Mr Miller. “Why doesn’t he\r\nknow the steps? He’s had long enough to learn them.”\r\n\r\n“He is new!”\r\n\r\n“Hugh?”\r\n\r\n“New!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, new?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, new!”\r\n\r\n“Why the devil is he new?” cried Mr Miller, awaking suddenly to the\r\ntruth and filled with a sense of outrage. “Why didn’t he join with the\r\nrest of the company? How can I put on chorus numbers if I am saddled\r\nevery day with new people to teach? Who engaged him?”\r\n\r\n“Who engaged you?” enquired Mr Saltzburg of the culprit.\r\n\r\n“Mr Pilkington.”\r\n\r\n“Mr Pilkington,” shouted Mr Saltzburg.\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“Last night.”\r\n\r\n“Last night.”\r\n\r\nMr Miller waved his hands in a gesture of divine despair, spun round,\r\ndarted up the aisle, turned, and bounded back. “What can I do?” he\r\nwailed. “My hands are tied! I am hampered! I am handicapped! We open in\r\ntwo weeks, and every day I find somebody new in the company to upset\r\neverything I have done. I shall go to Mr Goble and ask to be released\r\nfrom my contract. I shall … Come along, come along, come along now!” he\r\nbroke off suddenly. “Why are we wasting time? The whole number once\r\nmore. The whole number once more from the beginning!”\r\n\r\nThe young man tottered back to his gentlemanly colleagues, running a\r\nfinger in an agitated manner round the inside of his collar. He was not\r\nused to this sort of thing. In a large experience of amateur\r\ntheatricals he had never encountered anything like it. In the\r\nbreathing-space afforded by the singing of the first verse and refrain\r\nby the lady who played the heroine of “The Rose of America,” he found\r\ntime to make an enquiry of the artist on his right.\r\n\r\n“I say! Is he always like this?”\r\n\r\n“Who? Johnny?”\r\n\r\n“The sportsman with the hair that turned white in a single night. The\r\nbarker on the skyline. Does he often get the wind up like this?”\r\n\r\nHis colleague smiled tolerantly.\r\n\r\n“Why, that’s nothing!” he replied. “Wait till you see him really cut\r\nloose! That was just a gentle whisper!”\r\n\r\n“My God!” said the newcomer, staring into a bleak future. The leading\r\nlady came to the end of her refrain, and the gentlemen of the ensemble,\r\nwho had been hanging about up-stage, began to curvet nimbly down\r\ntowards her in a double line; the new arrival, with an eye on his\r\nnearest neighbor, endeavouring to curvet as nimbly as the others. A\r\nclapping of hands from the dark auditorium\r\nindicated—inappropriately—that he had failed to do so. Mr Miller could\r\nbe perceived—dimly—with all his fingers entwined in his hair.\r\n\r\n“Clear the stage!” yelled Mr Miller. “Not you!” he shouted, as the\r\nlatest addition to the company began to drift off with the others. “You\r\nstay!”\r\n\r\n“Me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you. I shall have to teach you the steps by yourself, or we shall\r\nget nowhere. Go on-stage. Start the music again, Mr Saltzburg. Now,\r\nwhen the refrain begins, come down. Gracefully! Gracefully!”\r\n\r\nThe young man, pink but determined, began to come down gracefully. And\r\nit was while he was thus occupied that Jill and Nelly Bryant, entering\r\nthe wings which were beginning to fill up as eleven o’clock approached,\r\nsaw him.\r\n\r\n“Whoever is that?” said Nelly.\r\n\r\n“New man,” replied one of the chorus gentlemen. “Came this morning.”\r\n\r\nNelly turned to Jill.\r\n\r\n“He looks just like Mr Rooke!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“He _is_ Mr Rooke!” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“He can’t be!”\r\n\r\n“He _is_!”\r\n\r\n“But what is he doing here?”\r\n\r\nJill bit her lip.\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I’m going to ask him myself,” she said.\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for a private conversation with Freddie did not occur\r\nimmediately. For ten minutes he remained alone on the stage, absorbing\r\nabusive tuition from Mr Miller: and at the end of that period a further\r\nten minutes was occupied with the rehearsing of the number with the\r\nleading lady and the rest of the male chorus. When, finally, a roar\r\nfrom the back of the auditorium announced the arrival of Mr Goble and\r\nat the same time indicated Mr Goble’s desire that the stage should be\r\ncleared and the rehearsal proper begin, a wan smile of recognition and\r\na faint “What ho!” was all that Freddie was able to bestow upon Jill,\r\nbefore, with the rest of the _ensemble_, they had to go out and group\r\nthemselves for the opening chorus. It was only when this had been run\r\nthrough four times and the stage left vacant for two of the principals\r\nto play a scene that Jill was able to draw the Last of the Rookes aside\r\nin a dark corner and put him to the question.\r\n\r\n“Freddie, what are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nFreddie mopped his streaming brow. Johnson Miller’s idea of an opening\r\nchorus was always strenuous. On the present occasion, the ensemble were\r\nsupposed to be guests at a Long Island house-party, and Mr Miller’s\r\nconception of the gathering suggested that he supposed house-party\r\nguests on Long Island to consist exclusively of victims of St Vitus’\r\ndance. Freddie was feeling limp, battered, and exhausted: and, from\r\nwhat he had gathered, the worst was yet to come.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” he said feebly.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, ah, yes! I see what you mean! I suppose you’re surprised to find\r\nme in New York, what?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not surprised to find you in New York. I knew you had come over.\r\nBut I am surprised to find you on the stage, being bullied by Mr\r\nMiller.”\r\n\r\n“I say,” said Freddie in an awed voice. “He’s a bit of a nut, that lad,\r\nwhat! He reminds me of the troops of Midian in the hymn. The chappies\r\nwho prowled and prowled around. I’ll bet he’s worn a groove in the\r\ncarpet. Like a jolly old tiger at the Zoo at feeding time. Wouldn’t be\r\nsurprised at any moment to look down and find him biting a piece out of\r\nmy leg!”\r\n\r\nJill seized his arm and shook it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t _ramble_, Freddie! Tell me how you got here.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that was pretty simple. I had a letter of introduction to this\r\nchappie Pilkington who’s running this show, and, we having got\r\ntolerably pally in the last few days, I went to him and asked him to\r\nlet me join the merry throng. I said I didn’t want any money and the\r\nlittle bit of work I would do wouldn’t make any difference, so he said\r\n‘Right ho!’ or words to that effect, and here I am.”\r\n\r\n“But why? You can’t be doing this for fun, surely?”\r\n\r\n“Fun!” A pained expression came into Freddie’s face. “My idea of fun\r\nisn’t anything in which jolly old Miller, the bird with the snowy hair,\r\nis permitted to mix. Something tells me that that lad is going to make\r\nit his life-work picking on me. No, I didn’t do this for fun. I had a\r\ntalk with Wally Mason the night before last, and he seemed to think\r\nthat being in the chorus wasn’t the sort of thing you ought to be\r\ndoing, so I thought it over and decided that I ought to join the troupe\r\ntoo. Then I could always be on the spot, don’t you know, if there was\r\nany trouble. I mean to say, I’m not much of a chap and all that sort of\r\nthing, but still I might come in handy one of these times. Keep a\r\nfatherly eye on you, don’t you know, and what not!”\r\n\r\nJill was touched.\r\n\r\n“You’re a dear, Freddie!”\r\n\r\n“I thought, don’t you know, it would make poor old Derek a bit easier\r\nin his mind.”\r\n\r\nJill froze.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to talk about Derek, Freddie, please.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know what you must be feeling. Pretty sick, I’ll bet, what? But\r\nif you could see him now …”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to talk about him!”\r\n\r\n“He’s pretty cut up, you know. Regrets bitterly and all that sort of\r\nthing. He wants you to come back again.”\r\n\r\n“I see! He sent you to fetch me?”\r\n\r\n“That was more or less the idea.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a shame that you had all the trouble. You can get messenger-boys\r\nto go anywhere and do anything nowadays. Derek ought to have thought of\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nFreddie looked at her doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“You’re spoofing, aren’t you? I mean to say, you wouldn’t have liked\r\nthat!”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t have disliked it any more than his sending you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I wanted to pop over. Keen to see America and so forth.”\r\n\r\nJill looked past him at the gloomy stage. Her face was set, and her\r\neyes sombre.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you understand, Freddie? You’ve known me a long time. I should\r\nhave thought that you would have found out by now that I have a certain\r\namount of pride. If Derek wanted me back, there was only one thing for\r\nhim to do—come over and find me himself.”\r\n\r\n“Rummy! That’s what Mason said, when I told him. You two don’t realize\r\nhow dashed busy Derek is these days.”\r\n\r\n“Busy!”\r\n\r\nSomething in her face seemed to tell Freddie that he was not saying the\r\nright thing, but he stumbled on.\r\n\r\n“You’ve no notion how busy he is. I mean to say, elections coming on\r\nand so forth. He daren’t stir from the metrop.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I couldn’t expect him to do anything that might interfere\r\nwith his career, could I?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely not. I knew you would see it!” said Freddie, charmed at her\r\nreasonableness. All rot, what you read about women being unreasonable.\r\n“Then I take it it’s all right, eh?”\r\n\r\n“All right?”\r\n\r\n“I mean you will toddle home with me at the earliest opp. and make poor\r\nold Derek happy?”\r\n\r\nJill laughed discordantly.\r\n\r\n“Poor old Derek!” she echoed. “He has been badly treated, hasn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I wouldn’t say that,” said Freddie doubtfully. “You see, coming\r\ndown to it, the thing was more or less his fault, what?”\r\n\r\n“More or less!”\r\n\r\n“I mean to say …”\r\n\r\n“More or less!”\r\n\r\nFreddie glanced at her anxiously. He was not at all sure now that he\r\nliked the way she was looking or the tone in which she spoke. He was\r\nnot a keenly observant young man, but there did begin at this point to\r\nseep through to his brain-centers a suspicion that all was not well.\r\n\r\n“Let me pull myself together!” said Freddie warily to his immortal\r\nsoul. “I believe I’m getting the raspberry!” And there was silence for\r\na space.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of life began to weigh upon Freddie. Life was like one\r\nof those shots at squash which seem so simple till you go to knock the\r\ncover off the ball, when the ball sort of edges away from you and you\r\nmiss it. Life, Freddie began to perceive, was apt to have a nasty\r\nback-spin on it. He had never had any doubt when he had started, that\r\nthe only difficult part of his expedition to America would be the\r\nfinding of Jill. Once found, he had presumed that she would be\r\ndelighted to hear his good news and would joyfully accompany him home\r\non the next boat. It appeared now, however, that he had been too\r\nsanguine. Optimist as he was, he had to admit that, as far as could be\r\nascertained with the naked eye, the jolly old binge might be said to\r\nhave sprung a leak.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to approach the matter from another angle.\r\n\r\n“I say!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“You do love old Derek, don’t you? I mean to say, you know what I mean,\r\n_love_ him and all that sort of rot?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know! Oh, I say, come now! You must _know!_ Pull up your\r\nsocks, old thing … I mean, pull yourself together! You either love a\r\nchappie or you don’t.”\r\n\r\nJill smiled painfully.\r\n\r\n“How nice it would be if everything were as simple and straightforward\r\nas that. Haven’t you ever heard that the dividing line between love and\r\nhate is just a thread? Poets have said so a great number of times.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, poets!” said Freddie, dismissing the genus with a wave of the\r\nhand. He had been compelled to read Shakespeare and all that sort of\r\nthing at school, but it had left him cold, and since growing to man’s\r\nestate he had rather handed the race of bards the mitten. He liked Doss\r\nChiderdoss’ stuff in the _Sporting Times_, but beyond that he was not\r\nmuch of a lad for poets.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you understand a girl in my position not being able to make up\r\nher mind whether she loves a man or despises him?”\r\n\r\nFreddie shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “It sounds dashed silly to me!”\r\n\r\n“Then what’s the good of talking?” cried Jill. “It only hurts.”\r\n\r\n“But—won’t you come back to England?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say! Be a sport! Take a stab at it!”\r\n\r\nJill laughed again—another of those grating laughs which afflicted\r\nFreddie with a sense of foreboding and failure. Something had\r\nundoubtedly gone wrong with the works. He began to fear that at some\r\npoint in the conversation—just where he could not say—he had been less\r\ndiplomatic than he might have been.\r\n\r\n“You speak as if you were inviting me to a garden-party! No, I won’t\r\ntake a stab at it. You’ve a lot to learn about women, Freddie!”\r\n\r\n“Women _are_ rum!” conceded that perplexed ambassador.\r\n\r\nJill began to move away.\r\n\r\n“Don’t go!” urged Freddie.\r\n\r\n“Why not? What’s the use of talking any more? Have you ever broken an\r\narm or a leg, Freddie?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Freddie, mystified. “As a matter of fact, my last year at\r\nOxford, playing soccer for the college in a friendly game, some\r\nblighter barged into me and I came down on my wrist. But …”\r\n\r\n“It hurt?”\r\n\r\n“Like the deuce!”\r\n\r\n“And then it began to get better, I suppose. Well, used you to hit it\r\nand twist it and prod it, or did you leave it alone to try and heal? I\r\nwon’t talk any more about Derek! I simply won’t! I’m all smashed up\r\ninside, and I don’t know if I’m ever going to get well again, but at\r\nleast I’m going to give myself a chance. I’m working as hard as ever I\r\ncan, and I’m forcing myself not to think of him. I’m in a sling,\r\nFreddie, like your wrist, and I don’t want to be prodded. I hope we\r\nshall see a lot of each other while you’re over here—you always were\r\nthe greatest dear in the world—but you mustn’t mention Derek again, and\r\nyou mustn’t ask me to go home. If you avoid those subjects, we’ll be as\r\nhappy as possible. And now I’m going to leave you to talk to poor\r\nNelly. She has been hovering round for the last ten minutes, waiting\r\nfor a chance to speak to you. She worships you, you know!”\r\n\r\nFreddie started violently.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say! What rot!”\r\n\r\nJill had gone, and he was still gaping after her, when Nelly Bryant\r\nmoved towards him—shyly, like a worshiper approaching a shrine.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Mr Rooke!” said Nelly.\r\n\r\n“Hullo-ullo-ullo!” said Freddie.\r\n\r\nNelly fixed her large eyes on his face. A fleeting impression passed\r\nthrough Freddie’s mind that she was looking unusually pretty this\r\nmorning: nor was the impression unjustified. Nelly was wearing for the\r\nfirst time a Spring suit which was the outcome of hours of painful\r\nselection among the wares of a dozen different stores, and the\r\nknowledge that the suit was just right seemed to glow from her like an\r\ninner light. She felt happy: and her happiness had lent an unwonted\r\ncolor to her face and a soft brightness to her eyes.\r\n\r\n“How nice it is, your being here!”\r\n\r\nFreddie waited for the inevitable question, the question with which\r\nJill had opened their conversation; but it did not come. He was\r\nsurprised, but relieved. He hated long explanations, and he was very\r\ndoubtful whether loyalty to Jill could allow him to give them to Nelly.\r\nHis reason for being where he was had to do so intimately with Jill’s\r\nmost private affairs. A wave of gratitude to Nelly swept through him\r\nwhen he realised that she was either incurious or else too\r\ndelicate-minded to show inquisitiveness.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it was delicacy that kept Nelly silent. Seeing\r\nFreddie here at the theatre, she had, as is not uncommon with fallible\r\nmortals, put two and two together and made the answer four when it was\r\nnot four at all. She had been deceived by circumstantial evidence.\r\nJill, whom she had left in England wealthy and secure, she had met\r\nagain in New York penniless as the result of some Stock Exchange\r\ncataclysm in which, she remembered with the vagueness with which one\r\nrecalls once-heard pieces of information, Freddie Rooke had been\r\ninvolved. True, she seemed to recollect hearing that Freddie’s losses\r\nhad been comparatively slight, but his presence in the chorus of “The\r\nRose of America” seemed to her proof that after all they must have been\r\ndevastating. She could think of no other reason except loss of money\r\nwhich could have placed Freddie in the position in which she now found\r\nhim, so she accepted it; and, with the delicacy which was innate in her\r\nand which a hard life had never blunted, decided, directly she saw him,\r\nto make no allusion to the disaster.\r\n\r\nSuch was Nelly’s view of the matter, and sympathy gave to her manner a\r\nkind of maternal gentleness which acted on Freddie, raw from his late\r\nencounter with Mr Johnson Miller and disturbed by Jill’s attitude in\r\nthe matter of poor old Derek, like a healing balm. His emotions were\r\ntoo chaotic for analysis, but one thing stood out clear from the\r\nwelter—the fact that he was glad to be with Nelly as he had never been\r\nglad to be with a girl before, and found her soothing as he had never\r\nsupposed a girl could be soothing.\r\n\r\nThey talked desultorily of unimportant things, and every minute found\r\nFreddie more convinced that Nelly was not as other girls. He felt that\r\nhe must see more of her.\r\n\r\n“I say,” he said. “When this binge is over … when the rehearsal\r\nfinishes, you know, how about a bite to eat?”\r\n\r\n“I should love it. I generally go to the Automat.”\r\n\r\n“The how-much? Never heard of it.”\r\n\r\n“In Times Square. It’s cheap, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking of the Cosmopolis.”\r\n\r\n“But that’s so expensive.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know. Much the same as any of the other places, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nNelly’s manner became more motherly than ever. She bent forward and\r\ntouched his arm affectionately.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t to keep up any front with me,” she said gently. “I don’t\r\ncare whether you’re rich or poor or what. I mean, of course I’m awfully\r\nsorry you’ve lost your money, but it makes it all the easier for us to\r\nbe real pals, don’t you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Lost my money!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I know you wouldn’t be here if you hadn’t. I wasn’t going to say\r\nanything about it, but, when you talked of the Cosmopolis, I just had\r\nto. You lost your money in the same thing Jill Mariner lost hers,\r\ndidn’t you? I was sure you had, the moment I saw you here. Who cares?\r\nMoney isn’t everything!”\r\n\r\nAstonishment kept Freddie silent for an instant: after that he\r\nrefrained from explanations of his own free will. He accepted the\r\nsituation and rejoiced in it. Like many other wealthy and modest young\r\nmen, he had always had a sneaking suspicion at the back of his mind\r\nthat any girl who was decently civil to him was so from mixed\r\nmotives—or more likely, motives that were not even mixed. Well, dash\r\nit, here was a girl who seemed to like him although under the\r\nimpression that he was broke to the wide. It was an intoxicating\r\nexperience. It made him feel a better chap. It fortified his\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\n“You know,” he said, stammering a little, for he found a sudden\r\ndifficulty in controlling his voice. “You’re a dashed good sort!”\r\n\r\n“I’m awfully glad you think so.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence—as far, at least, as he and she were concerned. In\r\nthe outer world, beyond the piece of scenery under whose shelter they\r\nstood, stirring things, loud and exciting things, seemed to be\r\nhappening. Some sort of an argument appeared to be in progress. The\r\nrasping voice of Mr Goble was making itself heard from the unseen\r\nauditorium. These things they sensed vaguely, but they were too\r\noccupied with each other to ascertain details.\r\n\r\n“What was the name of that place again?” asked Freddie. “The\r\nwhat-ho-something?”\r\n\r\n“The Automat?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the little chap! We’ll go there, shall we?”\r\n\r\n“The food’s quite good. You go and help yourself out of slot-machines,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\n“My favorite indoor sport!” said Freddie with enthusiasm. “Hullo!\r\nWhat’s up? It sounds as if there were dirty work at the cross-roads!”\r\n\r\nThe voice of the assistant stage-manager was calling—sharply excited,\r\nagitation in every syllable.\r\n\r\n“All the gentlemen of the chorus on the stage, please! Mr Goble wants\r\nall the chorus—gentlemen on the stage!”\r\n\r\n“Well, cheerio for the present,” said Freddie. “I suppose I’d better\r\nlook into this.” He made his way onto the stage.\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nThere is an insidious something about the atmosphere of a rehearsal of\r\na musical play which saps the finer feelings of those connected with\r\nit. Softened by the gentle beauty of the Spring weather, Mr Goble had\r\ncome to the Gotham Theatre that morning in an excellent temper, firmly\r\nintending to remain in an excellent temper all day. Five minutes of\r\n“The Rose of America” had sent him back to the normal: and at ten\r\nminutes past eleven he was chewing his cigar and glowering at the stage\r\nwith all the sweetness gone from his soul. When Wally Mason arrived at\r\na quarter past eleven and dropped into the seat beside him, the manager\r\nreceived him with a grunt and even omitted to offer him a cigar. And\r\nwhen a New York theatrical manager does that, it is a certain sign that\r\nhis mood is of the worst.\r\n\r\nOne may find excuses for Mr Goble. “The Rose of America” would have\r\ntested the equanimity of a far more amiable man: and on Mr Goble what\r\nOtis Pilkington had called its delicate whimsicality jarred profoundly.\r\nHe had been brought up in the lower-browed school of musical comedy,\r\nwhere you shelved the plot after the opening number and filled in the\r\nrest of the evening by bringing on the girls in a variety of exotic\r\ncostumes, with some good vaudeville specialists to get the laughs. Mr\r\nGoble’s idea of a musical piece was something embracing trained seals,\r\nacrobats, and two or three teams of skilled buck-and-wing dancers, with\r\nnothing on the stage, from a tree to a lamp-shade, which could not\r\nsuddenly turn into a chorus-girl. The austere legitimateness of “The\r\nRose of America” gave him a pain in the neck. He loathed plot, and “The\r\nRose of America” was all plot.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, had the earthy Mr. Goble consented to associate himself with\r\nthe production of this intellectual play? Because he was subject, like\r\nall other New York managers, to intermittent spasms of the idea that\r\nthe time is ripe for a revival of comic opera. Sometimes, lunching in\r\nhis favorite corner in the Cosmopolis grill-room, he would lean across\r\nthe table and beg some other manager to take it from him that the time\r\nwas ripe for a revival of comic opera—or more cautiously, that pretty\r\nsoon the time was going to be ripe for a revival of comic opera. And\r\nthe other manager would nod his head and thoughtfully stroke his three\r\nchins and admit that, sure as God made little apples, the time was\r\ndarned soon going to be ripe for a revival of comic opera. And then\r\nthey would stuff themselves with rich food and light big cigars and\r\nbrood meditatively.\r\n\r\nWith most managers these spasms, which may be compared to twinges of\r\nconscience, pass as quickly as they come, and they go back to coining\r\nmoney with rowdy musical comedies, quite contented. But Otis\r\nPilkington, happening along with the script of “The Rose of America”\r\nand the cash to back it, had caught Mr Goble in the full grip of an\r\nattack, and all the arrangements had been made before the latter\r\nemerged from the influence. He now regretted his rash act.\r\n\r\n“Say, listen,” he said to Wally, his gaze on the stage, his words\r\nproceeding from the corner of his mouth, “you’ve got to stick around\r\nwith this show after it opens on the road. We’ll talk terms later. But\r\nwe’ve got to get it right, don’t care what it costs. See?”\r\n\r\n“You think it will need fixing?”\r\n\r\nMr Goble scowled at the unconscious artists, who were now going through\r\na particularly arid stretch of dialogue.\r\n\r\n“Fixing! It’s all wrong! It don’t add up right! You’ll have to rewrite\r\nit from end to end.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve got some ideas about it. I saw it played by amateurs last\r\nsummer, you know. I could make a quick job of it, if you want me to.\r\nBut will the author stand for it?”\r\n\r\nMr Goble allowed a belligerent eye to stray from the stage, and twisted\r\nit round in Wally’s direction.\r\n\r\n“Say, listen! He’ll stand for anything I say. I’m the little guy that\r\ngives orders round here. I’m the big noise!”\r\n\r\nAs if in support of this statement he suddenly emitted a terrific\r\nbellow. The effect was magical. The refined and painstaking artists on\r\nthe stage stopped as if they had been shot. The assistant\r\nstage-director bent sedulously over the footlights, which had now been\r\nturned up, shading his eyes with the prompt script.\r\n\r\n“Take that over again!” shouted Mr Goble. “Yes, that speech about life\r\nbeing like a water-melon. It don’t sound to me as though it meant\r\nanything.” He cocked his cigar at an angle, and listened fiercely. He\r\nclapped his hands. The action stopped again. “Cut it!” said Mr Goble\r\ntersely.\r\n\r\n“Cut the speech, Mr Goble?” queried the obsequious assistant\r\nstage-director.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Cut it. It don’t mean nothing!”\r\n\r\nDown the aisle, springing from a seat at the back, shimmered Mr\r\nPilkington, wounded to the quick.\r\n\r\n“Mr Goble! Mr Goble!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“That is the best epigram in the play.”\r\n\r\n“The best what?”\r\n\r\n“Epigram. The best epigram in the play.”\r\n\r\nMr. Goble knocked the ash off his cigar. “The public don’t want\r\nepigrams. The public don’t like epigrams. I’ve been in the show\r\nbusiness fifteen years, and I’m telling you! Epigrams give them a pain\r\nunder the vest. All right, get on.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington fluttered agitatedly. This was his first experience of Mr\r\nGoble in the capacity of stage-director. It was the latter’s custom to\r\nleave the early rehearsals of the pieces with which he was connected to\r\na subordinate producer, who did what Mr Goble called the breaking-in.\r\nThis accomplished, he would appear in person, undo most of the other’s\r\nwork, make cuts, tell the actors how to read their lines, and generally\r\nenjoy himself. Producing plays was Mr Goble’s hobby. He imagined\r\nhimself to have a genius in that direction, and it was useless to try\r\nto induce him to alter any decision to which he might have come. He\r\nregarded those who did not agree with him with the lofty contempt of an\r\nEastern despot.\r\n\r\nOf this Mr Pilkington was not yet aware.\r\n\r\n“But, Mr Goble … !”\r\n\r\nThe potentate swung irritably round on him.\r\n\r\n“What is it? What _is_ it? Can’t you see I’m busy?”\r\n\r\n“That epigram …”\r\n\r\n“It’s out!”\r\n\r\n“But … !”\r\n\r\n“It’s out!”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” protested Mr Pilkington almost tearfully, “I have a voice …”\r\n\r\n“Sure you have a voice,” retorted Mr Goble, “and you can use it any old\r\nplace you want, except in my theatre. Have all the voice you like! Go\r\nround the corner and talk to yourself! Sing in your bath! But don’t\r\ncome using it here, because I’m the little guy that does all the\r\ntalking in this theatre! That fellow gets my goat,” he added\r\ncomplainingly to Wally, as Mr Pilkington withdrew like a foiled python.\r\n“He don’t know nothing about the show business, and he keeps butting in\r\nand making fool suggestions. He ought to be darned glad he’s getting\r\nhis first play produced and not trying to teach me how to direct it.”\r\nHe clapped his hands imperiously. The assistant stage-manager bent over\r\nthe footlights. “What was that that guy said? Lord Finchley’s last\r\nspeech. Take it again.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who was playing the part of Lord Finchley, an English\r\ncharacter actor who specialized in London “nuts,” raised his eyebrows,\r\nannoyed. Like Mr Pilkington, he had never before come into contact with\r\nMr Goble as stage-director, and, accustomed to the suaver methods of\r\nhis native land, he was finding the experience trying. He had not yet\r\nrecovered from the agony of having that water-melon line cut out of his\r\npart. It was the only good line, he considered, that he had. Any line\r\nthat is cut out of an actor’s part is always the only good line he has.\r\n\r\n“The speech about Omar Khayyam?” he enquired with suppressed\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n“I thought that was the way you said it. All wrong! It’s Omar _of_\r\nKhayyam.”\r\n\r\n“I think you will find that Omar Khayyam is the—ah—generally accepted\r\nversion of the poet’s name,” said the portrayer of Lord Finchley,\r\nadding beneath his breath. “You silly ass!”\r\n\r\n“You say Omar _of_ Khayyam,” bellowed Mr Goble. “Who’s running this\r\nshow, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Just as you please.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble turned to Wally.\r\n\r\n“These actors …” he began, when Mr Pilkington appeared again at his\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n“Mr Goble! Mr Goble!”\r\n\r\n“What is it _now?_”\r\n\r\n“Omar Khayyam was a Persian poet. His name was Khayyam.”\r\n\r\n“That wasn’t the way _I_ heard it,” said Mr Goble doggedly. “Did\r\n_you?_” he enquired of Wally. “I thought he was born at Khayyam.”\r\n\r\n“You’re probably quite right,” said Wally, “but, if so, everybody else\r\nhas been wrong for a good many years. It’s usually supposed that the\r\ngentleman’s name was Omar Khayyam. Khayyam, Omar J. Born 1050 A.D.,\r\neducated privately and at Bagdad University. Represented Persia in the\r\nOlympic Games of 1072, winning the sitting high-jump and the\r\negg-and-spoon race. The Khayyams were quite a well-known family in\r\nBagdad, and there was a lot of talk when Omar, who was Mrs Khayyam’s\r\npet son, took to drink and writing poetry. They had had it all fixed\r\nfor him to go into his father’s date business.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble was impressed. He had a respect for Wally’s opinion, for Wally\r\nhad written “Follow the Girl” and look what a knock-out that had been.\r\nHe stopped the rehearsal again.\r\n\r\n“Go back to that Khayyam speech!” he said, interrupting Lord Finchley\r\nin mid-sentence.\r\n\r\nThe actor whispered a hearty English oath beneath his breath. He had\r\nbeen up late last night, and, in spite of the fair weather, he was\r\nfeeling a trifle on edge.\r\n\r\n“‘In the words of Omar of Khayyam’…”\r\n\r\nMr Goble clapped his hands.\r\n\r\n“Cut that ‘of,’” he said. “The show’s too long, anyway.”\r\n\r\nAnd, having handled a delicate matter in masterly fashion, he leaned\r\nback in his chair and chewed the end off another cigar.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes after this the rehearsal proceeded smoothly. If Mr\r\nGoble did not enjoy the play, at least he made no criticisms except to\r\nWally. To him he enlarged from time to time on the pain which “The Rose\r\nof America” caused him.\r\n\r\n“How I ever came to put on junk like this beats me,” confessed Mr Goble\r\nfrankly.\r\n\r\n“You probably saw that there was a good idea at the back of it,”\r\nsuggested Wally. “There is, you know. Properly handled, it’s an idea\r\nthat could be made into a success.”\r\n\r\n“What would you do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a lot of things,” said Wally warily. In his younger and callower\r\ndays he had sometimes been rash enough to scatter views on the\r\nreconstruction of plays broadcast, to find them gratefully absorbed and\r\nacted upon and treated as a friendly gift. His affection for Mr Goble\r\nwas not so overpowering as to cause him to give him ideas for nothing\r\nnow. “Any time you want me to fix it for you, I’ll come along. About\r\none and a half per cent of the gross would meet the case, I think.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble faced him, registering the utmost astonishment and horror.\r\n\r\n“One and a half per cent for fixing a show like this? Why, darn it,\r\nthere’s hardly anything to do to it! It’s—it’s—in!”\r\n\r\n“You called it junk just now.”\r\n\r\n“Well, all I meant was that it wasn’t the sort of thing I cared for\r\nmyself. The public will eat it! Take it from me, the time is just about\r\nripe for a revival of comic opera.”\r\n\r\n“This one will want all the reviving you can give it. Better use a\r\npulmotor.”\r\n\r\n“But that long boob, that Pilkington … he would never stand for my\r\nhanding you one and a half per cent.”\r\n\r\n“I thought _you_ were the little guy who arranged things round here.”\r\n\r\n“But he’s got money in the show.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if he wants to get any out, he’d better call in somebody to\r\nrewrite it. You don’t have to engage me if you don’t want to. But I\r\nknow I could make a good job of it. There’s just one little twist the\r\nthing needs and you would have quite a different piece.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” enquired Mr Goble casually.\r\n\r\n“Oh, just a little … what shall I say?… a little touch of\r\nwhat-d’you-call-it and a bit of thingummy. You know the sort of thing!\r\nThat’s all it wants.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble gnawed his cigar, baffled.\r\n\r\n“You think so, eh?” he said at length.\r\n\r\n“And perhaps a suspicion of je-ne-sais-quoi,” added Wally.\r\n\r\nMr Goble worried his cigar, and essayed a new form of attack.\r\n\r\n“You’ve done a lot of work for me,” he said. “Good work!”\r\n\r\n“Glad you liked it,” said Wally.\r\n\r\n“You’re a good kid! I like having you around. I was half thinking of\r\ngiving you a show to do this Fall. Corking book. French farce. Ran two\r\nyears in Paris. But what’s the good, if you want the earth?”\r\n\r\n“Always useful, the earth. Good thing to have.”\r\n\r\n“See here, if you’ll fix up this show for half of one per cent, I’ll\r\ngive you the other to do.”\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t slur your words so. For a moment I thought you said\r\n‘half of one per cent.’ One and a half of course you really said.”\r\n\r\n“If you won’t take half, you don’t get the other.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Wally. “There are lots of other managers in New York.\r\nHaven’t you seen them popping about? Rich, enterprising men, and all of\r\nthem love me like a son.”\r\n\r\n“Make it one per cent,” said Mr Goble, “and I’ll see if I can fix it\r\nwith Pilkington.”\r\n\r\n“One and a half.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn it, one and a half, then,” said Mr Goble morosely. “What’s\r\nthe good of splitting straws?”\r\n\r\n“Forgotten Sports of the Past—Splitting the Straw. All right. If you\r\ndrop me a line to that effect, legibly signed with your name, I’ll wear\r\nit next my heart. I shall have to go now. I have a date. Good-bye. Glad\r\neverything’s settled and everybody’s happy.”\r\n\r\nFor some moments after Wally had left, Mr Goble sat hunched up in his\r\norchestra-chair, smoking sullenly, his mood less sunny than ever.\r\nLiving in a little world of sycophants, he was galled by the off-hand\r\nway in which Wally always treated him. There was something in the\r\nlatter’s manner which seemed to him sometimes almost contemptuous. He\r\nregretted the necessity of having to employ him. There was, of course,\r\nno real necessity why he should have employed Wally. New York was full\r\nof librettists who would have done the work equally well for half the\r\nmoney, but, like most managers, Mr Goble had the mental processes of a\r\nsheep. “Follow the Girl” was the last outstanding musical success in\r\nNew York theatrical history: Wally had written it: therefore nobody but\r\nWally was capable of rewriting “The Rose of America.” The thing had for\r\nMr Goble the inevitability of Fate. Except for deciding mentally that\r\nWally had swelled head, there was nothing to be done.\r\n\r\nHaving decided that Wally had swelled head and not feeling much better,\r\nMr Goble concentrated his attention on the stage. A good deal of action\r\nhad taken place there during recently concluded business talk, and the\r\nunfortunate Finchley was back again, playing another of his scenes. Mr\r\nGoble glared at Lord Finchley. He did not like him, and he did not like\r\nthe way he was speaking his lines.\r\n\r\nThe part of Lord Finchley was a non-singing role. It was a type part.\r\nOtis Pilkington had gone to the straight stage to find an artist, and\r\nhad secured the not uncelebrated Wentworth Hill, who had come over from\r\nLondon to play in an English comedy which had just closed. The\r\nnewspapers had called the play thin, but had thought that Wentworth\r\nHill was an excellent comedian. Mr Hill thought so too, and it was\r\nconsequently a shock to his already disordered nerves when a bellow\r\nfrom the auditorium stopped him in the middle of one of his speeches\r\nand a rasping voice informed him that he was doing it all wrong.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?” said Mr. Hill, quietly but dangerously, stepping\r\nto the footlights.\r\n\r\n“All wrong!” repeated Mr Goble.\r\n\r\n“Really?” Wentworth Hill, who a few years earlier had spent several\r\nterms at Oxford University before being sent down for aggravated\r\ndisorderliness, had brought little away with him from that seat of\r\nlearning except the Oxford manner. This he now employed upon Mr Goble\r\nwith an icy severity which put the last touch to the manager’s\r\nfermenting state of mind. “Perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me\r\njust how you think that part should be played?”\r\n\r\nMr Goble marched down the aisle.\r\n\r\n“Speak out to the audience,” he said, stationing himself by the\r\norchestra pit. “You’re turning your head away all the darned time.”\r\n\r\n“I may be wrong,” said Mr Hill, “but I have played a certain amount,\r\ndon’t you know, in pretty good companies, and I was always under the\r\nimpression that one should address one’s remarks to the person one was\r\nspeaking to, not deliver a recitation to the gallery. I was taught that\r\nthat was the legitimate method.”\r\n\r\nThe word touched off all the dynamite in Mr Goble. Of all things in the\r\ntheatre he detested most the “legitimate method.” His idea of producing\r\nwas to instruct the cast to come down to the footlights and hand it to\r\n’em. These people who looked up stage and talked to the audience\r\nthrough the backs of their necks revolted him.\r\n\r\n“Legitimate! That’s a hell of a thing to be! Where do you get that\r\nlegitimate stuff? You aren’t playing Ibsen!”\r\n\r\n“Nor am I playing a knockabout vaudeville sketch.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk back at me!”\r\n\r\n“Kindly don’t shout at _me!_ Your voice is unpleasant enough without\r\nyour raising it.”\r\n\r\nOpen defiance was a thing which Mr Goble had never encountered before,\r\nand for a moment it deprived him of breath. He recovered it, however,\r\nalmost immediately.\r\n\r\n“You’re fired!”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said Mr Hill, “I’m resigning.” He drew a\r\ngreen-covered script from his pocket and handed it with an air to the\r\npallid assistant stage-director. Then, more gracefully than ever\r\nFreddie Rooke had managed to move downstage under the tuition of\r\nJohnson Miller, he moved upstage to the exit. “I trust that you will be\r\nable to find someone who will play the part according to your ideas!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll find,” bellowed Mr Goble at his vanishing back, “a chorus-man\r\nwho’ll play it a damned sight better than you!” He waved to the\r\nassistant stage-director. “Send the chorus-men on the stage!”\r\n\r\n“All the gentlemen of the chorus on the stage, please!” shrilled the\r\nassistant stage-director, bounding into the wings like a retriever.\r\n\r\n“Mr Goble wants all the chorus-gentlemen on the stage!”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment, when the seven male members of “The Rose of\r\nAmerica” ensemble lined up self-consciously before his gleaming eyes,\r\nwhen Mr Goble repented of his brave words. An uncomfortable feeling\r\npassed across his mind that Fate had called his bluff and that he would\r\nnot be able to make good. All chorus-men are exactly alike, and they\r\nare like nothing else on earth. Even Mr Goble, anxious as he was to\r\noverlook their deficiencies, could not persuade himself that in their\r\nranks stood even an adequate Lord Finchley. And then, just as a cold\r\nreaction from his fervid mood was about to set in, he perceived that\r\nProvidence had been good to him. There, at the extreme end of the line,\r\nstood a young man who, as far as appearance went, was the ideal Lord\r\nFinchley,—as far as appearance went, a far better Lord Finchley than\r\nthe late Mr Hill. He beckoned imperiously.\r\n\r\n“You at the end!”\r\n\r\n“Me?” said the young man.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you. What’s your name?”\r\n\r\n“Rooke. Frederick Rooke, don’t you know.”\r\n\r\n“You’re English, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Eh? Oh, yes, absolutely!”\r\n\r\n“Ever played a part before?”\r\n\r\n“Part? Oh, I see what you mean. Well, in amateur theatricals, you know,\r\nand all that sort of rot.”\r\n\r\nHis words were music to Mr Goble’s ears. He felt that his Napoleonic\r\naction had justified itself by success. His fury left him. If he had\r\nbeen capable of beaming, one would have said that he beamed at Freddie.\r\n\r\n“Well, you play the part of Lord Finchley from now on. Come to my\r\noffice this afternoon for your contract. Clear the stage. We’ve wasted\r\nenough time.”\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, in the wings, Freddie, receiving congratulations\r\nfrom Nelly Bryant, asserted himself.\r\n\r\n“_Not_ the Automat today, I _think_, what! Now that I’m a jolly old\r\nstar and all that sort of thing, it can’t be done. Directly this is\r\nover we’ll roll round to the Cosmopolis. A slight celebration is\r\nindicated, what? Right ho! Rally round, dear heart, rally round!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nThe lobby of the Hotel Cosmopolis is the exact center of New York, the\r\nspot where at certain hours one is sure of meeting everybody one knows.\r\nThe first person that Nelly and Freddie saw, as they passed through the\r\nswing doors, was Jill. She was seated on the chair by the big pillar in\r\nthe middle of the hall.\r\n\r\n“What ho!” said Freddie. “Waiting for someone?”\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Freddie. Yes, I’m waiting for Wally Mason. I got a note from\r\nhim this morning, asking me to meet him here. I’m a little early. I\r\nhaven’t congratulated you yet. You’re wonderful!”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, old girl. Our young hero _is_ making pretty hefty strides in\r\nhis chosen profesh, what! Mr Rooke, who appears quite simple and\r\nunspoiled by success, replied to our representative’s enquiry as to his\r\nfuture plans that he proposed to stagger into the grill-room and imbibe\r\nabout eighteen dollars’ worth of lunch. Yes, it _is_ a bit of all\r\nright, taking it by and large, isn’t it? I mean to say, the salary, the\r\njolly old salary, you know … quite a help when a fellow’s lost all his\r\nmoney!”\r\n\r\nJill was surprised to observe that the Last of the Rookes was\r\ncontorting his face in an unsightly manner that seemed to be an attempt\r\nat a wink, pregnant with hidden meaning. She took her cue dutifully,\r\nthough without understanding.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” she replied.\r\n\r\nFreddie seemed grateful. With a cordial “Cheerio!” he led Nelly off to\r\nthe grill-room.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know Jill knew Mr Mason,” said Nelly, as they sat down at\r\ntheir table.\r\n\r\n“No?” said Freddie absently, running an experienced eye over the\r\nbill-of-fare. He gave an elaborate order. “What was that? Oh,\r\nabsolutely! Jill and I and Wally were children together.”\r\n\r\n“How funny you should all be together again like this.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Oh, good Lord!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing. I meant to send a cable to a pal of mine in England.\r\nI’ll send it after lunch.”\r\n\r\nFreddie took out his handkerchief, and tied a knot in it. He was\r\nslightly ashamed of the necessity of taking such a precaution, but it\r\nwas better to be on the safe side. His interview with Jill at the\r\ntheatre had left him with the conviction that there was only one thing\r\nfor him to do, and that was to cable poor old Derek to forget impending\r\nelections and all the rest of it and pop over to America at once. He\r\nknew that he would never have the courage to re-open the matter with\r\nJill himself. As an ambassador he was a spent force. If Jill was to be\r\nwooed from her mood of intractability, Derek was the only man to do it.\r\nFreddie was convinced that, seeing him in person, she would melt and\r\nfall into his arms. Too dashed absurd, Freddie felt, two loving hearts\r\nbeing separated like this and all that sort of thing. He replaced his\r\nhandkerchief in his pocket, relieved, and concentrated himself on the\r\nentertainment of Nelly. A simple task, for, the longer he was with this\r\ngirl, the easier did it seem to talk to her.\r\n\r\nJill, left alone in the lobby, was finding the moments pass quite\r\npleasantly. She liked watching the people as they came in. One or two\r\nof the girls of the company fluttered in like birds, were swooped upon\r\nby their cavaliers, and fluttered off to the grill-room. The red-headed\r\nBabe passed her with a genial nod, and, shortly after, Lois Denham, the\r\nwillowy recipient of sunbursts from her friend Izzy of the hat-checks,\r\ncame by in company with a sallow, hawk-faced young man with a furtive\r\neye, whom Jill took—correctly—to be Izzy himself. Lois was looking pale\r\nand proud, and from the few words which came to Jill’s ears as they\r\nneared her, seemed to be annoyed at having been kept waiting.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately after this that the swing-doors revolved rather more\r\nviolently than usual, and Mr Goble burst into view.\r\n\r\nThere was a cloud upon Mr Goble’s brow, seeming to indicate that his\r\ngrievance against life had not yet been satisfactorily adjusted: but it\r\npassed as he saw Jill, and he came up to her with what he would\r\nprobably have claimed to be an ingratiating smile.\r\n\r\n“Hello!” said Mr Goble. “All alone?”\r\n\r\nJill was about to say that the condition was merely temporary when the\r\nmanager went on.\r\n\r\n“Come and have a bit of lunch.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much,” said Jill, with the politeness of dislike, “but\r\nI’m waiting for someone.”\r\n\r\n“Chuck him!” advised Mr Goble cordially.\r\n\r\n“No, thanks, I couldn’t, really.”\r\n\r\nThe cloud began to descend again upon Mr Goble’s brow. He was\r\naccustomed to having these invitations of his treated as royal\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\n“Come along!”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid it’s impossible.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble subjected her to a prolonged stare, seemed about to speak,\r\nchanged his mind, and swung off moodily in the direction of the\r\ngrill-room. He was not used to this sort of treatment.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly gone, when Wally appeared.\r\n\r\n“What was he saying to you?” demanded Wally abruptly, without\r\npreliminary greeting.\r\n\r\n“He was asking me to lunch.”\r\n\r\nWally was silent for a moment. His good-natured face wore an unwonted\r\nscowl.\r\n\r\n“He went in there, of course?” he said, pointing to the grill-room.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then let’s go into the other room,” said Wally. He regained his\r\ngood-humor. “It was awfully good of you to come. I didn’t know whether\r\nyou would be able to.”\r\n\r\n“It was very nice of you to invite me.”\r\n\r\nWally grinned.\r\n\r\n“How perfect our manners are! It’s a treat to listen! How did you know\r\nthat that was the one hat in New York I wanted you to wear?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, these things get about. Do you like it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s wonderful. Let’s take this table, shall we?”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nThey sat down. The dim, tapestry-hung room soothed Jill. She was\r\nfeeling a little tired after the rehearsal. At the far end of the room\r\nan orchestra was playing a tune that she remembered and liked. Her mind\r\nwent back to the last occasion on which she and Wally had sat opposite\r\neach other at a restaurant. How long ago it seemed! She returned to the\r\npresent to find Wally speaking to her.\r\n\r\n“You left very suddenly the other night,” said Wally.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want to meet Freddie.”\r\n\r\nWally looked at her commiseratingly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to spoil your lunch,” he said, “but Freddie knows all. He\r\nhas tracked you down. He met Nelly Bryant, whom he seems to have made\r\nfriends with in London, and she told him where you were and what you\r\nwere doing. For a girl who fled at his mere approach the night before\r\nlast, you don’t seem very agitated by the news,” he said, as Jill burst\r\ninto a peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t heard?”\r\n\r\n“Heard what?”\r\n\r\n“Freddie got Mr Pilkington to put him in the chorus of the piece. He\r\nwas rehearsing when I arrived at the theatre this morning, and having a\r\nterrible time with Mr Miller. And, later on, Mr Goble had a quarrel\r\nwith the man who was playing the Englishman, and the man threw up his\r\npart and Mr Goble said he could get any one in the chorus to play it\r\njust as well, and he chose Freddie. So now Freddie is one of the\r\nprincipals, and bursting with pride!”\r\n\r\nWally threw his head back and uttered a roar of appreciation which\r\ncaused a luncher at a neighboring table to drop an oyster which he was\r\npoising in mid-air.\r\n\r\n“Don’t make such a noise!” said Jill severely. “Everyone’s looking at\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I must! It’s the most priceless thing I ever heard. I’ve always\r\nmaintained and I always will maintain that for pure lunacy nothing can\r\ntouch the musical comedy business. There isn’t anything that can’t\r\nhappen in musical comedy. ‘Alice in Wonderland’ is nothing to it.”\r\n\r\n“Have you felt that, too? That’s exactly how I feel. It’s like a\r\nperpetual ‘Mad Hatter’s Tea-Party.’”\r\n\r\n“But what on earth made Freddie join the company at all?”\r\n\r\nA sudden gravity descended upon Jill. The words had reminded her of the\r\nthing which she was perpetually striving to keep out of her thoughts.\r\n\r\n“He said he wanted to be there to keep an eye on me.”\r\n\r\nGravity is infectious. Wally’s smile disappeared. He, too, had been\r\nrecalled to thoughts which were not pleasant.\r\n\r\nWally crumbled his roll. There was a serious expression on his face.\r\n\r\n“Freddie was quite right. I didn’t think he had so much sense.”\r\n\r\n“Freddie was not right,” flared Jill. The recollection of her\r\nconversation with that prominent artist still had the power to fire her\r\nindependent soul. “I’m not a child. I can look after myself. What I do\r\nis my own business.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you’re going to find that your business is several people’s\r\nbusiness. I am interested in it myself. I don’t like your being on the\r\nstage. Now bite my head off!”\r\n\r\n“It’s very kind of you to bother about me …”\r\n\r\n“I said ‘Bite my head off!’ I didn’t say ‘Freeze me!’ I take the\r\nlicense of an old friend who in his time has put worms down your back,\r\nand I repeat—I don’t like your being on the stage.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t have thought you would have been so”—Jill sought for a\r\ndevastating adjective—“so mid-Victorian!”\r\n\r\n“As far as you are concerned, I’m the middest Victorian in existence.\r\nMid is my middle name.” Wally met her indignant gaze squarely.\r\n“I-do-not-like-your-being-on-the-stage! Especially in any company which\r\nIke Goble is running.”\r\n\r\n“Why Mr Goble particularly?”\r\n\r\n“Because he is not the sort of man you ought to be coming in contact\r\nwith.”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t nonsense at all. I suppose you’ve read a lot about the morals\r\nof theatrical managers …”\r\n\r\n“Yes. And it seemed to be exaggerated and silly.”\r\n\r\n“So it is. There’s nothing wrong with most of them. As a general thing,\r\nthey are very decent fellows,—extraordinarily decent if you think of\r\nthe position they are in. I don’t say that in a business way there’s\r\nmuch they won’t try to put over on you. In the theatre, when it comes\r\nto business, everything goes except biting and gouging. ‘There’s never\r\na law of God or man runs north of fifty-three.’ If you alter that to\r\n‘north of Forty-first Street,’ it doesn’t scan as well, but it’s just\r\nas true. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the Golden Rule\r\nis suspended there. You get used to it after you have been in the\r\ntheatre for awhile, and, except for leaving your watch and pocketbook\r\nat home when you have to pay a call on a manager and keeping your face\r\nto him so that he can’t get away with your back collar-stud, you don’t\r\ntake any notice of it. It’s all a game. If a manager swindles you, he\r\nwins the hole and takes the honor. If you foil him, you are one up. In\r\neither case, it makes no difference to the pleasantness of your\r\nrelations. You go on calling him by his first name, and he gives you a\r\ncouple of cigars out of his waistcoat pocket and says you’re a good\r\nkid. There is nothing personal in it. He has probably done his best\r\nfriend out of a few thousand dollars the same morning, and you see them\r\nlunching together after the ceremony as happily as possible. You’ve got\r\nto make allowances for managers. They are the victims of heredity. When\r\na burglar marries a hat-check girl, their offspring goes into the\r\ntheatrical business automatically, and he can’t shake off the early\r\nteaching which he imbibed at his father’s knee. But morals …”\r\n\r\nWally broke off to allow the waiter to place a fried sole before him.\r\nWaiters always select the moment when we are talking our best to\r\nintrude themselves.\r\n\r\n“As regards morals,” resumed Wally, “that is a different matter. Most\r\nmanagers are respectable, middle-aged men with wives and families. They\r\nare in the business to make money, and they don’t want anything else\r\nout of it. The girls in their companies are like so many clerks to\r\nthem, just machines that help to bring the money in. They don’t know\r\nhalf a dozen of them to speak to. But our genial Ike is not like that.”\r\nWally consumed a mouthful of sole. “Ike Goble is a bad citizen. He\r\npaws! He’s a slinker and a prowler and a leerer. He’s a pest and a\r\nworm! He’s fat and soft and flabby. He has a greasy soul, a withered\r\nheart, and an eye like a codfish. Not knocking him, of course!” added\r\nWally magnanimously. “Far be it from me to knock anyone! But, speaking\r\nwith the utmost respect and viewing him in the most favorable light, he\r\nis a combination of tom-cat and the things you see when you turn over a\r\nflat stone! Such are the reasons why I am sorry that you are in his\r\ncompany.”\r\n\r\nJill had listened to this diatribe with a certain uneasiness.\r\n\r\nHer brief encounters with Mr Goble told her that every word was\r\nprobably true. She could still feel the unpleasant sensation of being\r\ninspected by the eye which Wally had compared—quite justly—to that of a\r\ncodfish. But her pride forbade any admission of weakness.\r\n\r\n“I can take care of myself,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I don’t doubt it,” said Wally. “And you could probably take care of\r\nyourself if you fell into a muddy pond. But I shouldn’t like to stand\r\non the bank and watch you doing it. I know what girls in the chorus\r\nhave to go through. Hanging about for hours in draughts, doing nothing,\r\nwhile the principals go through their scenes, and yelled at if they try\r\nto relieve the tedium of captivity with a little light conversation …”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” admitted Jill. “There has been a good lot of that.”\r\n\r\n“There always is. I believe if the stage-carpenter was going to stick a\r\nscrew in a flat, they would call a chorus-rehearsal to watch him do it\r\n… Jill, you must get out of it. It’s no life for you. The work …”\r\n\r\n“I like the work.”\r\n\r\n“While it’s new, perhaps, but …”\r\n\r\nJill interrupted him passionately.\r\n\r\n“Oh, can’t you understand!” she cried. “I want the work. I need it. I\r\nwant something to do, something to occupy my mind. I hate talking about\r\nit, but you know how things are with me. Freddie must have told you.\r\nEven if he didn’t, you must have guessed, meeting me here all alone and\r\nremembering how things were when we last met. You must understand!\r\nHaven’t you ever had a terrible shock or a dreadful disappointment that\r\nseemed to smash up the whole world? And didn’t you find that the only\r\npossible thing to do was to work and work and work as hard as ever you\r\ncould? When I first came to America, I nearly went mad. Uncle Chris\r\nsent me down to a place on Long Island, and I had nothing to do all day\r\nbut think. I couldn’t stand it. I ran away and came to New York and met\r\nNelly Bryant and got this work to do. It saved me. It kept me busy all\r\nday and tired me out and didn’t give me time to think. The harder it\r\nis, the better it suits me. It’s an antidote. I simply wouldn’t give it\r\nup now. As for what you were saying, I must put up with that. The other\r\ngirls do, so why shouldn’t I?”\r\n\r\n“They are toughened to it.”\r\n\r\n“Then I must get toughened to it. What else is there for me to do? I\r\nmust do something.”\r\n\r\n“Marry me!” said Wally, reaching across the table and putting his hand\r\non hers. The light in his eyes lit up his homely face like a lantern.\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of it startled Jill into silence. She snatched her hand\r\naway and drew back, looking at him in wonderment. She was confusedly\r\naware of a babble of sound,—people talking, people laughing, the\r\norchestra playing a lively tune. All her senses seemed to have become\r\nsuddenly more acute. She was intensely alive to small details. Then,\r\nabruptly, the whole world condensed itself into two eyes that were\r\nfastened upon hers,—compelling eyes which she felt a panic desire to\r\navoid.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head away, and looked out into the restaurant. It seemed\r\nincredible that all these people, placidly intent upon their food and\r\ntheir small talk, should not be staring at her, wondering what she was\r\ngoing to say; nudging each other and speculating. Their detachment made\r\nher feel alone and helpless. She was nothing to them and they did not\r\ncare what happened to her, just as she had been nothing to those frozen\r\nmarshes down at Brookport. She was alone in an indifferent world, with\r\nher own problems to settle for herself.\r\n\r\nOther men had asked Jill to marry them,—a full dozen of them, here and\r\nthere in country houses and at London before she had met and loved\r\nDerek Underhill: but nothing that she had had in the way of experience\r\nhad prepared her for Wally. These others had given her time to marshal\r\nher forces, to collect herself, to weigh them thoughtfully in the\r\nbalance. Before speaking, they had signalled their devotion in a\r\nhundred perceptible ways—by their pinkness, their stammering\r\nawkwardness, by the glassy look in their eyes. They had not shot a\r\nproposal at her like a bullet from out of the cover of a conversation\r\nthat had nothing to do with their emotions at all.\r\n\r\nYet, now that the shock of it was dying away, she began to remember\r\nsigns she would have noticed, speeches which ought to have warned her …\r\n\r\n“Wally!” she gasped.\r\n\r\nShe found that he affected her in an entirely different fashion from\r\nthe luckless dozen of those London days. He seemed to matter more, to\r\nbe more important, almost—though she rebelled at the word—more\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n“Let me take you out of it all! You aren’t fit for this sort of life. I\r\ncan’t bear to see you …”\r\n\r\nJill bent forward and touched his hand. He started as though he had\r\nbeen burned. The muscles of his throat were working.\r\n\r\n“Wally, it’s—” She paused for a word. “Kind” was horrible. It would\r\nhave sounded cold, almost supercilious. “Sweet” was the sort of thing\r\nshe could imagine Lois Penham saying to her friend Izzy. She began her\r\nsentence again. “You’re a dear to say that, but …”\r\n\r\nWally laughed chokingly.\r\n\r\n“You think I’m altruistic? I’m not. I’m just as selfish and\r\nself-centered as any other man who wants a thing very badly. I’m as\r\naltruistic as a child crying for the moon. I want you to marry me\r\nbecause I love you, because there never was anybody like you, because\r\nyou’re the whole world, because I always have loved you. I’ve been\r\ndreaming about you for a dozen years, thinking about you, wondering\r\nabout you—wondering where you were, what you were doing, how you\r\nlooked. I used to think that it was just sentimentality, that you\r\nmerely stood for a time of my life when I was happier than I have ever\r\nbeen since. I used to think that you were just a sort of peg on which I\r\nwas hanging a pleasant sentimental regret for days which could never\r\ncome back. You were a memory that seemed to personify all the other\r\nmemories of the best time of my life. You were the goddess of old\r\nassociations. Then I met you in London, and it was different. I wanted\r\nyou—_you!_ I didn’t want you because you recalled old times and were\r\nassociated with dead happiness, I wanted _you!_ I knew I loved you\r\ndirectly you spoke to me at the theatre that night of the fire. I loved\r\nyour voice and your eyes and your smile and your courage. And then you\r\ntold me you were engaged. I might have expected it, but I couldn’t keep\r\nmy jealousy from showing itself, and you snubbed me as I deserved. But\r\nnow … things are different now. Everything’s different, except my\r\nlove.”\r\n\r\nJill turned her face to the wall beside her. A man at the next table, a\r\ncorpulent red-faced man, had begun to stare. He could have heard\r\nnothing, for Wally had spoken in a low voice; but plainly he was aware\r\nthat something more interesting was happening at their table than at\r\nany of the other tables, and he was watching with a bovine\r\ninquisitiveness which affected Jill with a sense of outrage. A moment\r\nbefore, she had resented the indifference of the outer world. Now, this\r\none staring man seemed like a watching multitude. There were tears in\r\nher eyes, and she felt that the red-faced man suspected it.\r\n\r\n“Wally …” Her voice broke. “It’s impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Why? Why, Jill?”\r\n\r\n“Because … Oh, it’s impossible!”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\n“Because …” He seemed to find a difficulty in speaking, “Because of\r\nUnderhill?”\r\n\r\nJill nodded. She felt wretched. The monstrous incongruity of her\r\nsurroundings oppressed her. The orchestra dashed into a rollicking\r\nmelody, which set her foot tapping in spite of herself. At a near-by\r\ntable somebody was shouting with laughter. Two waiters at a\r\nservice-stand were close enough for her to catch snatches of their\r\ntalk. They were arguing about an order of fried potatoes. Once again\r\nher feelings veered round, and she loathed the detachment of the world.\r\nHer heart ached for Wally. She could not look at him, but she knew\r\nexactly what she would see if she did,—honest, pleading eyes searching\r\nher face for something which she could not give.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe table creaked. Wally was leaning further forward. He seemed like\r\nsomething large and pathetic,—a big dog in trouble. She hated to be\r\nhurting him. And all the time her foot tapped accompaniment to the\r\nrag-time tune.\r\n\r\n“But you can’t live all your life with a memory,” said Wally.\r\n\r\nJill turned and faced him. His eyes seemed to leap at her, and they\r\nwere just as she had pictured them.\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand,” she said gently. “You don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“It’s ended. It’s over.”\r\n\r\nJill shook her head.\r\n\r\n“You can’t still love him, after what has happened!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Jill unhappily.\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to bewilder Wally as much as they had bewildered\r\nFreddie.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know!”\r\n\r\nJill shut her eyes tight. Wally quivered. It was a trick she had had as\r\na child. In perplexity, she had always screwed up her eyes just like\r\nthat, as if to shut herself up in herself.\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk for a minute, Wally,” she said. “I want to think.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes opened.\r\n\r\n“It’s like this,” she said. He had seen her look at him exactly the\r\nsame way a hundred times. “I don’t suppose I can make you understand,\r\nbut this is how it is. Suppose you had a room, and it was full of\r\nthings. Furniture. And there wasn’t any space left. You—you couldn’t\r\nput anything else in till you had taken all that out, could you? It\r\nmight not be worth anything, but it would still be there taking up all\r\nthe room.”\r\n\r\nWally nodded.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said. “I see.”\r\n\r\n“My heart’s full, Wally dear. I know it’s just lumber that’s choking it\r\nup, but it’s difficult to get it out. It takes time getting it out. I\r\nput it in, thinking it was wonderful furniture, the most wonderful in\r\nthe world, and—I was cheated. It was just lumber. But it’s there. It’s\r\nstill there. It’s there all the time. And what am I to do?”\r\n\r\nThe orchestra crashed, and was silent. The sudden stillness seemed to\r\nbreak a spell. The world invaded the little island where they sat. A\r\nchattering party of girls and men brushed past them. The waiter,\r\njudging that they had been there long enough, slipped a strip of paper,\r\ndecorously turned upside down, in front of Wally. He took the money,\r\nand went away to get change.\r\n\r\nWally turned to Jill.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” he said. “All this hasn’t happened, and we’re just as\r\ngood pals as before?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But …” He forced a laugh … “mark my words, a time may come, and then …\r\n!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“A time may come,” repeated Wally. “At any rate, let me think so. It\r\nhas nothing to do with me. It’s for you to decide, absolutely. I’m not\r\ngoing to pursue you with my addresses! If ever you get that room of\r\nyours emptied, you won’t have to hang out a ‘To Let’ sign. I shall be\r\nwaiting and you will know where to find me. And, in the meantime, yours\r\nto command, Wallace Mason. Is that clear?”\r\n\r\n“Quite clear.” Jill looked at him affectionately. “There’s nobody I’d\r\nrather open that room to than you, Wally. You know that.”\r\n\r\n“Is that the solemn truth?”\r\n\r\n“The solemn truth!”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Wally, “in two minutes you will see a startled waiter.\r\nThere will be about fourteen dollars change out of that twenty he took\r\naway. I’m going to give it all to him.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t!”\r\n\r\n“Every cent!” said Wally firm. “And the young Greek brigand who stole\r\nmy hat at the door is going to get a dollar! That, as our ascetic and\r\nhonorable friend Goble would say, is the sort of little guy _I_ am!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe red-faced man at the next table eyed them as they went out, leaving\r\nbehind them a waiter who clutched totteringly for support at the back\r\nof a chair.\r\n\r\n“Had a row,” he decided, “but made it up.”\r\n\r\nHe called for a toothpick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nOn the boardwalk at Atlantic City, that much-enduring seashore resort\r\nwhich has been the birthplace of so many musical plays, there stands an\r\nall-day and all-night restaurant, under the same management and\r\noffering the same hospitality as the one in Columbus Circle at which\r\nJill had taken her first meal on arriving in New York. At least, its\r\nhospitality is noisy during the waking and working hours of the day;\r\nbut there are moments when it has an almost cloistral peace, and the\r\ncustomer, abashed by the cold calm of its snowy marble and the silent\r\ngravity of the white-robed attendants, unconsciously lowers his voice\r\nand tries to keep his feet from shuffling, like one in a temple. The\r\nmembers of the chorus of “The Rose of America,” dropping in by ones and\r\ntwos at six o’clock in the morning about two weeks after the events\r\nrecorded in the last chapter, spoke in whispers and gave their orders\r\nfor breakfast in a subdued undertone.\r\n\r\nThe dress-rehearsal had just dragged its weary length to a close. It is\r\nthe custom of the dwellers in Atlantic City, who seem to live entirely\r\nfor pleasure, to attend a species of vaudeville performance—incorrectly\r\ntermed a sacred concert—on Sunday nights: and it had been one o’clock\r\nin the morning before the concert scenery could be moved out of the\r\ntheatre and the first act set of “The Rose of America” moved in. And,\r\nas by some unwritten law of the drama no dress-rehearsal can begin\r\nwithout a delay of at least an hour and a half, the curtain had not\r\ngone up on Mr Miller’s opening chorus till half past two. There had\r\nbeen dress-parades, conferences, interminable arguments between the\r\nstage-director and a mysterious man in shirtsleeves about the lights,\r\nmore dress-parades, further conferences, hitches with regard to the\r\nsets, and another outbreak of debate on the subject of blues, ambers,\r\nand the management of the “spot,” which was worked by a plaintive\r\nvoice, answering to the name of Charlie, at the back of the family\r\ncircle. But by six o’clock a complete, if ragged, performance had been\r\ngiven, and the chorus, who had partaken of no nourishment since dinner\r\non the previous night, had limped off round the corner for a bite of\r\nbreakfast before going to bed.\r\n\r\nThey were a battered and a draggled company, some with dark circles\r\nbeneath their eyes, others blooming with the unnatural scarlet of the\r\nmake-up which they had been too tired to take off. The Duchess, haughty\r\nto the last, had fallen asleep with her head on the table. The\r\nred-headed Babe was lying back in her chair, staring at the ceiling.\r\nThe Southern girl blinked like an owl at the morning sunshine out on\r\nthe boardwalk.\r\n\r\nThe Cherub, whose triumphant youth had brought her almost fresh through\r\na sleepless night, contributed the only remark made during the interval\r\nof waiting for the meal.\r\n\r\n“The fascination of a thtage life! Why girls leave home!” She looked at\r\nher reflection in the little mirror of her vanity-bag. “It _is_ a\r\nface!” she murmured reflectively. “But I should hate to have to go\r\naround with it long!”\r\n\r\nA sallow young man, with the alertness peculiar to those who work on\r\nthe night-shifts of restaurants, dumped a tray down on the table with a\r\nclatter. The Duchess woke up. Babe took her eyes off the ceiling. The\r\nSouthern girl ceased to look at the sunshine. Already, at the mere\r\nsight of food, the extraordinary recuperative powers of the theatrical\r\nworker had begun to assert themselves. In five minutes these girls\r\nwould be feeling completely restored and fit for anything.\r\n\r\nConversation broke out with the first sip of coffee, and the calm of\r\nthe restaurant was shattered. Its day had begun.\r\n\r\n“It’s a great life if you don’t weaken,” said the Cherub, hungrily\r\nattacking her omelette. “And the wortht is yet to come! I thuppose all\r\nyou old dears realithe that this show will have to be rewritten from\r\nend to end, and we’ll be rehearthing day and night all the time we’re\r\non the road.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Lois Denham spoke with her mouth full. “What’s wrong with it?”\r\n\r\nThe Duchess took a sip of coffee.\r\n\r\n“Don’t make me laugh!” she pleaded. “What’s wrong with it? What’s right\r\nwith it, one would feel more inclined to ask!”\r\n\r\n“One would feel thtill more inclined,” said the Cherub, “to athk why\r\none was thuch a chump as to let oneself in for this sort of thing when\r\none hears on all sides that waitresses earn thixty dollars a month.”\r\n\r\n“The numbers are all right,” argued Babe. “I don’t mean the melodies,\r\nbut Johnny has arranged some good business.”\r\n\r\n“He always does,” said the Southern girl. “Some more buckwheat cakes,\r\nplease. But what about the book?”\r\n\r\n“I never listen to the book.”\r\n\r\nThe Cherub laughed.\r\n\r\n“You’re too good to yourself! I listened to it right along and take it\r\nfrom me it’s sad! Of courthe they’ll have it fixed. We can’t open in\r\nNew York like this. My professional reputation wouldn’t thtand it!\r\nDidn’t you thee Wally Mason in front, making notes? They’ve got him\r\ndown to do the rewriting.”\r\n\r\nJill, who had been listening in a dazed way to the conversation,\r\nfighting against the waves of sleep which flooded over her, woke up.\r\n\r\n“Was Wally—was Mr Mason there?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Sitting at the back.”\r\n\r\nJill couldn’t have said whether she was glad or sorry. She had not seen\r\nWally since that afternoon when they lunched together at the\r\nCosmopolis, and the rush of the final weeks of rehearsals had given her\r\nlittle opportunity for thinking of him. At the back of her mind had\r\nbeen the feeling that sooner or later she would have to think of him,\r\nbut for two weeks she had been too tired and too busy to re-examine him\r\nas a factor in her life. There had been times when the thought of him\r\nhad been like the sunshine on a winter day, warming her with almost an\r\nimpersonal glow in moments of depression. And then some sharp, poignant\r\nmemory of Derek would come to blot him out. She remembered the image\r\nshe had used to explain Derek to Wally, and the truth of it came home\r\nto her more strongly than ever. Whatever Derek might have done, he was\r\nin her heart and she could not get him out.\r\n\r\nShe came out of her thoughts to find that the talk had taken another\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n“And the wortht of it is,” the Cherub was saying, “we shall rehearthe\r\nall day and give a show every night and work ourselves to the bone, and\r\nthen, when they’re good and ready, they’ll fire one of us!”\r\n\r\n“That’s right!” agreed the Southern girl.\r\n\r\n“They couldn’t!” Jill cried.\r\n\r\n“You wait!” said the Cherub. “They’ll never open in New York with\r\nthirteen girls. Ike’s much too thuperstitious.”\r\n\r\n“But they wouldn’t do a thing like that after we’ve all worked so\r\nhard!”\r\n\r\nThere was a general burst of sardonic laughter. Jill’s opinion of the\r\nchivalry of theatrical managers seemed to be higher than that of her\r\nmore experienced colleagues. “They’ll do anything,” the Cherub assured\r\nher. “You don’t know the half of it, dearie,” scoffed Lois Denham. “You\r\ndon’t know the half of it!”\r\n\r\n“Wait till you’ve been in as many shows as I have,” said Babe, shaking\r\nher red locks. “The usual thing is to keep a girl slaving her head off\r\nall through the road-tour and then fire her before the New York\r\nopening.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s a shame! It isn’t fair!”\r\n\r\n“If one is expecting to be treated fairly,” said the Duchess with a\r\nprolonged yawn, “one should not go into the show-business.”\r\n\r\nAnd, having uttered this profoundly true maxim, she fell asleep again.\r\n\r\nThe slumber of the Duchess was the signal for a general move. Her\r\nsomnolence was catching. The restorative effects of the meal were\r\nbeginning to wear off. There was a call for a chorus-rehearsal at four\r\no’clock, and it seemed the wise move to go to bed and get some sleep\r\nwhile there was time. The Duchess was roused from her dreams by means\r\nof a piece of ice from one of the tumblers; checks were paid; and the\r\ncompany poured out, yawning and chattering, into the sunlight of the\r\nempty boardwalk.\r\n\r\nJill detached herself from the group, and made her way to a seat facing\r\nthe ocean. Tiredness had fallen upon her like a leaden weight, crushing\r\nall the power out of her limbs, and the thought of walking to the\r\nboarding-house where, from motives of economy, she was sharing a room\r\nwith the Cherub, paralyzed her.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect morning, clear and cloudless, with the warm freshness\r\nof a day that means to be hotter later on. The sea sparkled in the sun.\r\nLittle waves broke lazily on the gray sand. Jill closed her eyes, for\r\nthe brightness of sun and water was trying; and her thoughts went back\r\nto what the Cherub had said.\r\n\r\nIf Wally was really going to rewrite the play, they would be thrown\r\ntogether. She would be obliged to meet him, and she was not sure that\r\nshe was ready to meet him. Still, he would be somebody to talk to on\r\nsubjects other than the one eternal topic of the theatre, somebody who\r\nbelonged to the old life. She had ceased to regard Freddie Rooke in\r\nthis light: for Freddie, solemn with his new responsibilities as a\r\nprincipal, was the most whole-hearted devotee of “shop” in the company.\r\nFreddie nowadays declined to consider any subject for conversation that\r\ndid not have to do with “The Rose of America” in general and his share\r\nin it in particular. Jill had given him up, and he had paired off with\r\nNelly Bryant. The two were inseparable. Jill had taken one or two meals\r\nwith them, but Freddie’s professional monologues, of which Nelly seemed\r\nnever to weary, were too much for her. As a result she was now very\r\nmuch alone. There were girls in the company whom she liked, but most of\r\nthem had their own intimate friends, and she was always conscious of\r\nnot being really wanted. She was lonely, and, after examining the\r\nmatter as clearly as her tired mind would allow, she found herself\r\ncuriously soothed by the thought that Wally would be near to mitigate\r\nher loneliness.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes, blinking. Sleep had crept upon her with an\r\ninsidious suddenness, and she had almost fallen over on the seat. She\r\nwas just bracing herself to get up and begin the long tramp to the\r\nboarding-house, when a voice spoke at her side.\r\n\r\n“Hullo! Good morning!”\r\n\r\nJill looked up.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Wally!”\r\n\r\n“Surprised to see me?”\r\n\r\n“No. Milly Trevor said she had seen you at the rehearsal last night.”\r\n\r\nWally came round the bench and seated himself at her side. His eyes\r\nwere tired, and his chin dark and bristly.\r\n\r\n“Had breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, thanks. Have you?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. How are you feeling?”\r\n\r\n“Rather tired.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder you’re not dead. I’ve been through a good many\r\ndress-rehearsals, but this one was the record. Why they couldn’t have\r\nhad it comfortably in New York and just have run through the piece\r\nwithout scenery last night, I don’t know, except that in musical comedy\r\nit’s etiquette always to do the most inconvenient thing. They know\r\nperfectly well that there was no chance of getting the scenery into the\r\ntheatre till the small hours. You must be worn out. Why aren’t you in\r\nbed?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t face the walk. I suppose I ought to be going, though.”\r\n\r\nShe half rose, then sank back again. The glitter of the water\r\nhypnotized her. She closed her eyes again. She could hear Wally\r\nspeaking, then his voice grew suddenly faint and far off, and she\r\nceased to fight the delicious drowsiness.\r\n\r\nJill awoke with a start. She opened her eyes, and shut them again at\r\nonce. The sun was very strong now. It was one of those prematurely warm\r\ndays of early Spring which have all the languorous heat of late summer.\r\nShe opened her eyes once more, and found that she was feeling greatly\r\nrefreshed. She also discovered that her head was resting on Wally’s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“Have I been asleep?”\r\n\r\nWally laughed.\r\n\r\n“You have been having what you might call a nap.” He massaged his left\r\narm vigorously. “You needed it. Do you feel more rested now?”\r\n\r\n“Good gracious! Have I been squashing your poor arm all the time? Why\r\ndidn’t you move?”\r\n\r\n“I was afraid you would fall over. You just shut your eyes and toppled\r\nsideways.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the time?”\r\n\r\nWally looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n“Just on ten.”\r\n\r\n“Ten!” Jill was horrified. “Why, I have been giving you cramp for about\r\nthree hours! You must have had an awful time!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it was all right. I think I dozed off myself. Except that the\r\nbirds didn’t come and cover us with leaves; it was rather like the\r\n‘Babes in the Wood.’”\r\n\r\n“But you haven’t had any breakfast! Aren’t you starving?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m not saying I wouldn’t spear a fried egg with some vim if it\r\nhappened to float past. But there’s plenty of time for that. Lots of\r\ndoctors say you oughtn’t to eat breakfast, and Indian fakirs go without\r\nfood for days at a time in order to develop their souls. Shall I take\r\nyou back to wherever you’re staying? You ought to get a proper sleep in\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t dream of taking me. Go off and have something to eat.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that can wait. I’d like to see you safely home.”\r\n\r\nJill was conscious of a renewed sense of his comfortingness. There was\r\nno doubt about it, Wally was different from any other man she had\r\nknown. She suddenly felt guilty, as if she were obtaining something\r\nvaluable under false pretences.\r\n\r\n“Wally!”\r\n\r\n“Hullo?”\r\n\r\n“You—you oughtn’t to be so good to me!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Where’s the harm in lending a hand—or, rather, an arm—to a\r\npal in trouble?”\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean. I can’t … that is to say … it isn’t as though …\r\nI mean …”\r\n\r\nWally smiled a tired, friendly smile.\r\n\r\n“If you’re trying to say what I think you’re trying to say, don’t! We\r\nhad all that out two weeks ago. I quite understand the position. You\r\nmustn’t worry yourself about it.” He took her arm, and they crossed the\r\nboardwalk. “Are we going in the right direction? You lead the way. I\r\nknow exactly how you feel. We’re old friends, and nothing more. But, as\r\nan old friend, I claim the right to behave like an old friend. If an\r\nold friend can’t behave like an old friend, how _can_ an old friend\r\nbehave? And now we’ll rule the whole topic out of the conversation. But\r\nperhaps you’re too tired for conversation?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will tell you about the sad death of young Mr Pilkington.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Well, when I say death, I use the word in a loose sense. The human\r\ngiraffe still breathes, and I imagine, from the speed with which he\r\nlegged it back to his hotel when we parted, that he still takes\r\nnourishment. But really he is dead. His heart is broken. We had a\r\nconference after the dress-rehearsal, and our friend Mr Goble told him\r\nin no uncertain words—in the whole course of my experience I have never\r\nheard words less uncertain—that his damned rotten high-brow false-alarm\r\nof a show—I am quoting Mr Goble—would have to be rewritten by alien\r\nhands. And these are them! On the right, alien right hand. On the left,\r\nalien left hand. Yes, I am the instrument selected for the murder of\r\nPilkington’s artistic aspirations. I’m going to rewrite the show. In\r\nfact, I have already rewritten the first act and most of the second.\r\nGoble foresaw this contingency and told me to get busy two weeks ago,\r\nand I’ve been working hard ever since. We shall start rehearsing the\r\nnew version tomorrow and open in Baltimore next Monday with practically\r\na different piece. And it’s going to be a pippin, believe me, said our\r\nhero modestly. A gang of composers has been working in shifts for two\r\nweeks, and, by chucking out nearly all of the original music, we shall\r\nhave a good score. It means a lot of work for you, I’m afraid. All the\r\nbusiness of the numbers will have to be re-arranged.”\r\n\r\n“I like work,” said Jill. “But I’m sorry for Mr Pilkington.”\r\n\r\n“He’s all right. He owns seventy per cent of the show. He may make a\r\nfortune. He’s certain to make a comfortable sum. That is, if he doesn’t\r\nsell out his interest in pique—or dudgeon, if you prefer it. From what\r\nhe said at the close of the proceedings, I fancy he would sell out to\r\nanybody who asked him. At least, he said that he washed his hands of\r\nthe piece. He’s going back to New York this afternoon,—won’t even wait\r\nfor the opening. Of course, _I’m_ sorry for the poor chap in a way, but\r\nhe had no right, with the excellent central idea which he got, to turn\r\nout such a rotten book. Oh, by the way!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Another tragedy! Unavoidable, but pathetic. Poor old Freddie! He’s\r\nout!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!”\r\n\r\n“Out!” repeated Wally firmly.\r\n\r\n“But didn’t you think he was good last night?”\r\n\r\n“He was awful! But that isn’t why. Goble wanted his part rewritten as a\r\nScotchman, so as to get McAndrew, the fellow who made such a hit last\r\nseason in ‘Hoots, Mon!’ That sort of thing is always happening in\r\nmusical comedy. You have to fit parts to suit whatever good people\r\nhappen to be available at the moment. When you’ve had one or two\r\nexperiences of changing your Italian count to a Jewish\r\nmillionaire—invariably against time: they always want the script on\r\nThursday next at noon—and then changing him again to a Russian\r\nBolshevik, you begin to realize what is meant by the words ‘Death,\r\nwhere is thy sting?’ My heart bleeds for Freddie, but what can one do?\r\nAt any rate he isn’t so badly off as a fellow was in one of my shows.\r\nIn the second act he was supposed to have escaped from an asylum, and\r\nthe management, in a passion for realism, insisted that he should shave\r\nhis head. The day after he shaved it, they heard that a superior\r\ncomedian was disengaged and fired him. It’s a ruthless business.”\r\n\r\n“The girls were saying that one of us would be dismissed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I shouldn’t think that’s likely.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not.”\r\n\r\n“So do I. What are we stopping for?” Jill had halted in front of a\r\nshabby-looking house, one of those depressing buildings which spring up\r\novernight at seashore resorts and start to decay the moment the\r\nbuilders have left them.\r\n\r\n“I live here.”\r\n\r\n“Here!” Wally looked at her in consternation. “But …”\r\n\r\nJill smiled.\r\n\r\n“We working-girls have got to economize. Besides, it’s quite\r\ncomfortable—fairly comfortable—inside, and it’s only for a week.” She\r\nyawned. “I believe I’m falling asleep again. I’d better hurry in and go\r\nto bed. Good-bye, Wally dear. You’ve been wonderful. Mind you go and\r\nget a good breakfast.”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nWhen Jill arrived at the theatre at four o’clock for the chorus\r\nrehearsal, the expected blow had not fallen. No steps had apparently\r\nbeen taken to eliminate the thirteenth girl whose presence in the cast\r\npreyed on Mr. Goble’s superstitious mind. But she found her colleagues\r\nstill in a condition of pessimistic foreboding. “Wait!” was the gloomy\r\nwatchword of “The Rose of America” chorus.\r\n\r\nThe rehearsal passed off without event. It lasted until six o’clock,\r\nwhen Jill, the Cherub, and two or three of the other girls went to\r\nsnatch a hasty dinner before returning to the theatre to make up. It\r\nwas not a cheerful meal. Reaction had set in after the overexertion of\r\nthe previous night, and it was too early for first-night excitement to\r\ntake its place. Everybody, even the Cherub, whose spirits seldom failed\r\nher, was depressed, and the idea of an overhanging doom had grown. It\r\nseemed now to be merely a question of speculating on the victim, and\r\nthe conversation gave Jill, as the last addition to the company and so\r\nthe cause of swelling the ranks of the chorus to the unlucky number, a\r\nfeeling of guilt. She was glad when it was time to go back to the\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\nThe moment she and her companions entered the dressing-room, it was\r\nmade clear to them that the doom had fallen. In a chair in the corner,\r\nall her pretence and affectation swept away in a flood of tears, sat\r\nthe unhappy Duchess, the center of a group of girls anxious to console\r\nbut limited in their ideas of consolation to an occasional pat on the\r\nback and an offer of a fresh pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“It’s tough, honey!” somebody was saying as Jill came in.\r\n\r\nSomebody else said it was fierce, and a third girl declared it to be\r\nthe limit. A fourth girl, well-meaning but less helpful than she would\r\nhave liked to be, was advising the victim not to worry.\r\n\r\nThe story of the disaster was brief and easily told. The Duchess,\r\nsailing in at the stage-door, had paused at the letter-box to see if\r\nCuthbert, her faithful auto-salesman, had sent her a good-luck\r\ntelegram. He had, but his good wishes were unfortunately neutralized by\r\nthe fact that the very next letter in the box was one from the\r\nmanagement, crisp and to the point, informing the Duchess that her\r\nservices would not be required that night or thereafter. It was the\r\nsubtle meanness of the blow that roused the indignation of “The Rose of\r\nAmerica” chorus, the cunning villainy with which it had been timed.\r\n\r\n“Poor Mae, if she’d opened tonight, they’d have had to give her two\r\nweeks’ notice or her salary. But they can fire her without a cent just\r\nbecause she’s only been rehearsing and hasn’t given a show!”\r\n\r\nThe Duchess burst into fresh flood of tears.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you worry, honey!” advised the well-meaning girl, who would have\r\nbeen in her element looking in on Job with Bildad the Shuhite and his\r\nfriends. “Don’t you worry!”\r\n\r\n“It’s tough!” said the girl, who had adopted that form of verbal\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\n“It’s fierce!” said the girl who preferred that adjective.\r\n\r\nThe other girl, with an air of saying something new, repeated her\r\nstatement that it was the limit. The Duchess cried forlornly\r\nthroughout. She had needed this engagement badly. Chorus salaries are\r\nnot stupendous, but it is possible to save money by means of them\r\nduring a New York run, especially if you have spent three years in a\r\nmilliner’s shop and can make your own clothes, as the Duchess, in spite\r\nof her air of being turned out by Fifth Avenue modistes, could and did.\r\nShe had been looking forward, now that this absurd piece was to be\r\nrewritten by someone who knew his business and had a good chance of\r\nsuccess, to putting by just those few dollars that make all the\r\ndifference when you are embarking on married life. Cuthbert, for all\r\nhis faithfulness, could not hold up the financial end of the\r\nestablishment unsupported for at least another eighteen months; and\r\nthis disaster meant that the wedding would have to be postponed again.\r\nSo the Duchess, abandoning that aristocratic manner criticized by some\r\nof her colleagues as “up-stage” and by others as “Ritz-y,” sat in her\r\nchair and consumed pocket-handkerchiefs as fast as they were offered to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nJill had been the only girl in the room who had spoken no word of\r\nconsolation. This was not because she was not sorry for the Duchess.\r\nShe had never been sorrier for any one in her life. The pathos of that\r\nswift descent from haughtiness to misery had bitten deep into her\r\nsensitive heart. But she revolted at the idea of echoing the banal\r\nwords of the others. Words were no good, she thought, as she set her\r\nlittle teeth and glared at an absent management,—a management just\r\nabout now presumably distending itself with a luxurious dinner at one\r\nof the big hotels. Deeds were what she demanded. All her life she had\r\nbeen a girl of impulsive action, and she wanted to act impulsively now.\r\nShe was in much the same Berserk mood as had swept her, raging, to the\r\ndefence of Bill the parrot on the occasion of his dispute with Henry of\r\nLondon. The fighting spirit which had been drained from her by the\r\nall-night rehearsal had come back in full measure.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to _do?_” she cried. “Aren’t you going to _do_\r\nsomething?”\r\n\r\nDo? The members of “The Rose of America” ensemble looked doubtfully at\r\none another. Do? It had not occurred to them that there was anything to\r\nbe done. These things happened, and you regretted them, but as for\r\ndoing anything, well, what _could_ you do?\r\n\r\nJill’s face was white and her eyes were flaming. She dominated the\r\nroomful of girls like a little Napoleon. The change in her startled\r\nthem. Hitherto they had always looked on her as rather an unusually\r\nquiet girl. She had always made herself unobtrusively pleasant to them\r\nall. They all liked her. But they had never suspected her of possessing\r\nthis militant quality. Nobody spoke, but there was a general stir. She\r\nhad flung a new idea broadcast, and it was beginning to take root. Do\r\nsomething? Well, if it came to that, why not?\r\n\r\n“We ought all to refuse to go on tonight unless they let her go on!”\r\nJill declared.\r\n\r\nThe stir became a movement. Enthusiasm is catching, and every girl is\r\nat heart a rebel. And the idea was appealing to the imagination. Refuse\r\nto give a show on the opening night! Had a chorus ever done such a\r\nthing? They trembled on the verge of making history.\r\n\r\n“Strike?” quavered somebody at the back.\r\n\r\n“Yes, strike!” cried Jill.\r\n\r\n“Hooray! That’s the thtuff!” shouted the Cherub, and turned the scale.\r\nShe was a popular girl, and her adherence to the Cause confirmed the\r\ndoubters. “Thtrike!”\r\n\r\n“Strike! Strike!”\r\n\r\nJill turned to the Duchess, who had been gaping amazedly at the\r\ndemonstration. She no longer wept, but she seemed in a dream.\r\n\r\n“Dress and get ready to go on,” Jill commanded. “We’ll all dress and\r\nget ready to go on. Then I’ll go and find Mr Goble and tell him what we\r\nmean to do. And, if he doesn’t give in, we’ll stay here in this room,\r\nand there won’t be a performance!”\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nMr Goble, with a Derby hat on the back of his head and an unlighted\r\ncigar in the corner of his mouth, was superintending the erection of\r\nthe first act set when Jill found him. He was standing with his back to\r\nthe safety-curtain glowering at a blue canvas, supposed to represent\r\none of those picturesque summer skies which you get at the best places\r\non Long Island. Jill, coming down stage from the staircase that led to\r\nthe dressing-room, interrupted his line of vision.\r\n\r\n“Get out of the light!” bellowed Mr Goble, always a man of direct\r\nspeech, adding “Damn you!” for good measure.\r\n\r\n“Please move to one side,” interpreted the stage-director. “Mr Goble is\r\nlooking at the set.”\r\n\r\nThe head carpenter, who completed the little group, said nothing. Stage\r\ncarpenters always say nothing. Long association with fussy directors\r\nhas taught them that the only policy to pursue on opening nights is to\r\nwithdraw into the silence, wrap themselves up in it, and not emerge\r\nuntil the enemy has grown tired and gone off to worry somebody else.\r\n\r\n“It don’t look right!” said Mr Goble, cocking his head on one side.\r\n\r\n“I see what you mean, Mr Goble,” assented the stage-director\r\nobsequiously. “It has perhaps a little too much—er—not quite\r\nenough—yes, I see what you mean!”\r\n\r\n“It’s too—damn—BLUE!” rasped Mr Goble, impatient of this vacillating\r\ncriticism. “That’s what’s the matter with it.”\r\n\r\nThe head carpenter abandoned the silent policy of a lifetime. He felt\r\nimpelled to utter. He was a man who, when not at the theatre, spent\r\nmost of his time in bed, reading all-fiction magazines: but it so\r\nhappened that once, last summer, he had actually seen the sky; and he\r\nconsidered that this entitled him to speak almost as a specialist on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n“Ther sky _is_ blue!” he observed huskily. “Yessir! I seen it!”\r\n\r\nHe passed into the silence again, and, to prevent a further lapse,\r\nstopped up his mouth with a piece of chewing-gum.\r\n\r\nMr Goble regarded the silver-tongued orator wrathfully. He was not\r\naccustomed to chatter-boxes arguing with him like this. He would\r\nprobably have said something momentous and crushing, but at this point\r\nJill intervened.\r\n\r\n“Mr Goble.”\r\n\r\nThe manager swung round on her.\r\n\r\n“What _is_ it?”\r\n\r\nIt is sad to think how swiftly affection can change to dislike in this\r\nworld. Two weeks before, Mr Goble had looked on Jill with favor. She\r\nhad seemed good in his eyes. But that refusal of hers to lunch with\r\nhim, followed by a refusal some days later to take a bit of supper\r\nsomewhere, had altered his views on feminine charm. If it had been left\r\nto him, as most things were about his theatre, to decide which of the\r\nthirteen girls should be dismissed, he would undoubtedly have selected\r\nJill. But at this stage in the proceedings there was the unfortunate\r\nnecessity of making concessions to the temperamental Johnson Miller. Mr\r\nGoble was aware that the dance-director’s services would be badly\r\nneeded in the re-arrangement of the numbers during the coming week or\r\nso, and he knew that there were a dozen managers waiting eagerly to\r\nwelcome him if he threw up his present job, so he had been obliged to\r\napproach him in quite a humble spirit and enquire which of his female\r\nchorus could be most easily spared. And, as the Duchess had a habit of\r\ncarrying her haughty languor onto the stage and employing it as a\r\nsubstitute for the chorea which was Mr. Miller’s ideal, the\r\ndancer-director had chosen her. To Mr Goble’s dislike of Jill,\r\ntherefore, was added now something of the fury of the baffled\r\npotentate.\r\n\r\n“’Jer want?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Mr Goble is extremely busy,” said the stage-director. “Ex-tremely.”\r\n\r\nA momentary doubt as to the best way of approaching her subject had\r\ntroubled Jill on her way downstairs, but, now that she was on the\r\nbattle-field confronting the enemy, she found herself cool, collected,\r\nand full of a cold rage which steeled her nerves without confusing her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“I came to ask you to let Mae D’Arcy go on tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Who the hell’s Mae D’Arcy?” Mr Goble broke off to bellow at a\r\nscene-shifter who was depositing the wall of Mrs Stuyvesant van Dyke’s\r\nLong Island residence too far down stage. “Not there, you fool! Higher\r\nup!”\r\n\r\n“You gave her her notice this evening,” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“Well, what about it?”\r\n\r\n“We want you to withdraw it.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s ‘we’?”\r\n\r\n“The other girls and myself.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble jerked his head so violently that the Derby hat flew off, to\r\nbe picked up, dusted, and restored by the stage-director.\r\n\r\n“Oh, so you don’t like it? Well, you know what you can do …”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jill, “we do. We are going to strike.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t let Mae go on, we shan’t go on. There won’t be a\r\nperformance tonight, unless you like to give one without a chorus.”\r\n\r\n“Are you crazy!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. But we’re quite unanimous.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble, like most theatrical managers, was not good at words of over\r\ntwo syllables.\r\n\r\n“You’re what?”\r\n\r\n“We’ve talked it over, and we’ve all decided to do what I said.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble’s hat shot off again, and gambolled away into the wings, with\r\nthe stage-director bounding after it like a retriever.\r\n\r\n“Whose idea’s this?” demanded Mr Goble. His eyes were a little foggy,\r\nfor his brain was adjusting itself but slowly to the novel situation.\r\n\r\n“Mine.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yours! I thought as much!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jill, “I’ll go back and tell them that you will not do\r\nwhat we ask. We will keep our make-up on in case you change your mind.”\r\n\r\nShe turned away.\r\n\r\n“Come back!”\r\n\r\nJill proceeded toward the staircase. As she went, a husky voice spoke\r\nin her ear.\r\n\r\n“Go to it, kid! You’re all right!”\r\n\r\nThe head-carpenter had broken his Trappist vows twice in a single\r\nevening, a thing which had not happened to him since the night three\r\nyears ago, when, sinking wearily onto a seat in a dark corner for a bit\r\nof a rest, he found that one of his assistants had placed a pot of red\r\npaint there.\r\n\r\n§ 4.\r\n\r\nTo Mr Goble, fermenting and full of strange oaths, entered Johnson\r\nMiller. The dance-director was always edgey on first nights, and during\r\nthe foregoing conversation had been flitting about the stage like a\r\nwhite-haired moth. His deafness had kept him in complete ignorance that\r\nthere was anything untoward afoot, and he now approached Mr Goble with\r\nhis watch in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Eight twenty-five,” he observed. “Time those girls were on stage.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble, glad of a concrete target for his wrath, cursed him in about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty rich and well-selected words.\r\n\r\n“Huh?” said Mr Miller, hand to ear.\r\n\r\nMr Goble repeated the last hundred and eleven words, the pick of the\r\nbunch.\r\n\r\n“Can’t hear!” said Mr Miller, regretfully. “Got a cold.”\r\n\r\nThe grave danger that Mr Goble, a thick-necked man, would undergo some\r\nsort of a stroke was averted by the presence-of-mind of the\r\nstage-director, who, returning with the hat, presented it like a\r\nbouquet to his employer, and then his hands being now unoccupied,\r\nformed them into a funnel and through this flesh-and-blood megaphone\r\nendeavored to impart the bad news.\r\n\r\n“The girls say they won’t go on!”\r\n\r\nMr Miller nodded.\r\n\r\n“I _said_ it was time they were on.”\r\n\r\n“They’re on strike!”\r\n\r\n“It’s not,” said Mr Miller austerely, “what they _like_, it’s what\r\nthey’re paid for. They ought to be on stage. We should be ringing up in\r\ntwo minutes.”\r\n\r\nThe stage director drew another breath, then thought better of it. He\r\nhad a wife and children, and, if dadda went under with apoplexy, what\r\nbecame of the home, civilization’s most sacred product? He relaxed the\r\nmuscles of his diaphragm, and reached for pencil and paper.\r\n\r\nMr Miller inspected the message, felt for his spectacle-case, found it,\r\nopened it, took out his glasses, replaced the spectacle-case, felt for\r\nhis handkerchief, polished the glasses, replaced the handkerchief, put\r\nthe glasses on, and read. A blank look came into his face.\r\n\r\n“Why?” he enquired.\r\n\r\nThe stage director, with a nod of the head intended to imply that he\r\nmust be patient and all would come right in the future, recovered the\r\npaper, and scribbled another sentence. Mr Miller perused it.\r\n\r\n“Because Mae D’Arcy has got her notice?” he queried, amazed. “But the\r\ngirl can’t dance a step.”\r\n\r\nThe stage director, by means of a wave of the hand, a lifting of both\r\neyebrows, and a wrinkling of the nose, replied that the situation,\r\nunreasonable as it might appear to the thinking man, was as he had\r\nstated and must be faced. What, he enquired—through the medium of a\r\nclever drooping of the mouth and a shrug of the shoulders—was to be\r\ndone about it?\r\n\r\nMr Miller remained for a moment in meditation.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go and talk to them,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe flitted off, and the stage director leaned back against the asbestos\r\ncurtain. He was exhausted, and his throat was in agony, but\r\nnevertheless he was conscious of a feeling of quiet happiness. His life\r\nhad been lived in the shadow of the constant fear that some day Mr\r\nGoble might dismiss him. Should that disaster occur, he felt, there was\r\nalways a future for him in the movies.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Mr Miller disappeared on his peace-making errand, when\r\nthere was a noise like a fowl going through a quickset hedge, and Mr\r\nSaltzburg, brandishing his baton as if he were conducting an unseen\r\norchestra, plunged through the scenery at the left upper entrance and\r\ncharged excitedly down the stage. Having taken his musicians twice\r\nthrough the overture, he had for ten minutes been sitting in silence,\r\nwaiting for the curtain to go up. At last, his emotional nature\r\ncracking under the strain of this suspense, he had left his conductor’s\r\nchair and plunged down under the stage by way of the musician’s\r\nbolthole to ascertain what was causing the delay.\r\n\r\n“What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it?” enquired Mr\r\nSaltzburg. “I wait and wait and wait and wait and wait. … We cannot\r\nplay the overture again. What is it? What has happened?”\r\n\r\nMr Goble, that overwrought soul, had betaken himself to the wings,\r\nwhere he was striding up and down with his hands behind his back,\r\nchewing his cigar. The stage director braced himself once more to the\r\ntask of explanation.\r\n\r\n“The girls have struck!”\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg blinked through his glasses.\r\n\r\n“The girls?” he repeated blankly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn it!” cried the stage director, his patience at last giving\r\nway. “You know what a girl is, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“They have what?”\r\n\r\n“Struck! Walked out on us! Refused to go on!”\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg reeled under the blow.\r\n\r\n“But it is impossible! Who is to sing the opening chorus?”\r\n\r\nIn the presence of one to whom he could relieve his mind without fear\r\nof consequences, the stage director became savagely jocular.\r\n\r\n“That’s all arranged,” he said. “We’re going to dress the carpenters in\r\nskirts. The audience won’t notice anything wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Should I speak to Mr Goble?” queried Mr Saltzburg doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you don’t value your life,” returned the stage director.\r\n\r\nMr Saltzburg pondered.\r\n\r\n“I will go and speak to the children,” he said. “I will talk to them.\r\nThey know _me!_ I will make them be reasonable.”\r\n\r\nHe bustled off in the direction taken by Mr Miller, his coattails\r\nflying behind him. The stage director, with a tired sigh, turned to\r\nface Wally, who had come in through the iron pass-door from the\r\nauditorium.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said Wally cheerfully. “Going strong? How’s everybody at home?\r\nFine! So am I! By the way, am I wrong or did I hear something about a\r\ntheatrical entertainment of some sort here tonight?” He looked about\r\nhim at the empty stage. In the wings, on the prompt side, could be\r\ndiscerned the flannel-clad forms of the gentlemanly members of the male\r\nensemble, all dressed up for Mrs Stuyvesant van Dyke’s tennis party.\r\nOne or two of the principals were standing perplexedly in the lower\r\nentrance. The O. P. side had been given over by general consent to Mr\r\nGoble for his perambulations. Every now and then he would flash into\r\nview through an opening in the scenery. “I understood that tonight was\r\nthe night for the great revival of comic opera. Where are the comics,\r\nand why aren’t they opping?”\r\n\r\nThe stage director repeated his formula once more.\r\n\r\n“The girls have struck!”\r\n\r\n“So have the clocks,” said Wally. “It’s past nine.”\r\n\r\n“The chorus refuse to go on.”\r\n\r\n“No, really! Just artistic loathing of the rotten piece, or is there\r\nsome other reason?”\r\n\r\n“They’re sore because one of them has been given her notice, and they\r\nsay they won’t give a show unless she’s taken back. They’ve struck.\r\nThat Mariner girl started it.”\r\n\r\n“She did!” Wally’s interest became keener. “She would!” he said\r\napprovingly. “She’s a heroine!”\r\n\r\n“Little devil! I never liked that girl!”\r\n\r\n“Now there,” said Wally, “is just the point on which we differ. I have\r\nalways liked her, and I’ve known her all my life. So, shipmate, if you\r\nhave any derogatory remarks to make about Miss Mariner, keep them where\r\nthey belong—_there!_” He prodded the other sharply in the stomach. He\r\nwas smiling pleasantly, but the stage director, catching his eye,\r\ndecided that his advice was good and should be followed. It is just as\r\nbad for the home if the head of the family gets his neck broken as if\r\nhe succumbs to apoplexy.\r\n\r\n“You surely aren’t on their side?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Me!” said Wally. “Of course I am. I’m always on the side of the\r\ndown-trodden and oppressed. If you know of a dirtier trick than firing\r\na girl just before the opening, so that they won’t have to pay her two\r\nweeks’ salary, mention it. Till you do, I’ll go on believing that it is\r\nthe limit. Of course I’m on the girls’ side. I’ll make them a speech if\r\nthey want me to, or head the procession with a banner if they are going\r\nto parade down the boardwalk. I’m for ’em, Father Abraham, a hundred\r\nthousand strong. And then a few! If you want my considered opinion, our\r\nold friend Goble has asked for it and got it. And I’m glad—glad—glad,\r\nif you don’t mind my quoting Pollyanna for a moment. I hope it chokes\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\n“You’d better not let him hear you talking like that!”\r\n\r\n“An contraire, as we say in the Gay City, I’m going to make a point of\r\nletting him hear me talk like that! Adjust the impression that I fear\r\nany Goble in shining armor, because I don’t. I propose to speak my mind\r\nto him. I would beard him in his lair, if he had a beard. Well, I’ll\r\nclean-shave him in his lair. That will be just as good. But hist! whom\r\nhave we here? Tell me, do you see the same thing I see?”\r\n\r\nLike the vanguard of a defeated army, Mr Saltzburg was coming\r\ndejectedly across the stage.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said the stage-director.\r\n\r\n“They would not listen to me,” said Mr Saltzburg brokenly. “The more I\r\ntalked, the more they did not listen!” He winced at a painful memory.\r\n“Miss Trevor stole my baton, and then they all lined up and sang the\r\n‘Star-Spangled Banner’!”\r\n\r\n“Not the words?” cried Wally incredulously. “Don’t tell me they knew\r\nthe words!”\r\n\r\n“Mr Miller is still up there, arguing with them. But it will be of no\r\nuse. What shall we do?” asked Mr Saltzburg helplessly. “We ought to\r\nhave rung up half an hour ago. What shall we do-oo-oo?”\r\n\r\n“We must go and talk to Goble,” said Wally. “Something has got to be\r\nsettled quick. When I left, the audience was getting so impatient that\r\nI thought he was going to walk out on us. He’s one of those nasty,\r\ndetermined-looking men. So come along!”\r\n\r\nMr Goble, intercepted as he was about to turn for another walk\r\nup-stage, eyed the deputation sourly and put the same question that the\r\nstage director had put to Mr Saltzburg.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\nWally came briskly to the point.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to give in,” he said, “or else go and make a speech to the\r\naudience, the burden of which will be that they can have their money\r\nback by applying at the box-office. These Joans of Arc have got you by\r\nthe short hairs!”\r\n\r\n“I won’t give in!”\r\n\r\n“Then give out!” said Wally. “Or pay out, if you prefer it. Trot along\r\nand tell the audience that the four dollars fifty in the house will be\r\nrefunded.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble gnawed his cigar.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the show business fifteen years …”\r\n\r\n“I know. And this sort of thing has never happened to you before. One\r\ngets new experiences.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble cocked his cigar at a fierce angle, and glared at Wally.\r\nSomething told him that Wally’s sympathies were not wholly with him.\r\n\r\n“They can’t do this sort of thing to _me!_” he growled.\r\n\r\n“Well, they are doing it to someone, aren’t they,” said Wally, “and, if\r\nit’s not you, who is it?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve a damned good mind to fire them all!”\r\n\r\n“A corking idea! I can’t see a single thing wrong with it except that\r\nit would hang up the production for another five weeks and lose you\r\nyour bookings and cost you a week’s rent of this theatre for nothing\r\nand mean having all the dresses made over and lead to all your\r\nprincipals going off and getting other jobs. These trifling things\r\napart, we may call the suggestion a bright one.”\r\n\r\n“You talk too damn much!” said Mr Goble, eyeing him with distaste.\r\n\r\n“Well, go on, _you_ say something. Something sensible.”\r\n\r\n“It is a very serious situation …” began the stage director.\r\n\r\n“Oh, shut up!” said Mr Goble.\r\n\r\nThe stage director subsided into his collar.\r\n\r\n“I cannot play the overture again,” protested Mr Saltzburg. “I cannot!”\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr Miller appeared. He was glad to see Mr Goble. He had\r\nbeen looking for him, for he had news to impart.\r\n\r\n“The girls,” said Mr Miller, “have struck! They won’t go on!”\r\n\r\nMr Goble, with the despairing gesture of one who realizes the impotence\r\nof words, dashed off for his favorite walk up stage. Wally took out his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n“Six seconds and a bit,” he said approvingly, as the manager returned.\r\n“A very good performance. I should like to time you over the course in\r\nrunning-kit.”\r\n\r\nThe interval for reflection, brief as it had been, had apparently\r\nenabled Mr Goble to come to a decision.\r\n\r\n“Go,” he said to the stage director, “and tell ’em that fool of a\r\nD’Arcy girl can play. We’ve got to get that curtain up.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr Goble.”\r\n\r\nThe stage director galloped off.\r\n\r\n“Get back to your place,” said the manager to Mr Saltzburg, “and play\r\nthe overture again.”\r\n\r\n“Again!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they didn’t hear it the first two times,” said Wally.\r\n\r\nMr Goble watched Mr Saltzburg out of sight. Then he turned to Wally.\r\n\r\n“That damned Mariner girl was at the bottom of this! She started the\r\nwhole thing! She told me so. Well, I’ll settle _her!_ She goes\r\ntomorrow!”\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute,” said Wally. “Wait one minute! Bright as it is, that\r\nidea is _out!_”\r\n\r\n“What the devil has it got to do with you?”\r\n\r\n“Only this, that, if you fire Miss Mariner, I take that neat script\r\nwhich I’ve prepared and I tear it into a thousand fragments. Or nine\r\nhundred. Anyway, I tear it. Miss Mariner opens in New York, or I pack\r\nup my work and leave.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble’s green eyes glowed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’re stuck on her, are you?” he sneered. “I see!”\r\n\r\n“Listen, dear heart,” said Wally, gripping the manager’s arm, “I can\r\nsee that you are on the verge of introducing personalities into this\r\nvery pleasant little chat. Resist the impulse! Why not let your spine\r\nstay where it is instead of having it kicked up through your hat? Keep\r\nto the main issue. Does Miss Mariner open in New York or does she not?”\r\n\r\nThere was a tense silence. Mr Goble permitted himself a swift review of\r\nhis position. He would have liked to do many things to Wally, beginning\r\nwith ordering him out of the theatre, but prudence restrained him. He\r\nwanted Wally’s work. He needed Wally in his business: and, in the\r\ntheatre, business takes precedence of personal feelings.\r\n\r\n“All right!” he growled reluctantly.\r\n\r\n“That’s a promise,” said Wally. “I’ll see that you keep it.” He looked\r\nover his shoulder. The stage was filled with gayly-colored dresses. The\r\nmutineers had returned to duty. “Well, I’ll be getting along. I’m\r\nrather sorry we agreed to keep clear of personalities, because I should\r\nhave liked to say that, if ever they have a skunk-show at Madison\r\nSquare Garden, you ought to enter—and win the blue ribbon. Still, of\r\ncourse, under our agreement my lips are sealed, and I can’t even hint\r\nat it. Good-bye. See you later, I suppose?”\r\n\r\nMr Goble, giving a creditable imitation of a living statue, was plucked\r\nfrom his thoughts by a hand upon his arm. It was Mr Miller, whose\r\nunfortunate ailment had prevented him from keeping abreast of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“What did he say?” enquired Mr Miller, interested. “I didn’t hear what\r\nhe said!”\r\n\r\nMr Goble made no effort to inform him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington had left Atlantic City two hours after the conference\r\nwhich had followed the dress rehearsal, firmly resolved never to go\r\nnear “The Rose of America” again. He had been wounded in his finest\r\nfeelings. There had been a moment, when Mr Goble had given him the\r\nchoice between having the piece rewritten and cancelling the production\r\naltogether, when he had inclined to the heroic course. But for one\r\nthing, Mr Pilkington would have defied the manager, refused to allow\r\nhis script to be touched, and removed the play from his hands. That one\r\nthing was the fact that, up to the day of the dress rehearsal, the\r\nexpenses of the production had amounted to the appalling sum of\r\nthirty-two thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine dollars, sixty-eight\r\ncents, all of which had to come out of Mr Pilkington’s pocket. The\r\nfigures, presented to him in a neatly typewritten column stretching\r\nover two long sheets of paper, had stunned him. He had had no notion\r\nthat musical plays cost so much. The costumes alone had come to ten\r\nthousand six hundred and sixty-three dollars and fifty cents, and\r\nsomehow that odd fifty cents annoyed Otis Pilkington as much as\r\nanything on the list. A dark suspicion that Mr Goble, who had seen to\r\nall the executive end of the business, had a secret arrangement with\r\nthe costumer whereby he received a private rebate, deepened his gloom.\r\nWhy, for ten thousand six hundred and sixty-three dollars and fifty\r\ncents you could dress the whole female population of New York State and\r\nhave a bit left over for Connecticut. So thought Mr Pilkington, as he\r\nread the bad news in the train. He only ceased to brood upon the high\r\ncost of costuming when in the next line but one there smote his eye an\r\nitem of four hundred and ninety-eight dollars for “Clothing.” Clothing!\r\nWeren’t costumes clothing? Why should he have to pay twice over for the\r\nsame thing? Mr Pilkington was just raging over this, when something\r\nlower down in the column caught his eye. It was the words:—\r\n\r\nClothing … 187.45\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this Otis Pilkington uttered a stifled cry, so sharp and so\r\nanguished that an old lady in the next seat, who was drinking a glass\r\nof milk, dropped it and had to refund the railway company thirty-five\r\ncents for breakages. For the remainder of the journey she sat with one\r\neye warily on Mr Pilkington, waiting for his next move.\r\n\r\nThis misadventure quieted Otis Pilkington down, if it did not soothe\r\nhim. He returned blushingly to a perusal of his bill of costs, nearly\r\nevery line of which contained some item that infuriated and dismayed\r\nhim. “Shoes” ($213.50) he could understand, but what on earth was\r\n“Academy. Rehl. $105.50”? What was “Cuts … $15”? And what in the name\r\nof everything infernal was this item for “Frames,” in which mysterious\r\nluxury he had apparently indulged to the extent of ninety-four dollars\r\nand fifty cents? “Props” occurred on the list no fewer than seventeen\r\ntimes. Whatever his future, at whatever poor-house he might spend his\r\ndeclining years, he was supplied with enough props to last his\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington stared blankly at the scenery that fitted past the\r\ntrain winds. (Scenery! There had been two charges for scenery!\r\n“Friedmann, Samuel … Scenery … $3711” and “Unitt and Wickes … Scenery …\r\n$2120”). He was suffering the torments of the ruined gamester at the\r\nroulette-table. Thirty-two thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine\r\ndollars, sixty-eight cents! And he was out of pocket ten thousand in\r\naddition from the check he had handed over two days ago to Uncle Chris\r\nas his share of the investment of starting Jill in the motion-pictures.\r\nIt was terrible! It deprived one of the power of thought.\r\n\r\nThe power of thought, however, returned to Mr Pilkington almost\r\nimmediately: for, remembering suddenly that Roland Trevis had assured\r\nhim that no musical production, except one of those elaborate\r\ngirl-shows with a chorus of ninety, could possibly cost more than\r\nfifteen thousand dollars at an outside figure, he began to think about\r\nRoland Trevis, and continued to think about him until the train pulled\r\ninto the Pennsylvania Station.\r\n\r\nFor a week or more the stricken financier confined himself mostly to\r\nhis rooms, where he sat smoking cigarettes, gazing at Japanese prints,\r\nand trying not to think about “props” and “rehl.” Then, gradually, the\r\nalmost maternal yearning to see his brain-child once more, which can\r\nnever be wholly crushed out of a young dramatist, returned to\r\nhim—faintly at first, then getting stronger by degrees till it could no\r\nlonger be resisted. True, he knew that when he beheld it, the offspring\r\nof his brain would have been mangled almost out of recognition, but\r\nthat did not deter him. The mother loves her crippled child, and the\r\nauthor of a musical fantasy loves his musical fantasy, even if rough\r\nhands have changed it into a musical comedy and all that remains of his\r\nwork is the opening chorus and a scene which the assassins have\r\noverlooked at the beginning of act two. Otis Pilkington, having\r\ninstructed his Japanese valet to pack a few simple necessaries in a\r\nsuitcase, took a cab to the Grand Central Station and caught an\r\nafternoon train for Rochester, where his recollection of the route\r\nplanned for the tour told him “The Rose of America” would now be\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\nLooking into his club on the way, to cash a check, the first person he\r\nencountered was Freddie Rooke.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!” said Otis Pilkington. “What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nFreddie looked up dully from his reading. The abrupt stoppage of his\r\nprofessional career—his life-work, one might almost say—had left\r\nFreddie at a very loose end: and so hollow did the world seem to him at\r\nthe moment, so uniformly futile all its so-called allurements, that, to\r\npass the time, he had just been trying to read the _National Geographic\r\nMagazine_.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” he said. “Well, might as well be here as anywhere, what?” he\r\nreplied to the other’s question.\r\n\r\n“But why aren’t you playing?”\r\n\r\n“They sacked me!” Freddie lit a cigarette in the sort of way in which\r\nthe strong, silent, middle-aged man on the stage lights his at the end\r\nof act two when he has relinquished the heroine to his youthful rival.\r\n“They’ve changed my part to a bally Scotchman! Well, I mean to say, I\r\ncouldn’t play a bally Scotchman!”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington groaned in spirit. Of all the characters in his musical\r\nfantasy on which he prided himself, that of Lord Finchley was his pet.\r\nAnd he had been burked, murdered, blotted out, in order to make room\r\nfor a bally Scotchman!\r\n\r\n“The character’s called ‘The McWhustle of McWhustle’ now!” said Freddie\r\nsombrely.\r\n\r\nThe McWhustle of McWhustle! Mr Pilkington almost abandoned his trip to\r\nRochester on receiving this devastating piece of information.\r\n\r\n“He comes on in act one in kilts!”\r\n\r\n“In kilts! At Mrs Stuyvesant van Dyke’s lawn-party! On Long Island!”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t Mrs Stuyvesant van Dyke any longer, either,” said Freddie.\r\n“She’s been changed to the wife of a pickle manufacturer.”\r\n\r\n“A pickle manufacturer!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. They said it ought to be a comedy part.”\r\n\r\nIf agony had not caused Mr Pilkington to clutch for support at the back\r\nof a chair, he would undoubtedly have wrung his hands.\r\n\r\n“But it _was_ a comedy part!” he wailed. “It was full of the subtlest,\r\nmost delicate satire on Society. They were delighted with it at\r\nNewport! Oh, this is too much! I shall make a strong protest! I shall\r\ninsist on these parts being kept as I wrote them! I shall … I must be\r\ngoing at once, or I shall miss my train.” He paused at the door. “How\r\nwas business in Baltimore?”\r\n\r\n“Rotten!” said Freddie, and returned to his _National Geographic\r\nMagazine_.\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington tottered into his cab. He was shattered by what he had\r\nheard. They had massacred his beautiful play, and, doing so, had not\r\neven made a success of it by their own sordid commercial lights.\r\nBusiness at Baltimore had been rotten! That meant more expense, further\r\ncolumns of figures with “frames” and “rehl” in front of them! He\r\nstaggered into the station.\r\n\r\n“Hey!” cried the taxi-driver.\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington turned.\r\n\r\n“Sixty-five cents, mister, if _you_ please! Forgetting I’m not your\r\nprivate shovoor, wasn’t you?”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington gave him a dollar. Money—money! Life was just one long\r\nround of paying out and paying out.\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nThe day which Mr Pilkington had selected for his visit to the provinces\r\nwas a Tuesday. “The Rose of America” had opened at Rochester on the\r\nprevious night, after a week at Atlantic City in its original form and\r\na week at Baltimore in what might be called its second incarnation.\r\nBusiness had been bad in Atlantic City and no better in Baltimore, and\r\na meager first-night house at Rochester had given the piece a cold\r\nreception, which had put the finishing touches to the depression of the\r\ncompany in spite of the fact that the Rochester critics, like those of\r\nBaltimore, had written kindly of the play. One of the maxims of the\r\ntheatre is that “out-of-town notices don’t count,” and the company had\r\nrefused to be cheered by them.\r\n\r\nIt is to be doubted, however, if even crowded houses would have aroused\r\nmuch response from the principals and chorus of “The Rose of America.”\r\nFor two weeks without a break they had been working under forced\r\ndraught, and they were weary in body and spirit. The new principals had\r\nhad to learn parts in exactly half the time usually given for that\r\npurpose, and the chorus, after spending five weeks assimilating one set\r\nof steps and groupings, had been compelled to forget them and rehearse\r\nan entirely new set. From the morning after the first performance at\r\nAtlantic City, they had not left the theatre except for sketchy\r\nhalf-hour meals.\r\n\r\nJill, standing listlessly in the wings while the scene-shifters\r\narranged the second act set, was aware of Wally approaching from the\r\ndirection of the pass-door.\r\n\r\n“Miss Mariner, I believe?” said Wally. “I suppose you know you look\r\nperfectly wonderful in that dress? All Rochester’s talking about it,\r\nand there is some idea of running excursion trains from Troy and Utica.\r\nA great stir it has made!”\r\n\r\nJill smiled. Wally was like a tonic to her during these days of\r\noverwork. He seemed to be entirely unaffected by the general\r\ndepression, a fact which he attributed himself to the happy accident of\r\nbeing in a position to sit back and watch the others toil. But in\r\nreality Jill knew that he was working as hard as any one. He was\r\nworking all the time, changing scenes, adding lines, tinkering with\r\nlyrics, smoothing over principals whose nerves had become strained by\r\nthe incessant rehearsing, keeping within bounds Mr Goble’s passion for\r\nbeing the big noise about the theatre. His cheerfulness was due to the\r\nspirit that was in him, and Jill appreciated it. She had come to feel\r\nvery close to Wally since the driving rush of making over “The Rose of\r\nAmerica” had begun.\r\n\r\n“They seemed quite calm tonight,” she said. “I believe half of them\r\nwere asleep.”\r\n\r\n“They’re always like that in Rochester. They cloak their deeper\r\nfeelings. They wear the mask. But you can tell from the glassy look in\r\ntheir eyes that they are really seething inwardly. But what I came\r\nround about was—(a)—to give you this letter …”\r\n\r\nJill took the letter, and glanced at the writing. It was from Uncle\r\nChris. She placed it on the axe over the fire-buckets for perusal\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n“The man at the box-office gave it to me,” said Wally, “when I looked\r\nin there to find out how much money there was in the house tonight. The\r\nsum was so small that he had to whisper it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid the piece isn’t a success.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Of course it is! We’re doing fine. That brings me to section\r\n(b) of my discourse. I met poor old Pilkington in the lobby, and he\r\nsaid exactly what you have just said, only at greater length.”\r\n\r\n“Is Mr Pilkington here?”\r\n\r\n“He appears to have run down on the afternoon train to have a look at\r\nthe show. He is catching the next train back to New York! Whenever I\r\nmeet him, he always seems to be dashing off to catch the next train\r\nback to New York! Poor chap! Have you ever done a murder? If you\r\nhaven’t, don’t! I know exactly what it feels like, and it feels rotten!\r\nAfter two minutes conversation with Pilkington, I could sympathize with\r\nMacbeth when he chatted with Banquo. He said I had killed his play. He\r\nnearly wept, and he drew such a moving picture of a poor helpless\r\nmusical fantasy being lured into a dark alley by thugs and there\r\nslaughtered that he almost had me in tears too. I felt like a\r\nbeetle-browed brute with a dripping knife and hands imbrued with\r\ninnocent gore.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Mr Pilkington!”\r\n\r\n“Once more you say exactly what he said, only more crisply. I comforted\r\nhim as well as I could, told him all for the best and so on, and he\r\nflung the box-office receipts in my face and said that the piece was as\r\nbad a failure commercially as it was artistically. I couldn’t say\r\nanything to that, seeing what a house we’ve got tonight, except to bid\r\nhim look out to the horizon where the sun will shortly shine. In other\r\nwords, I told him that business was about to buck up and that later on\r\nhe would be going about the place with a sprained wrist from clipping\r\ncoupons. But he refused to be cheered, cursed me some more for ruining\r\nhis piece, and ended by begging me to buy his share of it cheap.”\r\n\r\n“You aren’t going to?”\r\n\r\n“No, I am not—but simply and solely for the reason that, after that\r\nfiasco in London, I raised my right hand—thus—and swore an oath that\r\nnever, as long as I lived, would I again put up a cent for a\r\nproduction, were it the most obvious cinch on earth. I’m gun-shy. But\r\nif he does happen to get hold of any one with a sporting disposition\r\nand a few thousands to invest, that person will make a fortune. This\r\npiece is going to be a gold-mine.”\r\n\r\nJill looked at him in surprise. With anybody else but Wally she would\r\nhave attributed this confidence to author’s vanity. But with Wally, she\r\nfelt, the fact that the piece, as played now, was almost entirely his\r\nown work did not count. He viewed it dispassionately, and she could not\r\nunderstand why, in the face of half-empty houses, he should have such\r\nfaith in it.\r\n\r\n“But what makes you think so? We’ve been doing awfully badly so far.”\r\n\r\nWally nodded.\r\n\r\n“And we shall do awfully badly in Syracuse the last half of this week.\r\nAnd why? For one thing, because the show isn’t a show at all at\r\npresent. That’s what you can’t get these fatheads like Goble to\r\nunderstand. All they go by is the box-office. Why should people flock\r\nto pay for seats for what are practically dress rehearsals of an\r\nunknown play? Half the principals have had to get up in their parts in\r\ntwo weeks, and they haven’t had time to get anything out of them. They\r\nare groping for their lines all the time. The girls can’t let\r\nthemselves go in the numbers, because they are wondering if they are\r\ngoing to remember the steps. The show hasn’t had time to click together\r\nyet. It’s just ragged. Take a look at it in another two weeks! I\r\n_know!_ I don’t say musical comedy is a very lofty form of art, but\r\nstill there’s a certain amount of science about it. If you go in for it\r\nlong enough, you learn the tricks, and take it from me that if you have\r\na good cast and some catchy numbers, it’s almost impossible not to have\r\na success. We’ve got an excellent cast now, and the numbers are fine.\r\nThe thing can’t help being a hit.\r\n\r\n“There’s another thing to think of. It so happens that we shall go into\r\nNew York with practically nothing against us. Usually you have half a\r\ndozen musical successes to compete with, but just at the moment there’s\r\nnothing. But the chief reason for not being discouraged by bad houses\r\nso far is that we’ve been playing bad towns. Every town on the road has\r\nits special character. Some are good show-towns, others are bad. Nobody\r\nknows why. Detroit will take anything. So will Washington. Whereas\r\nCincinnati wants something very special. Where have we been? Atlantic\r\nCity, Baltimore, and here. Atlantic City is a great place to play in\r\nthe summer and for a couple of weeks round about Easter. Also at\r\nChristmas. But for the rest of the year, no. Too many new shows are\r\ntried out there. It makes the inhabitants wary. Baltimore is good for a\r\npiece with a New York reputation, but they don’t want new pieces.\r\nRochester and Syracuse are always bad. ‘Follow the Girl’ died a hideous\r\ndeath in Rochester, and it went on and played two years in New York and\r\none in London. I tell you—as I tried to tell Pilkington, only he\r\nwouldn’t listen—that this show is all right. There’s a fortune in it\r\nfor somebody. But I suppose Pilkington is now sitting in the\r\nsmoking-car of an east-bound train, trying to get the porter to accept\r\nhis share in the piece instead of a tip!”\r\n\r\nIf Otis Pilkington was not actually doing that, he was doing something\r\nlike it. Sunk in gloom, he bumped up and down on an uncomfortable seat,\r\nwondering why he had ever taken the trouble to make the trip to\r\nRochester. He had found exactly what he had expected to find, a mangled\r\ncaricature of his brain-child playing to a house half empty and wholly\r\nindifferent. The only redeeming feature, he thought vindictively, as he\r\nremembered what Roland Trevis had said about the cost of musical\r\nproductions, was the fact that the new numbers were undoubtedly better\r\nthan those which his collaborator had originally supplied.\r\n\r\nAnd “The Rose of America,” after a disheartening Wednesday matinee and\r\na not much better reception on the Wednesday night, packed its baggage\r\nand moved to Syracuse, where it failed just as badly. Then for another\r\ntwo weeks it wandered on from one small town to another, up and down\r\nNew York State and through the doldrums of Connecticut, tacking to and\r\nfro like a storm-battered ship, till finally the astute and discerning\r\ncitizens of Hartford welcomed it with such a reception that hardened\r\nprincipals stared at each other in a wild surmise, wondering if these\r\nthings could really be: and a weary chorus forgot its weariness and\r\ngave encore after encore with a snap and vim which even Mr Johnson\r\nMiller was obliged to own approximated to something like it. Nothing to\r\ntouch the work of his choruses of the old days, of course, but\r\nnevertheless fair, quite fair.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the company revived. Optimism reigned. Principals smiled\r\nhappily and said they had believed in the thing all along. The ladies\r\nand gentlemen of the ensemble chattered contentedly of a year’s run in\r\nNew York. And the citizens of Hartford fought for seats, and, if they\r\ncould not get seats, stood up at the back.\r\n\r\nOf these things Otis Pilkington was not aware. He had sold his interest\r\nin the piece two weeks ago for ten thousand dollars to a lawyer acting\r\nfor some client unknown, and was glad to feel that he had saved\r\nsomething out of the wreck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nThe violins soared to one last high note: the bassoon uttered a final\r\nmoan: the pensive person at the end of the orchestra-pit, just under\r\nMrs Waddesleigh Peagrim’s box, whose duty it was to slam the drum at\r\nstated intervals, gave that much-enduring instrument a concluding\r\nwallop; and, laying aside his weapons, allowed his thoughts to stray in\r\nthe direction of cooling drinks. Mr Saltzburg lowered the baton which\r\nhe had stretched quivering towards the roof and sat down and mopped his\r\nforehead. The curtain fell on the first act of “The Rose of America,”\r\nand simultaneously tremendous applause broke out from all over the\r\nGotham Theatre, which was crammed from floor to roof with that\r\nheterogeneous collection of humanity which makes up the audience of a\r\nNew York opening performance. The applause continued like the breaking\r\nof waves on a stony beach. The curtain rose and fell, rose and fell,\r\nrose and fell again. An usher, stealing down the central aisle, gave to\r\nMr Saltzburg an enormous bouquet of American Beauty roses, which he\r\nhanded to the prima donna, who took it with a brilliant smile and a bow\r\nnicely combining humility with joyful surprise. The applause, which had\r\nbegun to slacken, gathered strength again. It was a superb bouquet,\r\nnearly as big as Mr Saltzburg himself. It had cost the prima donna\r\nclose on a hundred dollars that morning at Thorley’s, but it was worth\r\nevery cent of the money.\r\n\r\nThe house-lights went up. The audience began to move up the aisles to\r\nstretch its legs and discuss the piece during the intermission. There\r\nwas a general babble of conversation. Here, a composer who had not got\r\nan interpolated number in the show was explaining to another composer\r\nwho had not got an interpolated number in the show the exact source\r\nfrom which a third composer who had got an interpolated number in the\r\nshow had stolen the number which he had got interpolated. There, two\r\nmusical comedy artistes who were temporarily resting were agreeing that\r\nthe prima donna was a dear thing but that, contrary as it was to their\r\nlife-long policy to knock anybody, they must say that she was beginning\r\nto show the passage of the years a trifle and ought to be warned by\r\nsome friend that her career as an ingenue was a thing of the past.\r\nDramatic critics, slinking in twos and threes into dark corners, were\r\ntelling each other that “The Rose of America” was just another of those\r\nthings but it had apparently got over. The general public was of the\r\nopinion that it was a knock-out.\r\n\r\n“Otie darling,” said Mrs Waddesleigh Peagrim, leaning her ample\r\nshoulder on Uncle Chris’ perfectly fitting sleeve and speaking across\r\nhim to young Mr Pilkington, “I do congratulate you, dear. It’s\r\nperfectly delightful! I don’t know when I have enjoyed a musical piece\r\nso much. Don’t you think it’s perfectly darling, Major Selby?”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” agreed that suave man of the world, who had been bored as\r\nnear extinction as makes no matter. “Congratulate you, my boy!”\r\n\r\n“You clever, clever thing!” said Mrs Peagrim, skittishly striking her\r\nnephew on the knee with her fan. “I’m proud to be your aunt! Aren’t you\r\nproud to know him, Mr Rooke?”\r\n\r\nThe fourth occupant of the box awoke with a start from the species of\r\nstupor into which he had been plunged by the spectacle of the McWhustle\r\nof McWhustle in action. There had been other dark moments in Freddie’s\r\nlife. Once, back in London, Parker had sent him out into the heart of\r\nthe West End without his spats and he had not discovered their absence\r\ntill he was half-way up Bond Street. On another occasion, having taken\r\non a stranger at squash for a quid a game, he had discovered too late\r\nthat the latter was an ex-public-school champion. He had felt gloomy\r\nwhen he had learned of the breaking-off of the engagement between Jill\r\nMariner and Derek Underhill, and sad when it had been brought to his\r\nnotice that London was giving Derek the cold shoulder in consequence.\r\nBut never in his whole career had he experienced such gloom and such\r\nsadness as had come to him that evening while watching this unspeakable\r\nperson in kilts murder the part that should have been his. And the\r\naudience, confound them, had roared with laughter at every damn silly\r\nthing the fellow had said!\r\n\r\n“Eh?” he replied. “Oh, yes, rather, absolutely!”\r\n\r\n“We’re _all_ proud of you, Otie darling,” proceeded Mrs Peagrim. “The\r\npiece is a wonderful success. You will make a fortune out of it. And\r\njust think, Major Selby, I tried my best to argue the poor, dear boy\r\nout of putting it on! I thought it was so rash to risk his money in a\r\ntheatrical venture. But then,” said Mrs Peagrim in extenuation, “I had\r\nonly seen the piece when it was done at my house at Newport, and of\r\ncourse it really was rather dreadful nonsense then! I might have known\r\nthat you would change it a great deal before you put it on in New York.\r\nAs I always say, plays are not written, they are rewritten! Why, you\r\nhave improved this piece a hundred per cent, Otie! I wouldn’t know it\r\nwas the same play!”\r\n\r\nShe slapped him smartly once more with her fan, ignorant of the gashes\r\nshe was inflicting. Poor Mr Pilkington was suffering twin torments, the\r\ntorture of remorse and the agonized jealousy of the unsuccessful\r\nartist. It would have been bad enough to have to sit and watch a large\r\naudience rocking in its seats at the slap-stick comedy which Wally\r\nMason had substituted for his delicate social satire: but, had this\r\nbeen all, at least he could have consoled himself with the sordid\r\nreflection that he, as owner of the piece, was going to make a lot of\r\nmoney out of it. Now, even this material balm was denied him. He had\r\nsold out, and he was feeling like the man who parts for a song with\r\nshares in an apparently goldless gold mine, only to read in the papers\r\nnext morning that a new reef has been located. Into each life some rain\r\nmust fall. Quite a shower was falling now into young Mr. Pilkington’s.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” went on Mrs Peagrim, “when the play was done at my house,\r\nit was acted by amateurs. And you know what amateurs are! The cast\r\ntonight is perfectly splendid. I do think that Scotchman is the most\r\nkilling creature! Don’t you think he is wonderful, Mr. Rooke?”\r\n\r\nWe may say what we will against the upper strata of Society, but it\r\ncannot be denied that breeding tells. Only by falling back for support\r\non the traditions of his class and the solid support of a gentle\r\nupbringing was the Last of the Rookes able to crush down the words that\r\nleaped to his lips and to substitute for them a politely conventional\r\nagreement. If Mr Pilkington was feeling like a too impulsive seller of\r\ngold-mines, Freddie’s emotions were akin to those of the Spartan boy\r\nwith the fox under his vest. Nothing but Winchester and Magdalen could\r\nhave produced the smile which, though twisted and confined entirely to\r\nhis lips, flashed onto his face and off again at his hostess’ question.\r\n\r\n“Oh, rather! Priceless!”\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t that part an Englishman before?” asked Mrs Peagrim. “I thought\r\nso. Well, it was a stroke of genius changing it. This Scotchman is too\r\nfunny for words. And such an artist!”\r\n\r\nFreddie rose shakily. One can stand just so much.\r\n\r\n“Think,” he mumbled, “I’ll be pushing along and smoking a cigarette.”\r\n\r\nHe groped his way to the door.\r\n\r\n“I’ll come with you, Freddie my boy,” said Uncle Chris, who felt an\r\nimperative need of five minutes’ respite from Mrs Peagrim. “Let’s get\r\nout into the air for a moment. Uncommonly warm it is here.”\r\n\r\nFreddie assented. Air was what he felt he wanted most.\r\n\r\nLeft alone in the box with her nephew, Mrs Peagrim continued for some\r\nmoments in the same vein, innocently twisting the knife in the open\r\nwound. It struck her from time to time that darling Otie was perhaps a\r\nshade unresponsive, but she put this down to the nervous strain\r\ninseparable from a first night of a young author’s first play.\r\n\r\n“Why,” she concluded, “you will make thousands and thousands of dollars\r\nout of this piece. I am sure it is going to be another ‘Merry Widow.’”\r\n\r\n“You can’t tell from a first night audience,” said Mr Pilkington\r\nsombrely, giving out a piece of theatrical wisdom he had picked up at\r\nrehearsals.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you can. It’s so easy to distinguish polite applause from the\r\nreal thing. No doubt many of the people down here have friends in the\r\ncompany or other reasons for seeming to enjoy the play, but look how\r\nthe circle and the gallery were enjoying it! You can’t tell me that\r\nthat was not genuine. They love it. How hard,” she proceeded\r\ncommiseratingly, “you must have worked, poor boy, during the tour on\r\nthe road to improve the piece so much! I never liked to say so before,\r\nbut even you must agree with me now that that original version of\r\nyours, which was done down at Newport, was the most terrible nonsense!\r\nAnd how hard the company must have worked, too! Otie,” cried Mrs\r\nPeagrim, aglow with the magic of a brilliant idea, “I will tell you\r\nwhat you must really do. You must give a supper and dance to the whole\r\ncompany on the stage tomorrow night after the performance.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Otis Pilkington, startled out of his lethargy by this\r\nappalling suggestion. Was he, the man who, after planking down\r\nthirty-two thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine dollars, sixty-eight\r\ncents for “props” and “frames” and “rehl,” had sold out for a paltry\r\nten thousand, to be still further victimized?\r\n\r\n“They do deserve it, don’t they, after working so hard?”\r\n\r\n“It’s impossible,” said Otis Pilkington vehemently. “Out of the\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“But, Otie darling, I was talking to Mr Mason, when he came down to\r\nNewport to see the piece last summer, and he told me that the\r\nmanagement nearly always gives a supper to the company, especially if\r\nthey have had a lot of extra rehearsing to do.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let Goble give them a supper if he wants to.”\r\n\r\n“But you know that Mr Goble, though he has his name on the programme as\r\nthe manager, has really nothing to do with it. You own the piece, don’t\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Mr Pilkington felt an impulse to reveal all, but\r\nrefrained. He knew his Aunt Olive too well. If she found out that he\r\nhad parted at a heavy loss with this valuable property, her whole\r\nattitude towards him would change,—or, rather, it would revert to her\r\nnormal attitude, which was not unlike that of a severe nurse to a\r\nweak-minded child. Even in his agony there had been a certain faint\r\nconsolation, due to the entirely unwonted note of respect in the voice\r\nwith which she had addressed him since the fall of the curtain. He\r\nshrank from forfeiting this respect, unentitled though he was to it.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said in his precise voice. “That, of course, is so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then!” said Mrs Peagrim.\r\n\r\n“But it seems so unnecessary! And think what it would cost.”\r\n\r\nThis was a false step. Some of the reverence left Mrs Peagrim’s voice,\r\nand she spoke a little coldly. A gay and gallant spender herself, she\r\nhad often had occasion to rebuke a tendency to over-parsimony in her\r\nnephew.\r\n\r\n“We must not be mean, Otie!” she said.\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington keenly resented her choice of pronouns. “We” indeed! Who\r\nwas going to foot the bill? Both of them, hand in hand, or he alone,\r\nthe chump, the boob, the easy mark who got this sort of thing wished on\r\nhim!\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it would be possible to get the stage for a\r\nsupper-party,” he pleaded, shifting his ground. “Goble wouldn’t give it\r\nto us.”\r\n\r\n“As if Mr Goble would refuse you anything after you have written a\r\nwonderful success for his theatre! And isn’t he getting his share of\r\nthe profits? Directly after the performance, you must go round and ask\r\nhim. Of course he will be delighted to give you the stage. I will be\r\nhostess,” said Mrs. Peagrim radiantly. “And now, let me see, whom shall\r\nwe invite?”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington stared gloomily at the floor, too bowed down now by his\r\nweight of cares to resent the “we,” which had plainly come to stay. He\r\nwas trying to estimate the size of the gash which this preposterous\r\nentertainment would cleave in the Pilkington bank-roll. He doubted if\r\nit was possible to go through with it under five hundred dollars; and,\r\nif, as seemed only too probable, Mrs Peagrim took the matter in hand\r\nand gave herself her head, it might get into four figures.\r\n\r\n“Major Selby, of course,” said Mrs Peagrim musingly, with a cooing note\r\nin her voice. Long since had that polished man of affairs made a deep\r\nimpression upon her. “Of course Major Selby, for one. And Mr Rooke.\r\nThen there are one or two of my friends who would be hurt if they were\r\nleft out. How about Mr Mason? Isn’t he a friend of yours?”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington snorted. He had endured much and was prepared to endure\r\nmore, but he drew the line at squandering his money on the man who had\r\nsneaked up behind his brain-child with a hatchet and chopped its\r\nprecious person into little bits.\r\n\r\n“He is _not_ a friend of mine,” he said stiffly, “and I do not wish him\r\nto be invited!”\r\n\r\nHaving attained her main objective, Mrs Peagrim was prepared to yield\r\nminor points.\r\n\r\n“Very well, if you do not like him,” she said. “But I thought he was\r\nquite an intimate of yours. It was you who asked me to invite him to\r\nNewport last summer.”\r\n\r\n“Much,” said Mr Pilkington coldly, “has happened since last summer.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well,” said Mrs Peagrim again. “Then we will not include Mr\r\nMason. Now, directly the curtain has fallen, Otie dear, pop right round\r\nand find Mr Goble and tell him what you want.”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nIt is not only twin-souls in this world who yearn to meet each other.\r\nBetween Otis Pilkington and Mr Goble there was little in common, yet,\r\nat the moment when Otis set out to find Mr Goble, the thing which Mr\r\nGoble desired most in the world was an interview with Otis. Since the\r\nend of the first act, the manager had been in a state of mental\r\nupheaval. Reverting to the gold-mine simile again, Mr Goble was in the\r\nposition of a man who has had a chance of purchasing such a mine and\r\nnow, learning too late of the discovery of the reef, is feeling the\r\ntruth of the poet’s dictum that of all sad words of tongue or pen the\r\nsaddest are these—“It might have been.” The electric success of “The\r\nRose of America” had stunned Mr Goble: and, realizing, as he did, that\r\nhe might have bought Otis Pilkington’s share dirt cheap at almost any\r\npoint of the preliminary tour, he was having a bad half hour with\r\nhimself. The only ray in the darkness which brooded on his indomitable\r\nsoul was the thought that it might still be possible, by getting hold\r\nof Mr Pilkington before the notices appeared and shaking his head sadly\r\nand talking about the misleading hopes which young authors so often\r\ndraw from an enthusiastic first-night reception and impressing upon him\r\nthat first-night receptions do not deceive your expert who has been\r\nfifteen years in the show-business and mentioning gloomily that he had\r\nheard a coupla the critics roastin’ the show to beat the band … by\r\ndoing all these things, it might still be possible to depress Mr\r\nPilkington’s young enthusiasm and induce him to sell his share at a\r\nsacrifice price to a great-hearted friend who didn’t think the thing\r\nwould run a week but was willing to buy as a sporting speculation,\r\nbecause he thought Mr Pilkington a good kid and after all these shows\r\nthat flop in New York sometimes have a chance on the road.\r\n\r\nSuch were the meditations of Mr Goble, and, on the final fall of the\r\ncurtain amid unrestrained enthusiasm on the part of the audience, he\r\nhad despatched messengers in all directions with instructions to find\r\nMr Pilkington and conduct him to the presence. Meanwhile, he waited\r\nimpatiently on the empty stage.\r\n\r\nThe sudden advent of Wally Mason, who appeared at this moment, upset Mr\r\nGoble terribly. Wally was a factor in the situation which he had not\r\nconsidered. An infernal, tactless fellow, always trying to make\r\nmischief and upset honest merchants, Wally, if present at the interview\r\nwith Otis Pilkington, would probably try to act in restraint of trade\r\nand would blurt out some untimely truth about the prospects of the\r\npiece. Not for the first time, Mr Goble wished Wally a sudden stroke of\r\napoplexy.\r\n\r\n“Went well, eh?” said Wally amiably. He did not like Mr Goble, but on\r\nthe first night of a successful piece personal antipathies may be sunk.\r\nSuch was his effervescent good-humor at the moment that he was prepared\r\nto treat Mr Goble as a man and a brother.\r\n\r\n“H’m!” replied Mr Goble doubtfully, paving the way.\r\n\r\n“What are you h’ming about?” demanded Wally, astonished. “The thing’s a\r\nriot.”\r\n\r\n“You never know,” responded Mr Goble in the minor key.\r\n\r\n“Well!” Wally stared. “I don’t know what more you want. The audience\r\nsat up on its hind legs and squealed, didn’t they?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve an idea,” said Mr Goble, raising his voice as the long form of Mr\r\nPilkington crossed the stage towards them, “that the critics will roast\r\nit. If you ask _me_,” he went on loudly, “it’s just the sort of show\r\nthe critics will pan the life out of. I’ve been fifteen years in the …”\r\n\r\n“Critics!” cried Wally. “Well, I’ve just been talking to Alexander of\r\nthe _Times_, and he said it was the best musical piece he had ever seen\r\nand that all the other men he had talked to thought the same.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble turned a distorted face to Mr Pilkington. He wished that Wally\r\nwould go. But Wally, he reflected bitterly, was one of those men who\r\nnever go. He faced Mr Pilkington and did the best he could.\r\n\r\n“Of course it’s got a _chance_,” he said gloomily. “Any show has got a\r\n_chance!_ But I don’t know … I don’t know …”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington was not interested in the future prospects of “The Rose\r\nof America.” He had a favor to ask, and he wanted to ask it, have it\r\nrefused if possible, and get away. It occurred to him that, by\r\nsubstituting for the asking of a favor a peremptory demand, he might\r\nsave himself a thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n“I want the stage after the performance tomorrow night, for a supper to\r\nthe company,” he said brusquely.\r\n\r\nHe was shocked to find Mr Goble immediately complaisant.\r\n\r\n“Why, sure,” said Mr Goble readily. “Go as far as you like!” He took Mr\r\nPilkington by the elbow and drew him up-stage, lowering his voice to a\r\nconfidential undertone. “And now, listen,” he said, “I’ve something I\r\nwant to talk to you about. Between you and I and the lamp-post, I don’t\r\nthink this show will last a month in New York. It don’t add up right!\r\nThere’s something all wrong about it.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington assented with an emphasis which amazed the manager. “I\r\nquite agree with you! If you had kept it the way it was originally …”\r\n\r\n“Too late for that!” sighed Mr Goble, realizing that his star was in\r\nthe ascendant. He had forgotten for the moment that Mr Pilkington was\r\nan author. “We must make the best of a bad job! Now, you’re a good kid\r\nand I wouldn’t like you to go around town saying that I had let you in.\r\nIt isn’t business, maybe, but, just because I don’t want you to have\r\nany kick coming, I’m ready to buy your share of the thing and call it a\r\ndeal. After all, it may get money on the road. It ain’t likely, but\r\nthere’s a chance, and I’m willing to take it. Well, listen, I’m\r\nprobably robbing myself, but I’ll give you fifteen thousand, if you\r\nwant to sell.”\r\n\r\nA hated voice spoke at his elbow.\r\n\r\n“I’ll make you a better offer than that,” said Wally. “Give me your\r\nshare of the show for three dollars in cash and I’ll throw in a pair of\r\nsock-suspenders and an Ingersoll. Is it a go?”\r\n\r\nMr Goble regarded him balefully.\r\n\r\n“Who told you to butt in?” he enquired sourly.\r\n\r\n“Conscience!” replied Wally. “Old Henry W. Conscience! I refuse to\r\nstand by and see the slaughter of the innocents. Why don’t you wait\r\ntill he’s dead before you skin him!” He turned to Mr Pilkington. “Don’t\r\nyou be a fool!” he said earnestly. “Can’t you see the thing is the\r\nbiggest hit in years? Do you think Jesse James here would be offering\r\nyou a cent for your share if he didn’t know there was a fortune in it?\r\nDo you imagine … ?”\r\n\r\n“It is immaterial to me,” interrupted Otis Pilkington loftily, “what Mr\r\nGoble offers. I have already sold my interest!”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Mr Goble.\r\n\r\n“When?” cried Wally.\r\n\r\n“I sold it half way through the road-tour,” said Mr Pilkington, “to a\r\nlawyer, acting on behalf of a client whose name I did not learn.”\r\n\r\nIn the silence which followed this revelation, another voice spoke.\r\n\r\n“I should like to speak to you for a moment, Mr Goble, if I may.” It\r\nwas Jill, who had joined the group unperceived.\r\n\r\nMr Goble glowered at Jill, who met his gaze composedly.\r\n\r\n“I’m busy!” snapped Mr Goble. “See me tomorrow!”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer to see you now.”\r\n\r\n“You would prefer!” Mr Goble waved his hands despairingly, as if\r\ncalling on heaven to witness the persecution of a good man.\r\n\r\nJill exhibited a piece of paper stamped with the letter-heading of the\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n“It’s about this,” she said. “I found it in the box as I was going\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“It seems to be a fortnight’s notice.”\r\n\r\n“And that,” said Mr Goble, “is what it _is!_”\r\n\r\nWally uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say … ?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do!” said the manager, turning on him. He felt that he had\r\nout-maneuvred Wally. “I agreed to let her open in New York, and she’s\r\ndone it, hasn’t she? Now she can get out. I don’t want her. I wouldn’t\r\nhave her if you paid me. She’s a nuisance in the company, always making\r\ntrouble, and she can go.”\r\n\r\n“But I would prefer not to go,” said Jill.\r\n\r\n“You would prefer!” The phrase infuriated Mr Goble. “And what has what\r\nyou would prefer got to do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see,” said Jill, “I forgot to tell you before, but I own the\r\npiece!”\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nMr Goble’s jaw fell. He had been waving his hands in another spacious\r\ngesture, and he remained frozen with out-stretched arms, like a\r\nsemaphore. This evening had been a series of shocks for him, but this\r\nwas the worst shock of all.\r\n\r\n“You—what!” he stammered.\r\n\r\n“I own the piece,” repeated Jill. “Surely that gives me authority to\r\nsay what I want done and what I don’t want done.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Mr Goble, who was having difficulty with his vocal\r\nchords, swallowed once or twice. Wally and Mr Pilkington stared dumbly.\r\nAt the back of the stage, a belated scene-shifter, homeward bound, was\r\nwhistling as much as he could remember of the refrain of a popular\r\nsong.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean you own the piece?” Mr Goble at length gurgled.\r\n\r\n“I bought it.”\r\n\r\n“You bought it!”\r\n\r\n“I bought Mr Pilkington’s share through a lawyer for ten thousand\r\ndollars.”\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand dollars! Where did you get ten thousand dollars?” Light\r\nbroke upon Mr Goble. The thing became clear to him. “Damn it!” he\r\ncried. “I might have known you had some man behind you! You’d never\r\nhave been so darned fresh if you hadn’t had some John in the\r\nbackground, paying the bills! Well, of all the …”\r\n\r\nHe broke off abruptly, not because he had said all that he wished to\r\nsay, for he had only touched the fringe of his subject, but because at\r\nthis point Wally’s elbow smote him in the parts about the third button\r\nof his waistcoat and jarred all the breath out of him.\r\n\r\n“Be quiet!” said Wally dangerously. He turned to Jill. “Jill, you don’t\r\nmind telling me how you got ten thousand dollars, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not, Wally. Uncle Chris sent it to me. Do you remember\r\ngiving me a letter from him at Rochester? The check was in that.”\r\n\r\nWally stared.\r\n\r\n“Your uncle! But he hasn’t any money!”\r\n\r\n“He must have made it somehow.”\r\n\r\n“But he couldn’t! How could he?”\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington suddenly gave tongue. He broke in on them with a loud\r\nnoise that was half a snort and half a yell. Stunned by the information\r\nthat it was Jill who had bought his share in the piece, Mr Pilkington’s\r\nmind had recovered slowly and then had begun to work with a quite\r\nunusual rapidity. During the preceding conversation he had been doing\r\nsome tense thinking, and now he saw all.\r\n\r\n“It’s a swindle! It’s a deliberate swindle!” shrilled Mr Pilkington.\r\nThe tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles flashed sparks. “I’ve been made a\r\nfool of! I’ve been swindled! I’ve been robbed!”\r\n\r\nJill regarded him with wide eyes.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean!”\r\n\r\n“I certainly do not! You were perfectly willing to sell the piece.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not talking about that! You know what I mean! I’ve been robbed!”\r\n\r\nWally snatched at his arm as it gyrated past him in a gesture of\r\nanguish which rivalled the late efforts in that direction of Mr Goble,\r\nwho was now leaning against the safety-curtain trying to get his breath\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be a fool,” said Wally curtly. “Talk sense! You know perfectly\r\nwell that Miss Mariner wouldn’t swindle you.”\r\n\r\n“She may not have been in it,” conceded Mr Pilkington. “I don’t know\r\nwhether she was or not. But that uncle of her swindled me out of ten\r\nthousand dollars! The smooth old crook!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk like that about Uncle Chris!” said Jill, her eyes flashing.\r\n“Tell me what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, come on, Pilkington,” said Wally grimly. “You’ve been scattering\r\nsome pretty serious charges about. Let’s hear what you base them on. Be\r\ncoherent for a couple of seconds.”\r\n\r\nMr Goble filled his depleted lungs.\r\n\r\n“If you ask me …” he began.\r\n\r\n“We don’t,” said Wally curtly. “This has nothing to do with you. Well,”\r\nhe went on, “we’re waiting to hear what this is all about.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington gulped. Like most men of weak intellect who are preyed on\r\nby the wolves of the world, he had ever a strong distaste for admitting\r\nthat he had been deceived. He liked to regard himself as a shrewd young\r\nman who knew his way about and could take care of himself.\r\n\r\n“Major Selby,” he said, adjusting his spectacles, which emotion had\r\ncaused to slip down his nose, “came to me a few weeks ago with a\r\nproposition. He suggested the formation of a company to start Miss\r\nMariner in the motion-pictures.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Jill.\r\n\r\n“In the motion-pictures,” repeated Mr Pilkington. “He wished to know if\r\nI cared to advance any capital towards the venture. I thought it over\r\ncarefully and decided that I was favorably disposed towards the scheme.\r\nI …” Mr Pilkington gulped again. “I gave him a check for ten thousand\r\ndollars!”\r\n\r\n“Of all the fools!” said Mr Goble with a sharp laugh. He caught Wally’s\r\neye and subsided once more.\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington’s fingers strayed agitatedly to his spectacles.\r\n\r\n“I may have been a fool,” he cried shrilly, “though I was perfectly\r\nwilling to risk the money, had it been applied to the object for which\r\nI gave it. But when it comes to giving ten thousand dollars just to\r\nhave it paid back to me in exchange for a very valuable piece, of\r\ntheatrical property … my own money … handed back to me … !”\r\n\r\nWords failed Mr Pilkington.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been deliberately swindled!” he added after a moment, harking\r\nback to the main motive.\r\n\r\nJill’s heart was like lead. She could not doubt for an instant the\r\ntruth of what the victim had said. Woven into every inch of the fabric,\r\nplainly hall-marked on its surface, she could perceive the signature of\r\nUncle Chris. If he had come and confessed to her himself, she could not\r\nhave been more certain that he had acted precisely as Mr Pilkington had\r\ncharged. There was that same impishness, that same bland\r\nunscrupulousness, that same pathetic desire to do her a good turn\r\nhowever it might affect anybody else which, if she might compare the\r\ntwo things, had caused him to pass her off on unfortunate Mr Mariner of\r\nBrookport as a girl of wealth with tastes in the direction of real\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nWally was not so easily satisfied.\r\n\r\n“You’ve no proof whatever …”\r\n\r\nJill shook her head.\r\n\r\n“It’s true, Wally. I know Uncle Chris. It must be true.”\r\n\r\n“But, Jill … !”\r\n\r\n“It must be. How else could Uncle Chris have got the money?”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington, much encouraged by this ready acquiescence in his\r\ntheories, got under way once more.\r\n\r\n“The man’s a swindler! A swindler! He’s robbed me! I have been robbed!\r\nHe never had any intention of starting a motion-picture company. He\r\nplanned it all out … !”\r\n\r\nJill cut into the babble of his denunciations. She was sick at heart,\r\nand she spoke almost listlessly.\r\n\r\n“Mr Pilkington!” The victim stopped. “Mr Pilkington, if what you say is\r\ntrue, and I’m afraid there is no doubt that it is, the only thing I can\r\ndo is to give you back your property. So will you please try to\r\nunderstand that everything is just as it was before you gave my uncle\r\nthe money. You’ve got back your ten thousand dollars and you’ve got\r\nback your piece, so there’s nothing more to talk about.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington, dimly realizing that the financial aspect of the affair\r\nhad been more or less satisfactorily adjusted was nevertheless\r\nconscious of a feeling that he was being thwarted. He had much more to\r\nsay about Uncle Chris and his methods of doing business, and it irked\r\nhim to be cut short like this.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I do think. … That’s all very well, but I have by no means\r\nfinished …”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you have,” said Wally.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing more to talk about,” repeated Jill. “I’m sorry this\r\nshould have happened, but you’ve nothing to complain about now, have\r\nyou? Good night.”\r\n\r\nAnd she turned quickly away, and walked towards the door.\r\n\r\n“But I hadn’t _finished!_” wailed Mr Pilkington, clutching at Wally. He\r\nwas feeling profoundly aggrieved. If it is bad to be all dressed up and\r\nno place to go, it is almost worse to be full of talk and to have no\r\none to talk it to. Otis Pilkington had at least another twenty minutes\r\nof speech inside him on the topic of Uncle Chris, and Wally was the\r\nnearest human being with a pair of ears.\r\n\r\nWally was in no mood to play the part of confidant. He pushed Mr\r\nPilkington earnestly in the chest and raced after Jill. Mr Pilkington,\r\nwith the feeling that the world was against him, tottered back into the\r\narms of Mr Goble, who had now recovered his breath and was ready to\r\ntalk business.\r\n\r\n“Have a good cigar,” said Mr Goble, producing one. “Now, see here,\r\nlet’s get right down to it. If you’d care to sell out for twenty\r\nthousand …”\r\n\r\n“I would _not_ care to sell out for twenty thousand!” yelled the\r\noverwrought Mr Pilkington. “I wouldn’t sell out for a million! You’re a\r\nswindler! You want to rob me! You’re a crook!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” assented Mr Goble gently. “But, all joking aside, suppose I\r\nwas to go up to twenty-five thousand … ?” He twined his fingers\r\nlovingly in the slack of Mr Pilkington’s coat. “Come now! You’re a good\r\nkid! Shall we say twenty-five thousand?”\r\n\r\n“We will _not_ say twenty-five thousand! Let me go!”\r\n\r\n“Now, now, _now!_” pleaded Mr Goble. “Be sensible! don’t get all worked\r\nup! Say, _do_ have a good cigar!”\r\n\r\n“I _won’t_ have a good cigar!” shouted Mr Pilkington.\r\n\r\nHe detached himself with a jerk, and stalked with long strides up the\r\nstage. Mr Goble watched him go with a lowering gaze. A heavy sense of\r\nthe unkindness of fate was oppressing Mr Goble. If you couldn’t gyp a\r\nbone-headed amateur out of a piece of property, whom could you gyp? Mr\r\nGoble sighed. It hardly seemed to him worth while going on.\r\n\r\n§ 4.\r\n\r\nOut in the street Wally had overtaken Jill, and they faced one another\r\nin the light of a street lamp. Forty-first Street at midnight is a\r\nquiet oasis. They had it to themselves.\r\n\r\nJill was pale, and she was breathing quickly, but she forced a smile.\r\n\r\n“Well, Wally,” she said. “My career as a manager didn’t last long, did\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\nJill looked down the street.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I suppose I shall have to start trying to\r\nfind something.”\r\n\r\n“But …”\r\n\r\nJill drew him suddenly into the dark alley-way leading to the\r\nstage-door of the Gotham Theatre’s nearest neighbor: and, as she did\r\nso, a long, thin form, swathed in an overcoat and surmounted by an\r\nopera-hat, flashed past.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I could have gone through another meeting with Mr\r\nPilkington,” said Jill. “It wasn’t his fault, and he was quite\r\njustified, but what he said about Uncle Chris rather hurt.”\r\n\r\nWally, who had ideas of his own similar to those of Mr Pilkington on\r\nthe subject of Uncle Chris and had intended to express them, prudently\r\nkept them unspoken.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” he said, “there is no doubt … ?”\r\n\r\n“There can’t be. Poor Uncle Chris! He is like Freddie. He means well!”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. They left the alley and walked down the street.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going now?” asked Wally.\r\n\r\n“I’m going home.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s home?”\r\n\r\n“Forty-ninth Street. I live in a boarding-house there.” A sudden\r\nrecollection of the boarding-house at which she had lived in Atlantic\r\nCity smote Wally, and it turned the scale. He had not intended to\r\nspeak, but he could not help himself.\r\n\r\n“Jill!” he cried. “It’s no good. I _must_ say it! I want to get you out\r\nof all this. I want to take care of you. Why should you go on living\r\nthis sort of life, when. … Why won’t you let me … ?”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Even as he spoke, he realized the futility of what he was\r\nsaying. Jill was not a girl to be won with words.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence for a moment. They crossed Broadway, noisy\r\nwith night traffic, and passed into the stillness on the other side.\r\n\r\n“Wally,” said Jill at last.\r\n\r\nShe was looking straight in front of her. Her voice was troubled.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nJill hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Wally, you wouldn’t want me to marry you if you knew you weren’t the\r\nonly man in the world that mattered to me, would you?”\r\n\r\nThey had reached Sixth Avenue before Wally replied.\r\n\r\n“No!” he said.\r\n\r\nFor an instant, Jill could not have said whether the feeling that shot\r\nthrough her like the abrupt touching of a nerve was relief or\r\ndisappointment. Then suddenly she realized that it was disappointment.\r\nIt was absurd to her to feel disappointed, but at that moment she would\r\nhave welcomed a different attitude in him. If only this problem of hers\r\ncould be taken forcefully out of her hands, what a relief it would be.\r\nIf only Wally, masterfully insistent, would batter down her hesitations\r\nand _grab_ her, knock her on the head and carry her off like a caveman,\r\ncare less about her happiness and concentrate on his own, what a\r\nsolution it would be. … But then he wouldn’t be Wally. … Nevertheless,\r\nJill gave a little sigh. Her new life had changed her already. It had\r\nblunted the sharp edge of her independence. Tonight she was feeling the\r\nneed of some one to lean on—some one strong and cosy and sympathetic\r\nwho would treat her like a little girl and shield her from all the\r\nroughness of life. The fighting spirit had gone out of her, and she was\r\nno longer the little warrior facing the world with a brave eye and a\r\ntilted chin. She wanted to cry and be petted.\r\n\r\n“No!” said Wally again. There had been the faintest suggestion of a\r\ndoubt when he had spoken the word before, but now it shot out like a\r\nbullet. “And I’ll tell you why. I want _you_—and, if you married me\r\nfeeling like that, it wouldn’t be you. I want Jill, the whole Jill, and\r\nnothing but Jill, and, if I can’t have that, I’d rather not have\r\nanything. Marriage isn’t a motion-picture close-up with slow fade-out\r\non the embrace. It’s a partnership, and what’s the good of a\r\npartnership if your heart’s not in it? It’s like collaborating with a\r\nman you dislike. … I believe you wish sometimes—not often, perhaps, but\r\nwhen you’re feeling lonely and miserable—that I would pester and\r\nbludgeon you into marrying me. … What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nJill had started. It was disquieting to have her thoughts read with\r\nsuch accuracy.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” she said.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be any good,” Wally went on “because it wouldn’t be _me_.\r\nI couldn’t keep that attitude up, and I know I should hate myself for\r\never having tried it. There’s nothing in the world I wouldn’t do to\r\nhelp you, though I know it’s no use offering to do anything. You’re a\r\nfighter, and you mean to fight your own battle. It might happen that,\r\nif I kept after you and badgered you and nagged you, one of these days,\r\nwhen you were feeling particularly all alone in the world and tired of\r\nfighting for yourself, you might consent to marry me. But it wouldn’t\r\ndo. Even if you reconciled yourself to it, it wouldn’t do. I suppose,\r\nthe cave-woman sometimes felt rather relieved when everything was\r\nsettled for her with a club, but I’m sure the caveman must have had a\r\nhard time ridding himself of the thought that he had behaved like a cad\r\nand taken a mean advantage. I don’t want to feel like that. I couldn’t\r\nmake you happy if I felt like that. Much better to have you go on\r\nregarding me as a friend … knowing that, if ever your feelings do\r\nchange, that I am right there, waiting.”\r\n\r\n“But by that time _your_ feelings will have changed.”\r\n\r\nWally laughed.\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“You’ll meet some other girl …”\r\n\r\n“I’ve met every girl in the world! None of them will do!” The lightness\r\ncame back into Wally’s voice. “I’m sorry for the poor things, but they\r\nwon’t do! Take ’em away! There’s only one girl in the world for me—oh,\r\nconfound it! why is it that one always thinks in song-titles! Well,\r\nthere it is. I’m not going to bother you. We’re pals. And, as a pal,\r\nmay I offer you my bank-roll?”\r\n\r\n“No!” said Jill. She smiled up at him. “I believe you would give me\r\nyour coat if I asked you for it!”\r\n\r\nWally stopped.\r\n\r\n“Do you want it? Here you are!”\r\n\r\n“Wally, behave! There’s a policeman looking at you!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, if you won’t! It’s a good coat, all the same.”\r\n\r\nThey turned the corner, and stopped before a brown-stone house, with a\r\nlong ladder of untidy steps running up to the front door.\r\n\r\n“Is this where you live?” Wally asked. He looked at the gloomy place\r\ndisapprovingly. “You do choose the most awful places!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t choose them. They’re thrust on me. Yes, this is where I live.\r\nIf you want to know the exact room, it’s the third window up there over\r\nthe front door. Well, good night.”\r\n\r\n“Good night,” said Wally. He paused. “Jill.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I know it’s not worth mentioning, and it’s breaking our agreement to\r\nmention it, but you _do_ understand, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Wally dear, I understand.”\r\n\r\n“I’m round the corner, you know, waiting! And, if you ever _do_ change,\r\nall you’ve got to do is just to come to me and say ‘It’s all right!’ …”\r\n\r\nJill laughed a little shakily.\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t sound very romantic!”\r\n\r\n“Not sound romantic! If you can think of any three words in the\r\nlanguage that sound more romantic, let me have them! Well, never mind\r\nhow they sound, just say them, and watch the result! But you must get\r\nto bed. Good night.”\r\n\r\n“Good night, Wally.”\r\n\r\nShe passed in through the dingy door. It closed behind her, and Wally\r\nstood for some moments staring at it with a gloomy repulsion. He\r\nthought he had never seen a dingier door.\r\n\r\nThen he started to walk back to his apartment. He walked very quickly,\r\nwith clenched hands. He was wondering if after all there was not\r\nsomething to be said for the methods of the caveman when he went\r\na-wooing. Twinges of conscience the caveman may have had when all was\r\nover, but at least he had established his right to look after the woman\r\nhe loved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\n“They tell me … I am told … I am informed … No, one moment, Miss\r\nFrisby.”\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim wrinkled her fair forehead. It has been truly said that\r\nthere is no agony like the agony of literary composition, and Mrs.\r\nPeagrim was having rather a bad time getting the requisite snap and\r\nginger into her latest communication to the press. She bit her lip, and\r\nwould have passed her twitching fingers restlessly through her hair but\r\nfor the thought of the damage which such an action must do to her\r\ncoiffure. Miss Frisby, her secretary, an anaemic and negative young\r\nwoman, waited patiently, pad on knee, and tapped her teeth with her\r\npencil.\r\n\r\n“Please do not make that tapping noise, Miss Frisby,” said the sufferer\r\nquerulously. “I cannot think. Otie, dear, can’t you suggest a good\r\nphrase? You ought to be able to, being an author.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington, who was strewn over an arm-chair by the window, awoke\r\nfrom his meditations, which, to judge from the furrow just above the\r\nbridge of his tortoiseshell spectacles and the droop of his weak chin,\r\nwere not pleasant. It was the morning after the production of “The Rose\r\nof America,” and he had passed a sleepless night, thinking of the harsh\r\nwords he had said to Jill. Could she ever forgive him? Would she have\r\nthe generosity to realize that a man ought not to be held accountable\r\nfor what he says in the moment when he discovers that he has been\r\ncheated, deceived, robbed,—in a word, hornswoggled? He had been\r\nbrooding on this all night, and he wanted to go on brooding now. His\r\naunt’s question interrupted his train of thought.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” he said vaguely, gaping.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t be so absent-minded!” snapped Mrs Peagrim, not unjustifiably\r\nannoyed. “I am trying to compose a paragraph for the papers about our\r\nparty tonight, and I can’t get the right phrase … Read what you’ve\r\nwritten, Miss Frisby.”\r\n\r\nMiss Frisby, having turned a pale eye on the pothooks and twiddleys in\r\nher note-book, translated them in a pale voice.\r\n\r\n“‘Surely of all the leading hostesses in New York Society there can be\r\nfew more versatile than Mrs Waddlesleigh Peagrim. I am amazed every\r\ntime I go to her delightful home on West End Avenue to see the scope\r\nand variety of her circle of intimates. Here you will see an ambassador\r\nwith a fever …’”\r\n\r\n“With a _what?_” demanded Mrs Peagrim sharply.\r\n\r\n“‘Fever,’ I thought you said,” replied Miss Frisby stolidly. “I wrote\r\n‘fever’.”\r\n\r\n“‘Diva.’ Do use your intelligence, my good girl. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“‘Here you will see an ambassador with a diva from the opera,\r\nexchanging the latest gossip from the chancelleries for intimate news\r\nof the world behind the scenes. There, the author of the latest novel\r\ntalking literature to the newest debutante. Truly one may say that Mrs\r\nPeagrim has revived the saloon.’”\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim bit her lip.\r\n\r\n“‘Salon’.”\r\n\r\n“‘Salon’,” said Miss Frisby unemotionally. “‘They tell me, I am told, I\r\nam informed …’” She paused. “That’s all I have.”\r\n\r\n“Scratch out those last words,” said Mrs Peagrim irritably. “You really\r\nare hopeless, Miss Frisby! Couldn’t you see that I had stopped\r\ndictating and was searching for a phrase? Otie, what is a good phrase\r\nfor ‘I am told’?”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington forced his wandering attention to grapple with the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n“‘I hear’,” he suggested at length.\r\n\r\n“Tchah!” ejaculated his aunt. Then her face brightened. “I have it.\r\nTake dictation, please, Miss Frisby. ‘A little bird whispers to me that\r\nthere were great doings last night on the stage of the Gotham Theatre\r\nafter the curtain had fallen on “The Rose of America” which, as\r\neverybody knows, is the work of Mrs Peagrim’s clever young nephew, Otis\r\nPilkington.’” Mrs Peagrim shot a glance at her clever young nephew, to\r\nsee how he appreciated the boost, but Otis’ thoughts were far away once\r\nmore. He was lying on his spine, brooding, brooding. Mrs Peagrim\r\nresumed her dictation. “‘In honor of the extraordinary success of the\r\npiece, Mrs Peagrim, who certainly does nothing by halves, entertained\r\nthe entire company to a supper-dance after the performance. A number of\r\nprominent people were among the guests, and Mrs Peagrim was a radiant\r\nand vivacious hostess. She has never looked more charming. The high\r\njinks were kept up to an advanced hour, and every one agreed that they\r\nhad never spent a more delightful evening.’ There! Type as many copies\r\nas are necessary, Miss Frisby, and send them out this afternoon with\r\nphotographs.”\r\n\r\nMiss Frisby having vanished in her pallid way, the radiant and\r\nvivacious hostess turned on her nephew again.\r\n\r\n“I must say, Otie,” she began complainingly, “that, for a man who has\r\nhad a success like yours, you are not very cheerful. I should have\r\nthought the notices of the piece would have made you the happiest man\r\nin New York.”\r\n\r\nThere was once a melodrama where the child of the persecuted heroine\r\nused to dissolve the gallery in tears by saying “Happiness? What _is_\r\nhappiness, moth-aw?” Mr Pilkington did not use these actual words, but\r\nhe reproduced the stricken infant’s tone with great fidelity.\r\n\r\n“Notices! What are notices to me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t be so affected!” cried Mrs Peagrim. “Don’t pretend that you\r\ndon’t know every word of them by heart!”\r\n\r\n“I have not seen the notices, Aunt Olive,” said Mr Pilkington dully.\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim looked at him with positive alarm. She had never been\r\noverwhelmingly attached to her long nephew, but since his rise to fame\r\nsomething resembling affection had sprung up in her, and his attitude\r\nnow disturbed her.\r\n\r\n“You can’t be well, Otie!” she said solicitously. “Are you ill?”\r\n\r\n“I have a severe headache,” replied the martyr. “I passed a wakeful\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“Let me go and mix you a dose of the most wonderful mixture,” said Mrs.\r\nPeagrim maternally. “Poor boy! I don’t wonder, after all the\r\nnervousness and excitement … You sit quite still and rest. I will be\r\nback in a moment.”\r\n\r\nShe bustled out of the room, and Mr Pilkington sagged back into his\r\nchair. He had hardly got his meditations going once more, when the door\r\nopened and the maid announced “Major Selby.”\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said Uncle Chris breezily, sailing down the fairway\r\nwith outstretched hand. “How are—oh!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, perceiving that Mrs Peagrim was not present and—a\r\nmore disturbing discovery—that Otis Pilkington was. It would be\r\nexaggeration to say that Uncle Chris was embarrassed. That master-mind\r\nwas never actually embarrassed. But his jauntiness certainly ebbed a\r\nlittle, and he had to pull his mustache twice before he could face the\r\nsituation with his customary _aplomb_. He had not expected to find Otis\r\nPilkington here, and Otis was the last man he wished to meet. He had\r\njust parted from Jill, who had been rather plain-spoken with regard to\r\nthe recent financial operations: and, though possessed only of a\r\nrudimentary conscience, Uncle Chris was aware that his next interview\r\nwith young Mr Pilkington might have certain aspects bordering on\r\nawkwardness and he would have liked time to prepare a statement for the\r\ndefence. However, here the man was, and the situation must be faced.\r\n\r\n“Pilkington!” he cried. “My dear fellow! Just the man I wanted to see!\r\nI’m afraid there has been a little misunderstanding. Of course, it has\r\nall been cleared up now, but still I must insist on making a personal\r\nexplanation, really I must insist. The whole matter was a most absurd\r\nmisunderstanding. It was like this …”\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Chris paused in order to devote a couple of seconds to\r\nthought. He had said it was “like this,” and he gave his mustache\r\nanother pull as though he were trying to drag inspiration out of it.\r\nHis blue eyes were as frank and honest as ever, and showed no trace of\r\nthe perplexity in his mind, but he had to admit to himself that, if he\r\nmanaged to satisfy his hearer that all was for the best and that he had\r\nacted uprightly and without blame, he would be doing well.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the commercial side of Mr Pilkington was entirely dormant\r\nthis morning. The matter of the ten thousand dollars seemed trivial to\r\nhim in comparison with the weightier problems which occupied his mind.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Miss Mariner?” he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I have just parted from her. She was upset, poor girl, of course,\r\nexceedingly upset.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington moaned hollowly.\r\n\r\n“Is she very angry with me?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment the utter inexplicability of the remark silenced Uncle\r\nChris. Why Jill should be angry with Mr Pilkington for being robbed of\r\nten thousand dollars, he could not understand, for Jill had told him\r\nnothing of the scene that had taken place on the previous night. But\r\nevidently this point was to Mr Pilkington the nub of the matter, and\r\nUncle Chris, like the strategist he was, rearranged his forces to meet\r\nthe new development.\r\n\r\n“Angry?” he said slowly. “Well, of course …”\r\n\r\nHe did not know what it was all about, but no doubt if he confined\r\nhimself to broken sentences which meant nothing light would shortly be\r\nvouchsafed to him.\r\n\r\n“In the heat of the moment,” confessed Mr Pilkington, “I’m afraid I\r\nsaid things to Miss Mariner which I now regret.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris began to feel on solid ground again.\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear!” he murmured regretfully.\r\n\r\n“I spoke hastily.”\r\n\r\n“Always think before you speak, my boy.”\r\n\r\n“I considered that I had been cheated …”\r\n\r\n“My dear boy!” Uncle Chris’ blue eyes opened wide. “Please! Haven’t I\r\nsaid that I could explain all that? It was a pure misunderstanding …”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t care about that part of it …”\r\n\r\n“Quite right,” said Uncle Chris cordially. “Let bygones be bygones.\r\nStart with a clean slate. You have your money back, and there’s no need\r\nto say another word about it. Let us forget it,” he concluded\r\ngenerously. “And, if I have any influence with Jill, you may count on\r\nme to use it to dissipate any little unfortunate rift which may have\r\noccurred between you.”\r\n\r\n“You think there’s a chance that she might overlook what I said?”\r\n\r\n“As I say, I will use any influence I may possess to heal the breach. I\r\nlike you, my boy. And I am sure that Jill likes you. She will make\r\nallowances for any ill-judged remarks you may have uttered in a moment\r\nof heat.”\r\n\r\nMr Pilkington brightened, and Mrs Peagrim, returning with a\r\nmedicine-glass, was pleased to see him looking so much better.\r\n\r\n“You are a positive wizard, Major Selby,” she said archly. “What have\r\nyou been saying to the poor boy to cheer him up so? He has a bad\r\nheadache this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Headache?” said Uncle Chris, starting like a war-horse that has heard\r\nthe bugle. “I don’t know if I have ever mentioned it, but _I_ used to\r\nsuffer from headaches at one time. Extraordinarily severe headaches. I\r\ntried everything, until one day a man I knew recommended a thing\r\ncalled—don’t know if you have ever heard of it …”\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim, in her rôle of ministering angel, was engrossed with her\r\nerrand of mercy. She was holding the medicine-glass to Mr Pilkington’s\r\nlips, and the seed fell on stony ground.\r\n\r\n“Drink this, dear,” urged Mrs Peagrim.\r\n\r\n“Nervino,” said Uncle Chris.\r\n\r\n“There!” said Mrs Peagrim. “That will make you feel much better. How\r\nwell _you_ always look, Major Selby!”\r\n\r\n“And yet at one time,” said Uncle Chris perseveringly, “I was a martyr\r\n…”\r\n\r\n“I can’t remember if I told you last night about the party. We are\r\ngiving a little supper-dance to the company of Otie’s play after the\r\nperformance this evening. Of course you will come?”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris philosophically accepted his failure to secure the ear of\r\nhis audience. Other opportunities would occur.\r\n\r\n“Delighted,” he said. “Delighted.”\r\n\r\n“Quite a simple, bohemian little affair,” proceeded Mrs Peagrim. “I\r\nthought it was only right to give the poor things a little treat after\r\nthey have all worked so hard.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, certainly. A capital idea.”\r\n\r\n“We shall be quite a small party. If I once started asking anybody\r\noutside our _real_ friends, I should have to ask everybody.”\r\n\r\nThe door opened.\r\n\r\n“Mr Rooke,” announced the maid.\r\n\r\nFreddie, like Mr Pilkington, was a prey to gloom this morning. He had\r\nread one or two of the papers, and they had been disgustingly lavish in\r\ntheir praise of The McWhustle of McWhustle. It made Freddie despair of\r\nthe New York press. In addition to this, he had been woken up at seven\r\no’clock, after going to sleep at three, by the ringing of the telephone\r\nand the announcement that a gentleman wished to see him: and he was\r\nweighed down with that heavy-eyed languor which comes to those whose\r\nnight’s rest is broken.\r\n\r\n“Why, how do you do, Mr Rooke!” said Mrs Peagrim.\r\n\r\n“How-de-do,” replied Freddie, blinking in the strong light from the\r\nwindow. “Hope I’m not barging in and all that sort of thing? I came\r\nround about this party tonight, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes?”\r\n\r\n“Was wondering,” said Freddie, “if you would mind if I brought a friend\r\nof mine along? Popped in on me from England this morning. At seven\r\no’clock,” said Freddie plaintively. “Ghastly hour, what! Didn’t do a\r\nthing to the good old beauty sleep! Well, what I mean to say is, I’d be\r\nawfully obliged if you’d let me bring him along.”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course,” said Mrs Peagrim. “Any friend of yours, Mr Rooke …”\r\n\r\n“Thanks awfully. Special reason why I’d like him to come, and all that.\r\nHe’s a fellow named Underhill. Sir Derek Underhill. Been a pal of mine\r\nfor years and years.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris started.\r\n\r\n“Underhill! Is Derek Underhill in America?”\r\n\r\n“Landed this morning. Routed me out of bed at seven o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do you know him, too, Major Selby?” said Mrs Peagrim. “Then I’m\r\nsure he must be charming!”\r\n\r\n“Charming,” began Uncle Chris in measured tones, “is an adjective which\r\nI cannot …”\r\n\r\n“Well, thanks most awfully,” interrupted Freddie. “It’s fearfully good\r\nof you to let me bring him along. I must be staggering off now. Lot of\r\nthings to do.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, must you go already?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely must. Lot of things to do.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris extended a hand to his hostess.\r\n\r\n“I think I will be going along, too, Mrs Peagrim. I’ll walk a few yards\r\nwith you, Freddie my boy. There are one or two things I would like to\r\ntalk over. Till tonight, Mrs Peagrim.”\r\n\r\n“Till tonight, Major Selby.” She turned to Mr Pilkington as the door\r\nclosed. “What charming manners Major Selby has. So polished. A sort of\r\nold-world courtesy. So smooth!”\r\n\r\n“Smooth,” said Mr Pilkington dourly, “is right!”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris confronted Freddie sternly outside the front door.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean? Good God, Freddie, have you no delicacy?”\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said Freddie blankly.\r\n\r\n“Why are you bringing Underhill to this party? Don’t you realize that\r\npoor Jill will be there? How do you suppose she will feel when she sees\r\nthat blackguard again? The cad who threw her over and nearly broke her\r\nheart!”\r\n\r\nFreddie’s jaw fell. He groped for his fallen eyeglass.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my aunt! Do you think she will be pipped?”\r\n\r\n“A sensitive girl like Jill!”\r\n\r\n“But, listen. Derek wants to marry her.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, absolutely. That’s why he’s come over.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand this. I saw the letter myself which he wrote to\r\nher, breaking off the engagement.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but he’s dashed sorry about all that now. Wishes he had never\r\nbeen such a mug, and all that sort of thing. As a matter of fact,\r\nthat’s why I shot over here in the first place. As an ambassador, don’t\r\nyou know. I told Jill all about it directly I saw her, but she seemed\r\ninclined to give it a miss rather, so I cabled old Derek to pop here in\r\nperson. Seemed to me, don’t you know, that Jill might be more likely to\r\nmake it up and all that if she saw old Derek.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris nodded, his composure restored.\r\n\r\n“Very true. Yes, certainly, my boy, you acted most sensibly. Badly as\r\nUnderhill behaved, she undoubtedly loved him. It would be the best\r\npossible thing that could happen if they could be brought together. It\r\nis my dearest wish to see Jill comfortably settled. I was half hoping\r\nthat she might marry young Pilkington.”\r\n\r\n“Good God! The Pilker!”\r\n\r\n“He is quite a nice young fellow,” argued Uncle Chris. “None too many\r\nbrains, perhaps, but Jill would supply that deficiency. Still, of\r\ncourse, Underhill would be much better.”\r\n\r\n“She ought to marry someone,” said Freddie earnestly. “I mean, all rot\r\na girl like Jill having to knock about and rough it like this.”\r\n\r\n“You’re perfectly right.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Freddie thoughtfully, “the catch in the whole dashed\r\nbusiness is that she’s such a bally independent sort of girl. I mean to\r\nsay, it’s quite possible she may hand Derek the mitten, you know.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, let us hope that she will look more favorably on young\r\nPilkington.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Freddie. “Well, yes. But—well, I wouldn’t call the Pilker a\r\nvery ripe sporting proposition. About sixty to one against is the way I\r\nshould figure it, if I were making a book. It may be just because I’m\r\nfeeling a bit pipped this morning—got turfed out of bed at seven\r\no’clock and all that—but I have an idea that she may give both of them\r\nthe old razz. May be wrong, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hope that you are, my boy,” said Uncle Chris gravely. “For in\r\nthat case I should be forced into a course of action from which I\r\nconfess that I shrink.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t follow.”\r\n\r\n“Freddie, my boy, you are a very old friend of Jill’s and I am her\r\nuncle. I feel that I can speak plainly to you. Jill is the dearest\r\nthing to me in the world. She trusted me, and I failed her. I was\r\nresponsible for the loss of her money, and my one object in life is to\r\nsee her by some means or other in a position equal to the one of which\r\nI deprived her. If she marries a rich man, well and good. That,\r\nprovided she marries him because she is fond of him, will be the very\r\nbest thing that can happen. But if she does not there is another way.\r\nIt may be possible for me to marry a rich woman.”\r\n\r\nFreddie stopped, appalled.\r\n\r\n“Good God! You don’t mean … you aren’t thinking of marrying Mrs\r\nPeagrim!”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t have mentioned names, but, as you have guessed … Yes, if\r\nthe worst comes to the worst, I shall make the supreme sacrifice.\r\nTonight will decide. Goodbye, my boy. I want to look in at my club for\r\na few minutes. Tell Underhill that he has my best wishes.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet he has!” gasped Freddie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nIt is safest for the historian, if he values accuracy, to wait till a\r\nthing has happened before writing about it. Otherwise he may commit\r\nhimself to statements which are not borne out by the actual facts. Mrs\r\nPeagrim, recording in advance the success of her party at the Gotham\r\nTheatre, had done this. It is true that she was a “radiant and\r\nvivacious hostess,” and it is possible, her standard not being very\r\nhigh, that she had “never looked more charming.” But, when, she went on\r\nto say that all present were in agreement that they had never spent a\r\nmore delightful evening, she deceived the public. Uncle Chris, for one;\r\nOtis Pilkington, for another, and Freddie Rooke, for a third, were so\r\nfar from spending a delightful evening that they found it hard to mask\r\ntheir true emotions and keep a smiling face to the world.\r\n\r\nOtis Pilkington, indeed, found it impossible, and, ceasing to try, left\r\nearly. Just twenty minutes after the proceedings had begun, he seized\r\nhis coat and hat, shot out into the night, made off blindly up\r\nBroadway, and walked twice round Central Park before his feet gave out\r\nand he allowed himself to be taken back to his apartment in a taxi. He\r\ntried to tell himself that this was only what he had expected, but was\r\nable to draw no consolation from the fact. He tried to tell himself\r\nthat Jill might change her mind, but hope refused to stir. Jill had\r\nbeen very kind and very sweet and very regretful, but it was only too\r\nmanifest that on the question of becoming Mrs Otis Pilkington her mind\r\nwas made up. She was willing to like him, to be a sister to him, to\r\nwatch his future progress with considerable interest, but she would not\r\nmarry him.\r\n\r\nOne feels sorry for Otis Pilkington in his hour of travail. This was\r\nthe fifth or sixth time that this sort of thing had happened to him,\r\nand he was getting tired of it. If he could have looked into the\r\nfuture—five years almost to a day from that evening—and seen himself\r\nwalking blushfully down the aisle of St. Thomas’ with Roland Trevis’\r\nsister Angela on his arm, his gloom might have been lightened. More\r\nprobably, however, it would have been increased. At the moment, Roland\r\nTrevis’ sister Angela was fifteen, frivolous, and freckled and, except\r\nthat he rather disliked her and suspected her—correctly—of laughing at\r\nhim, amounted to just _nil_ in Mr Pilkington’s life. The idea of\r\nlinking his lot with hers would have appalled him, enthusiastically\r\nthough he was in favor of it five years later.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr Pilkington was unable to look into the future, so his\r\nreflections on this night of sorrow were not diverted from Jill. He\r\nthought sadly of Jill till two-thirty, when he fell asleep in his chair\r\nand dreamed of her. At seven o’clock his Japanese valet, who had been\r\ngiven the night off, returned home, found him, and gave him breakfast.\r\nAfter which, Mr Pilkington went to bed, played three games of\r\nsolitaire, and slept till dinner-time, when he awoke to take up the\r\nburden of life again. He still brooded on the tragedy which had\r\nshattered him. Indeed, it was only two weeks later, when at a dance he\r\nwas introduced to a red-haired girl from Detroit, that he really got\r\nover it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news was conveyed to Freddie Rooke by Uncle Chris. Uncle Chris,\r\nwith something of the emotions of a condemned man on the scaffold\r\nwaiting for a reprieve, had watched Jill and Mr Pilkington go off\r\ntogether into the dim solitude at the back of the orchestra chairs,\r\nand, after an all too brief interval, had observed the latter whizzing\r\nback, his every little movement having a meaning of its own—and that\r\nmeaning one which convinced Uncle Chris that Freddie, in estimating Mr\r\nPilkington as a sixty to one chance, had not erred in his judgment of\r\nform.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris found Freddie in one of the upper boxes, talking to Nelly\r\nBryant. Dancing was going on down on the stage, but Freddie, though\r\nnormally a young man who shook a skilful shoe, was in no mood for\r\ndancing tonight. The return to the scenes of his former triumphs and\r\nthe meeting with the companions of happier days, severed from him by a\r\ntwo-weeks’ notice, had affected Freddie powerfully. Eyeing the happy\r\nthrong below, he experienced the emotions of that Peri who, in the\r\npoem, “at the gate of Eden stood disconsolate.”\r\n\r\nExcusing himself from Nelly and following Uncle Chris into the\r\npassage-way outside the box, he heard the other’s news listlessly. It\r\ncame as no shock to Freddie. He had never thought Mr Pilkington\r\nanything to write home about, and had never supposed that Jill would\r\naccept him. He said as much. Sorry for the chap in a way, and all that,\r\nbut had never imagined for an instant that he would click.\r\n\r\n“Where is Underhill?” asked Uncle Chris, agitated.\r\n\r\n“Derek? Oh, he isn’t here yet.”\r\n\r\n“But why isn’t he here? I understood that you were bringing him with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“That was the scheme, but it seems he had promised some people he met\r\non the boat to go to a theatre and have a bit of supper with them\r\nafterwards. I only heard about it when I got back this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Good God, boy! Didn’t you tell him that Jill would be here tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, rather. And he’s coming on directly he can get away from these\r\npeople. Forget their name, but they’re influential coves who can do him\r\na bit of good and all that sort of thing. The man—the head of the gang,\r\nyou know—is something connected with the Cabinet or the Prime Minister\r\nor something. You’d know his name in a minute if I told you—always\r\nseeing it in the papers—they have pictures of him in _Punch_ a lot—but\r\nI’m rotten at names. Derek did tell me, but it’s slipped the old bean.\r\nWell, he had to leg it with these people, but he’s coming on later.\r\nOught to be here any moment now.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris plucked at his mustache gloomily. Freddie’s detachment\r\ndepressed him. He had looked for more animation and a greater sense of\r\nthe importance of the issue.\r\n\r\n“Well, pip-pip for the present,” said Freddie, moving toward the box.\r\n“Have to be getting back. See you later.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared, and Uncle Chris turned slowly to descend the stairs. As\r\nhe reached the floor below, the door of the stage-box opened, and Mrs\r\nPeagrim came out.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Major Selby!” cried the radiant and vivacious hostess. “I couldn’t\r\nthink where you had got to. I have been looking for you everywhere.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris quivered slightly, but braced himself to do his duty.\r\n\r\n“May I have the pleasure … ?” he began, then broke off as he saw the\r\nman who had come out of the box behind his hostess. “Underhill!” He\r\ngrasped his hand and shook it warmly. “My dear fellow! I had no notion\r\nthat you had arrived!”\r\n\r\n“Sir Derek came just a moment ago,” said Mrs Peagrim.\r\n\r\n“How are you, Major Selby?” said Derek. He was a little surprised at\r\nthe warmth of his reception. He had not anticipated this geniality.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, I’m delighted to see you,” cried Uncle Chris. “But, as\r\nI was saying, Mrs Peagrim, may I have the pleasure of this dance?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I will dance this one,” said Mrs Peagrim surprisingly.\r\n“I’m sure you two must have ever so much to talk about. Why don’t you\r\ntake Sir Derek and give him a cup of coffee?”\r\n\r\n“Capital idea!” said Uncle Chris. “Come this way, my dear fellow. As\r\nMrs Peagrim says, I have ever so much to talk about. Along this\r\npassage, my boy. Be careful. There’s a step. Weil, well, well! It’s\r\ndelightful to see you again!” He massaged Derek’s arm affectionately.\r\nEvery time he had met Mrs Peagrim that evening he had quailed inwardly\r\nat what lay before him, should some hitch occur to prevent the re-union\r\nof Derek and Jill: and, now that the other was actually here, handsomer\r\nthan ever and more than ever the sort of man no girl could resist, he\r\ndeclined to admit the possibility of a hitch. His spirits soared. “You\r\nhaven’t seen Jill yet, of course?”\r\n\r\n“No.” Derek hesitated. “Is Jill … Does she … I mean …”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris resumed his osteopathy. He kneaded his companion’s\r\ncoat-sleeve with a jovial hand.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, of course! I am sure that a word or two from you will\r\nput everything right. We all make mistakes. I have made them myself. I\r\nam convinced that everything will be perfectly all right … Ah, there\r\nshe is. Jill, my dear, here is an old friend to see you!”\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nSince the hurried departure of Mr Pilkington, Jill had been sitting in\r\nthe auditorium, lazily listening to the music and watching the couples\r\ndancing on the stage. She did not feel like dancing herself, but it was\r\npleasant to be there and too much exertion to get up and go home. She\r\nfound herself drifting into a mood of gentle contentment, and was at a\r\nloss to account for this. She was happy,—quietly and peacefully happy,\r\nwhen she was aware that she ought to have been both agitated and\r\napprehensive. When she had anticipated the recent interview with Otis\r\nPilkington, which she had known was bound to come sooner or later, it\r\nhad been shrinkingly and with foreboding. She hated hurting people’s\r\nfeelings, and, though she read Mr Pilkington’s character accurately\r\nenough to know that time would heal any anguish which she might cause\r\nhim, she had had no doubt that the temperamental surface of that long\r\nyoung man, when he succeeded in getting her alone, was going to be\r\nbadly bruised. And it had fallen out just as she had expected. Mr\r\nPilkington had said his say and departed, a pitiful figure, a spectacle\r\nwhich should have wrung her heart. It had not wrung her heart. Except\r\nfor one fleeting instant when she was actually saying the fatal words,\r\nit had not interfered with her happiness at all; and already she was\r\nbeginning to forget that the incident had ever happened.\r\n\r\nAnd, if the past should have depressed her, the future might have been\r\nexpected to depress her even more. There was nothing in it, either\r\nimmediate or distant, which could account for her feeling gently\r\ncontented. The future was a fog, into which she had to grope her way\r\nblindly. She could not see a step ahead. And yet, as she leaned back in\r\nher seat, her heart was dancing in time to the dance-music of Mrs\r\nPeagrim’s hired orchestra. It puzzled Jill.\r\n\r\nAnd then, quite suddenly yet with no abruptness or sense of discovery,\r\njust as if it were something which she had known all along, the truth\r\ncame upon her. It was Wally, the thought of Wally, the knowledge that\r\nWally existed, that made her happy. He was a solid, comforting,\r\nreassuring fact in a world of doubts and perplexities. She did not need\r\nto be with him to be fortified, it was enough just to think of him.\r\nPresent or absent, his personality heartened her like fine weather or\r\nmusic or a sea-breeze,—or like that friendly, soothing night-light\r\nwhich they used to leave in her nursery when she was little, to scare\r\naway the goblins and see her safely over the road that led to the gates\r\nof the city of dreams.\r\n\r\nSuppose there were no Wally …\r\n\r\nJill gave a sudden gasp, and sat up, tingling. She felt as she had\r\nsometimes felt as a child, when, on the edge of sleep, she had dreamed\r\nthat she was stepping off a precipice and had woken, tense and alert,\r\nto find that there was no danger after all. But there was a difference\r\nbetween that feeling and this. She had woken, but to find that there\r\nwas danger. It was as though some inner voice was calling to her to be\r\ncareful, to take thought. Suppose there were no Wally? … And why should\r\nthere always be Wally? He had said confidently enough that there would\r\nnever be another girl … But there were thousands of other girls,\r\nmillions of other girls, and could she suppose that one of them would\r\nnot have the sense to snap up a treasure like Wally? A sense of blank\r\ndesolation swept over Jill. Her quick imagination, leaping ahead, had\r\nmade the vague possibility of a distant future an accomplished fact.\r\nShe felt, absurdly, a sense of overwhelming loss.\r\n\r\nInto her mind, never far distant from it, came the thought of Derek.\r\nAnd, suddenly, Jill made another discovery. She was thinking of Derek,\r\nand it was not hurting. She was thinking of him quite coolly and\r\nclearly and her heart was not aching.\r\n\r\nShe sat back and screwed her eyes tight, as she had always done when\r\npuzzled. Something had happened to her, but how it had happened and\r\nwhen it had happened and why it had happened she could not understand.\r\nShe only knew that now for the first time she had been granted a moment\r\nof clear vision and was seeing things truly.\r\n\r\nShe wanted Wally. She wanted him in the sense that she could not do\r\nwithout him. She felt nothing of the fiery tumult which had come upon\r\nher when she first met Derek. She and Wally would come together with a\r\nsmile and build their life on an enduring foundation of laughter and\r\nhappiness and good-fellowship. Wally had never shaken and never would\r\nshake her senses as Derek had done. If that was love, then she did not\r\nlove Wally. But her clear vision told her that it was not love. It\r\nmight be the blazing and crackling of thorns, but it was not the fire.\r\nShe wanted Wally. She needed him as she needed the air and the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes, and saw Uncle Chris coming down the aisle towards\r\nher. There was a man with him, and, as they moved closer in the dim\r\nlight, Jill saw that it was Derek.\r\n\r\n“Jill, my dear,” said Uncle Chris, “here is an old friend to see you!”\r\n\r\nAnd, having achieved their bringing together, he proceeded to withdraw\r\ndelicately whence he had come. It is pleasant to be able to record that\r\nhe was immediately seized upon by Mrs Peagrim, who had changed her mind\r\nabout not dancing, and led off to be her partner in a fox-trot, in the\r\ncourse of which she trod on his feet three times.\r\n\r\n“Why, Derek!” said Jill cheerfully. She got up and moved down the line\r\nof seats. Except for a mild wonder how he came to be there, she found\r\nherself wholly unaffected by the sight of him. “Whatever are _you_\r\ndoing here?”\r\n\r\nDerek sat down beside her. The cordiality of her tone had relieved yet\r\nat the same time disconcerted him. Man seldom attains to perfect\r\ncontentment in this world, and Derek, while pleased that Jill\r\napparently bore him no ill-will, seemed to miss something in her manner\r\nwhich he would have been glad to find there.\r\n\r\n“Jill!” he said huskily.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Derek only decent to speak huskily. To his orderly mind\r\nthis situation could be handled only in one way. It was a plain,\r\nstraight issue of the strong man humbling himself—not too much, of\r\ncourse, but sufficiently: and it called, in his opinion, for the low\r\nvoice, the clenched hand, and the broken whisper. Speaking as he had\r\nspoken, he had given the scene the right key from the start,—or would\r\nhave done if she had not got in ahead of him and opened it on a note of\r\nabsurd cheeriness. Derek found himself resenting her cheeriness. Often\r\nas he had attempted during the voyage from England to visualize to\r\nhimself this first meeting, he had never pictured Jill smiling brightly\r\nat him. It was a jolly smile, and made her look extremely pretty, but\r\nit jarred upon him. A moment before he had been half relieved, half\r\ndisconcerted: now he was definitely disconcerted. He searched in his\r\nmind for a criticism of her attitude, and came to the conclusion that\r\nwhat was wrong with it was that it was too friendly. Friendliness is\r\nwell enough in its way, but in what should have been a tense clashing\r\nof strong emotions it did not seem to Derek fitting.\r\n\r\n“Did you have a pleasant trip?” asked Jill. “Have you come over on\r\nbusiness?”\r\n\r\nA feeling of bewilderment came upon Derek. It was wrong, it was all\r\nwrong. Of course, she might be speaking like this to cloak intense\r\nfeeling, but, if so, she had certainly succeeded. From her manner, he\r\nand she might be casual acquaintances. A pleasant trip! In another\r\nminute she would be asking him how he had come out on the sweepstake on\r\nthe ship’s run. With a sense of putting his shoulder to some heavy\r\nweight and heaving at it, he sought to lift the conversation to a\r\nhigher plane.\r\n\r\n“I came to find _you!_” he said; still huskily but not so huskily as\r\nbefore. There are degrees of huskiness, and Derek’s was sharpened a\r\nlittle by a touch of irritation.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Jill.\r\n\r\nDerek was now fermenting. What she ought to have said, he did not know,\r\nbut he knew that it was not “Yes?” “Yes?” in the circumstances was\r\nalmost as bad as “Really?”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Jill was looking at him with a frank and\r\nunembarrassed gaze which somehow deepened his sense of annoyance. Had\r\nshe looked at him coldly, he could have understood and even appreciated\r\nit. He had been expecting coldness, and had braced himself to combat\r\nit. He was still not quite sure in his mind whether he was playing the\r\nrole of a penitent or a King Cophetua, but in either character he might\r\nhave anticipated a little temporary coldness, which it would have been\r\nhis easy task to melt. But he had never expected to be looked at as if\r\nhe were a specimen in a museum, and that was how he was feeling now.\r\nJill was not looking at him—she was inspecting him, examining him, and\r\nhe chafed under the process.\r\n\r\nJill, unconscious of the discomfort she was causing, continued to gaze.\r\nShe was trying to discover in just what respect he had changed from the\r\ngod he had been. Certainly not in looks. He was as handsome as\r\never,—handsomer, indeed, for the sunshine and clean breezes of the\r\nAtlantic had given him an exceedingly becoming coat of tan. And yet he\r\nmust have changed, for now she could look upon him quite\r\ndispassionately and criticize him without a tremor. It was like seeing\r\na copy of a great painting. Everything was there, except the one thing\r\nthat mattered, the magic and the glamour. It was like … She suddenly\r\nremembered a scene in the dressing-room when the company had been in\r\nBaltimore. Lois Denham, duly the recipient of the sunburst which her\r\nfriend Izzy had promised her, had unfortunately, in a spirit of girlish\r\ncuriosity, taken it to a jeweller to be priced, and the jeweller had\r\nblasted her young life by declaring it a paste imitation. Jill recalled\r\nhow the stricken girl—previous to calling Izzy on the long distance and\r\ntelling him a number of things which, while probably not news to him,\r\nmust have been painful hearing—had passed the vile object round the\r\ndressing-room for inspection. The imitation was perfect. It had been\r\nimpossible for the girls to tell that the stones were not real\r\ndiamonds. Yet the jeweller, with his sixth sense, had seen through them\r\nin a trifle under ten seconds. Jill come to the conclusion that her\r\nnewly-discovered love for Wally Mason had equipped her with a sixth\r\nsense, and that by its aid she was really for the first time seeing\r\nDerek as he was.\r\n\r\nDerek had not the privilege of being able to read Jill’s thoughts. All\r\nhe could see was the outer Jill, and the outer Jill, as she had always\r\ndone, was stirring his emotions. Her daintiness afflicted him. Not for\r\nthe first, the second, or the third time since they had come into each\r\nother’s lives, he was astounded at the strength of the appeal which\r\nJill had for him when they were together, as contrasted with its\r\nweakness when they were apart. He made another attempt to establish the\r\nscene on a loftier plane.\r\n\r\n“What a fool I was!” he sighed. “Jill! Can you ever forgive me?”\r\n\r\nHe tried to take her hand. Jill skilfully eluded him.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course I’ve forgiven you, Derek, if there was anything to\r\nforgive.”\r\n\r\n“Anything to forgive!” Derek began to get into his stride. These were\r\nthe lines on which he had desired the interview to develop. “I was a\r\nbrute! A cad!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!”\r\n\r\n“I was. Oh, I have been through hell!”\r\n\r\nJill turned her head away. She did not want to hurt him, but nothing\r\ncould have kept her from smiling. She had been so sure that he would\r\nsay that sooner or later.\r\n\r\n“Jill!” Derek had misinterpreted the cause of her movement, and had\r\nattributed it to emotion. “Tell me that everything is as it was\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nJill turned.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I can’t say that, Derek.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not!” agreed Derek in a comfortable glow of manly remorse.\r\nHe liked himself in the character of the strong man abased. “It would\r\nbe too much, to expect, I know. But, when we are married …”\r\n\r\n“Do you really want to marry me?”\r\n\r\n“Jill!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder!”\r\n\r\n“How can you doubt it?”\r\n\r\nJill looked at him.\r\n\r\n“Have you thought what it would mean?”\r\n\r\n“What it would mean?”\r\n\r\n“Well, your mother …”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Derek dismissed Lady Underhill with a grand gesture.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” persisted Jill, “but, if she disapproved of your marrying me\r\nbefore, wouldn’t she disapprove a good deal more now, when I haven’t a\r\npenny in the world and am just in the chorus …”\r\n\r\nA sort of strangled sound proceeded from Derek’s throat.\r\n\r\n“In the chorus!”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you know? I thought Freddie must have told you.”\r\n\r\n“In the chorus!” Derek stammered. “I thought you were here as a guest\r\nof Mrs Peagrim’s.”\r\n\r\n“So I am,—like all the rest of the company.”\r\n\r\n“But … But …”\r\n\r\n“You see, it would be bound to make everything a little difficult,”\r\nsaid Jill. Her face was grave, but her lips were twitching. “I mean,\r\nyou are rather a prominent man, aren’t you, and if you married a\r\nchorus-girl …”\r\n\r\n“Nobody would know,” said Derek limply.\r\n\r\nJill opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Nobody would _know!_” She laughed. “But, of course, you’ve never met\r\nour press-agent. If you think that nobody would know that a girl in the\r\ncompany had married a baronet who was a member of parliament and\r\nexpected to be in the Cabinet in a few years, you’re wronging him! The\r\nnews would be on the front page of all the papers the very next\r\nday—columns of it, with photographs. There would be articles about it\r\nin the Sunday papers. Illustrated! And then it would be cabled to\r\nEngland and would appear in the papers there … You see, you’re a very\r\nimportant person, Derek.”\r\n\r\nDerek sat clutching the arms of his chair. His face was chalky. Though\r\nhe had never been inclined to underestimate his importance as a figure\r\nin the public eye, he had overlooked the disadvantages connected with\r\nsuch an eminence. He gurgled wordlessly. He had been prepared to brave\r\nLady Underhill’s wrath and assert his right to marry whom he pleased,\r\nbut this was different.\r\n\r\nJill watched him curiously and with a certain pity. It was so easy to\r\nread what was passing in his mind. She wondered what he would say, how\r\nhe would flounder out of his unfortunate position. She had no illusions\r\nabout him now. She did not even contemplate the possibility of chivalry\r\nwinning the battle which was going on within him.\r\n\r\n“It would be very awkward, wouldn’t it?” she said.\r\n\r\nAnd then pity had its way with Jill. He had treated her badly; for a\r\ntime she had thought that he had crushed all the heart out of her: but\r\nhe was suffering, and she hated to see anybody suffer.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” she said, “I’m engaged to somebody else.”\r\n\r\nAs a suffocating man, his lips to the tube of oxygen, gradually comes\r\nback to life, Derek revived,—slowly as the meaning of her words sank\r\ninto his mind, then with a sudden abruptness.\r\n\r\n“What!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to marry somebody else. A man named Wally Mason.”\r\n\r\nDerek swallowed. The chalky look died out of his face, and he flushed\r\nhotly. His eyes, half relieved, half indignant, glowed under their\r\npent-house of eyebrow. He sat for a moment in silence.\r\n\r\n“I think you might have told me before!” he said huffily.\r\n\r\nJill laughed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose I ought to have told you before.”\r\n\r\n“Leading me on … !”\r\n\r\nJill patted him on the arm.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, Derek! It’s all over now. And it was great fun, wasn’t\r\nit!”\r\n\r\n“Fun!”\r\n\r\n“Shall we go and dance? The music is just starting.”\r\n\r\n“I _won’t_ dance!”\r\n\r\nJill got up.\r\n\r\n“I must,” she said. “I’m so happy I can’t keep still. Well, good-bye,\r\nDerek, in case I don’t see you again. It was nice meeting after all\r\nthis time. You haven’t altered a bit!”\r\n\r\nDerek watched her flit down the aisle, saw her jump up the little\r\nladder onto the stage, watched her vanish into the swirl of the dance.\r\nHe reached for a cigarette, opened his case, and found it empty. He\r\nuttered a mirthless, Byronic laugh. The thing seemed to him symbolic.\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nNot having a cigarette of his own, Derek got up and went to look for\r\nthe only man he knew who could give him one: and after a search of a\r\nfew minutes came upon Freddie all alone in a dark corner, apart from\r\nthe throng. It was a very different Freddie from the moody youth who\r\nhad returned to the box after his conversation with Uncle Chris. He was\r\nleaning against a piece of scenery with his head tilted back and a beam\r\nof startled happiness on his face. So rapt was he in his reflections\r\nthat he did not become aware of Derek’s approach until the latter\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n“Got a cigarette, Freddie?”\r\n\r\nFreddie withdrew his gaze from the roof.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, old son! Cigarette? Certainly and by all means. Cigarettes?\r\nWhere are the cigarettes? Mr. Rooke, forward! Show cigarettes.” He\r\nextended his case to Derek, who helped himself in sombre silence,\r\nfinding his boyhood’s friend’s exuberance hard to bear. “I say, Derek,\r\nold scream, the most extraordinary thing has happened! You’ll never\r\nguess. To cut a long story short and come to the blow-out of the\r\nscenario, I’m engaged! Engaged, old crumpet! You know what I\r\nmean—engaged to be married!”\r\n\r\n“Uh?” said Derek gruffly, frowning over his cigarette.\r\n\r\n“Don’t wonder you’re surprised,” said Freddie, looking at him a little\r\nwistfully, for his friend had scarcely been gushing, and he would have\r\nwelcomed a bit of enthusiasm. “Can hardly believe it myself.”\r\n\r\nDerek awoke to a sense of the conventions.\r\n\r\n“Congratulate you,” he said. “Do I know her?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, but you soon will. She’s a girl in the company,—in the\r\nchorus, as a matter of fact. Girl named Nelly Bryant. An absolute\r\ncorker. I’ll go further—a topper. You’ll like her, old man.”\r\n\r\nDerek was looking at him, amazed.\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Extraordinary how these things happen,” proceeded Freddie. “Looking\r\nback, I can see, of course, that I always thought her a topper, but the\r\nidea of getting engaged—I don’t know—sort of thing that doesn’t occur\r\nto a chappie, if you know what I mean. What I mean to say is, we had\r\nalways been the greatest of pals and all that, but it never struck me\r\nthat she would think it much of a wheeze getting hooked up for life\r\nwith a chap like me. We just sort of drifted along and so forth. All\r\nvery jolly and what not. And then this evening—I don’t know. I had a\r\nbit of a hump, what with one thing and another, and she was most dashed\r\nsweet and patient and soothing and—and—well, and what not, don’t you\r\nknow, and suddenly—deuced rummy sensation—the jolly old scales seemed\r\nto fall, if you follow me, from my good old eyes; I don’t know if you\r\nget the idea. I suddenly seemed to look myself squarely in the eyeball\r\nand say to myself, ‘Freddie, old top, how do we go? Are we not missing\r\na good thing?’ And, by Jove, thinking it over, I found that I was\r\nabsolutely correct-o! You’ve no notion how dashed sympathetic she is,\r\nold man! I mean to say, I had this hump, you know, owing to one thing\r\nand another, and was feeling that life was more or less of a jolly old\r\nsnare and delusion, and she bucked me up and all that, and suddenly I\r\nfound myself kissing her and all that sort of rot, and she was kissing\r\nme and so on and so forth, and she’s got the most ripping eyes, and\r\nthere was nobody about, and the long and the short of it was, old boy,\r\nthat I said, ‘Let’s get married!’ and she said, ‘When?’ and that was\r\nthat, if you see what I mean. The scheme now is to pop down to the City\r\nHall and get a license, which it appears you have to have if you want\r\nto bring this sort of binge off with any success and vim, and then what\r\nho for the padre! Looking at it from every angle, a bit of a good egg,\r\nwhat! Happiest man in the world, and all that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nAt this point in his somewhat incoherent epic Freddie paused. It had\r\noccurred to him that he had perhaps laid himself open to a charge of\r\nmonopolizing the conversation.\r\n\r\n“I say! You’ll forgive my dwelling a bit on this thing, won’t you?\r\nNever found a girl who would look twice at me before, and it’s rather\r\nunsettled the old bean. Just occurred to me that I may have been\r\ntalking about my own affairs a bit. Your turn now, old thing. Sit down,\r\nas the blighters in the novels used to say, and tell me the story of\r\nyour life. You’ve seen Jill, of course?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Derek shortly.\r\n\r\n“And it’s all right, eh? Fine! We’ll make a double wedding of it, what?\r\nNot a bad idea, that! I mean to say, the man of God might make a\r\nreduction for quantity and shade his fee a bit. Do the job half price!”\r\n\r\nDerek threw down the end of his cigarette, and crushed it with his\r\nheel. A closer observer than Freddie would have detected long ere this\r\nthe fact that his demeanor was not that of a happy and successful\r\nwooer.\r\n\r\n“Jill and I are not going to be married,” he said.\r\n\r\nA look of blank astonishment came into Freddie’s cheerful face. He\r\ncould hardly believe that he had heard correctly. It is true that, in\r\ngloomier mood, he had hazarded the theory to Uncle Chris that Jill’s\r\nindependence might lead her to refuse Derek, but he had not really\r\nbelieved in the possibility of such a thing even at the time, and now,\r\nin the full flood of optimism consequent on his own engagement, it\r\nseemed even more incredible.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!” he cried. “Did she give you the raspberry?”\r\n\r\nIt is to be doubted whether the pride of the Underhills would have\r\npermitted Derek to reply in the affirmative, even if Freddie had\r\nphrased his question differently: but the brutal directness of the\r\nquery made such a course impossible for him. Nothing was dearer to\r\nDerek than his self-esteem, and, even at the expense of the truth, he\r\nwas resolved to shield it from injury. To face Freddie and confess that\r\nany girl in the world had given him, Derek Underhill, what he coarsely\r\ntermed the raspberry was a task so revolting as to be utterly beyond\r\nhis powers.\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the kind!” he snapped. “It was because we both saw that the\r\nthing would be impossible. Why didn’t you tell me that Jill was in the\r\nchorus of this damned piece?”\r\n\r\nFreddie’s mouth slowly opened. He was trying not to realize the meaning\r\nof what his friend was saying. His was a faithful soul, and for\r\nyears—to all intents and purposes for practically the whole of his\r\nlife—he had looked up to Derek and reverenced him. He absolutely\r\nrefused to believe that Derek was intending to convey what he seemed to\r\nbe trying to convey: for, if he was, well … by Jove … it was too rotten\r\nand Algy Martyn had been right after all and the fellow was simply …\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean, old man,” said Freddie with an almost pleading note in\r\nhis voice, “that you’re going to back out of marrying Jill because\r\nshe’s in the chorus?”\r\n\r\nDerek looked away, and scowled. He was finding Freddie, in the capacity\r\nof inquisitor, as trying as he had found him in the rôle of exuberant\r\n_fiancé_. It offended his pride to have to make explanations to one\r\nwhom he had always regarded with a patronizing tolerance as not a bad\r\nfellow in his way but in every essential respect negligible.\r\n\r\n“I have to be sensible,” he said, chafing as the indignity of his\r\nposition intruded itself more and more. “You know what it would mean …\r\nParagraphs in all the papers … photographs … the news cabled to England\r\n… everybody reading it and misunderstanding … I’ve got my career to\r\nthink of … It would cripple me …”\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed off, and there was silence for a moment. Then Freddie\r\nburst into speech. His good-natured face was hard with unwonted scorn.\r\nIts cheerful vacuity had changed to stony contempt. For the second time\r\nin the evening the jolly old scales had fallen from Freddie’s good old\r\neyes, and, as Jill had done, he saw Derek as he was.\r\n\r\n“My sainted aunt!” he said slowly. “So that’s it, what! Well, I’ve\r\nalways thought a dashed lot of you, as you know. I’ve always looked up\r\nto you as a bit of a nib and wished I was like you. But, great Scott!\r\nif that’s the sort of a chap you are, I’m deuced glad I’m not! I’m\r\ngoing to wake up in the middle of the night and think how unlike you I\r\nam and pat myself on the back! Ronny Devereux was perfectly right. A\r\ntick’s a tick, and that’s all there is to say about it. Good old Ronny\r\ntold me what you were, and, like a silly ass, I wasted a lot of time\r\ntrying to make him believe you weren’t that sort of chap at all. It’s\r\nno good standing there looking like your mother,” said Freddie firmly.\r\n“This is where we jolly well part brass-rags! If we ever meet again,\r\nI’ll trouble you not to speak to me, because I’ve a reputation to keep\r\nup! So there you have it in a bally nutshell!”\r\n\r\nScarcely had Freddie ceased to administer it to his former friend in a\r\nbally nutshell, when Uncle Chris, warm and dishevelled from the dance\r\nas interpreted by Mrs Waddesleigh Peagrim, came bustling up, saving\r\nDerek the necessity of replying to the harangue.\r\n\r\n“Well, Underhill, my dear fellow,” began Uncle Chris affably, attaching\r\nhimself to the other’s arm, “what … ?”\r\n\r\nHe broke off, for Derek, freeing his arm with a wrench, turned and\r\nwalked rapidly away. Derek had no desire to go over the whole thing\r\nagain with Uncle Chris. He wanted to be alone, to build up, painfully\r\nand laboriously, the ruins of his self-esteem. The pride of the\r\nUnderhills had had a bad evening.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris turned to Freddie.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” he asked blankly.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what’s the jolly old matter!” cried Freddie. “The\r\nblighter isn’t going to marry poor Jill after all! He’s changed his\r\nrotten mind! It’s off!”\r\n\r\n“Off?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely off!”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely off?”\r\n\r\n“Napoo!” said Freddie. “He’s afraid of what will happen to his blasted\r\ncareer if he marries a girl who’s been in the chorus.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear boy!” Uncle Chris blinked. “But, my dear boy! This is\r\nridiculous … Surely, if I were to speak a word …”\r\n\r\n“You can if you like. _I_ wouldn’t speak to the cootie again if you\r\npaid me! But it won’t do any good, so what’s the use?”\r\n\r\nSlowly Uncle Chris adjusted his mind to the disaster.\r\n\r\n“Then you mean … ?”\r\n\r\n“It’s off!” said Freddie.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Uncle Chris stood motionless. Then, with a sudden jerk, he\r\nseemed to stiffen his backbone. His face was bleak, but he pulled at\r\nhis mustache jauntily.\r\n\r\n“_Morituri te salutant!_” he said. “Good-bye, Freddie, my boy.”\r\n\r\nHe turned away, gallant and upright, the old soldier.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n“Over the top!” said Uncle Chris.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I am going,” said Uncle Chris steadily, “to find Mrs Peagrim!”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” cried Freddie. He followed him, protesting weakly, but the\r\nother gave no sign that he had heard. Freddie saw him disappear into\r\nthe stage-box, and, turning, found Jill at his elbow.\r\n\r\n“Where did Uncle Chris go?” asked Jill. “I want to speak to him.”\r\n\r\n“He’s in the stage-box, with Mrs Peagrim.”\r\n\r\n“With Mrs Peagrim?”\r\n\r\n“Proposing to her,” said Freddie solemnly.\r\n\r\nJill stared.\r\n\r\n“Proposing to Mrs Peagrim? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nFreddie drew her aside, and began to explain.\r\n\r\n§ 4.\r\n\r\nIn the dimness of the stage-box, his eyes a little glassy and a dull\r\ndespair in his soul, Uncle Chris was wondering how to begin. In his hot\r\nyouth he had been rather a devil of a fellow in between dances, a\r\ncoo-er of soft phrases and a stealer of never very stoutly withheld\r\nkisses. He remembered one time in Bangalore … but that had nothing to\r\ndo with the case. The point was, how to begin with Mrs Peagrim. The\r\nfact that twenty-five years ago he had crushed in his arms beneath the\r\nshadows of the deodars a girl whose name he had forgotten, though he\r\nremembered that she had worn a dress of some pink stuff, was immaterial\r\nand irrelevant. Was he to crush Mrs Peagrim in his arms? Not, thought\r\nUncle Chris to himself, on a bet. He contented himself for the moment\r\nwith bending an intense gaze upon her and asking if she was tired.\r\n\r\n“A little,” panted Mrs Peagrim, who, though she danced often and\r\nvigorously, was never in the best of condition, owing to her habit of\r\nneutralizing the beneficient effects of exercise by surreptitious\r\ncandy-eating. “I’m a little out of breath.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris had observed this for himself, and it had not helped him to\r\nface his task. Lovely woman loses something of her queenly dignity when\r\nshe puffs. Inwardly, he was thinking how exactly his hostess resembled\r\nthe third from the left of a troupe of performing sea-lions which he\r\nhad seen some years ago on one of his rare visits to a vaudeville\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“You ought not to tire yourself,” he said with a difficult tenderness.\r\n\r\n“I am so fond of dancing,” pleaded Mrs Peagrim. Recovering some of her\r\nbreath, she gazed at her companion with a sort of short-winded\r\narchness. “You are always so sympathetic, Major Selby.”\r\n\r\n“Am I?” said Uncle Chris. “Am I?”\r\n\r\n“You know you are!”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris swallowed quickly.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you have ever wondered,” he began, and stopped. He felt\r\nthat he was not putting it as well as he might. “I wonder if it has\r\never struck you that there’s a reason.” He stopped again. He seemed to\r\nremember reading something like that in an advertisement in a magazine,\r\nand he did not want to talk like an advertisement. “I wonder if it has\r\never struck you, Mrs. Peagrim,” he began again, “that any sympathy on\r\nmy part might be due to some deeper emotion which … Have you never\r\nsuspected that you have never suspected …” Uncle Chris began to feel\r\nthat he must brace himself up. Usually a man of fluent speech, he was\r\nnot at his best tonight. He was just about to try again, when he caught\r\nhis hostess’ eye, and the soft gleam in it sent him cowering back into\r\nthe silence as if he wore taking cover from an enemy’s shrapnel.\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim touched him on the arm.\r\n\r\n“You were saying … ?” she murmured encouragingly.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris shut his eyes. His fingers pressed desperately into the\r\nvelvet curtain beside him. He felt as he had felt when a raw lieutenant\r\nin India, during his first hill-campaign, when the etiquette of the\r\nservice had compelled him to rise and walk up and down in front of his\r\nmen under a desultory shower of jezail-bullets. He seemed to hear the\r\ndamned things _whop-whopping_ now … and almost wished that he could\r\nreally hear them. One or two good bullets just now would be a welcome\r\ndiversion.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Mrs Peagrim.\r\n\r\n“Have you never felt,” babbled Uncle Chris, “that, feeling as I feel, I\r\nmight have felt … that is to say, might be feeling a feeling … ?”\r\n\r\nThere was a tap at the door of the box. Uncle Chris started violently.\r\nJill came in.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I beg your pardon,” she said. “I wanted to speak …”\r\n\r\n“You wanted to speak to me?” said Uncle Chris, bounding up. “Certainly,\r\ncertainly, certainly, of course. If you will excuse me for a moment?”\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim bowed coldly. The interruption had annoyed her. She had no\r\nnotion who Jill was, and she resented the intrusion at this particular\r\njuncture intensely. Not so Uncle Chris, who skipped out into the\r\npassage like a young lamb.\r\n\r\n“Am I in time?” asked Jill in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“In time?”\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean. Uncle Chris, listen to me! You are not to\r\npropose to that awful woman. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The die is cast!”\r\n\r\n“The die isn’t anything of the sort,” said Jill. “Unless … .” She\r\nstopped, aghast. “You don’t mean that you have done it already?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no. To be perfectly accurate, no. But …”\r\n\r\n“Then that’s all right. I know why you were doing it, and it was very\r\nsweet of you, but you mustn’t.”\r\n\r\n“But, Jill, you don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“I do understand.”\r\n\r\n“I have a motive …”\r\n\r\n“I know your motive. Freddie told me. Don’t you worry yourself about\r\nme, dear, because I am all right. I am going to be married.”\r\n\r\nA look of ecstatic relief came into Uncle Chris’ face.\r\n\r\n“Then Underhill … ?”\r\n\r\n“I am not marrying Derek. Somebody else. I don’t think you know him,\r\nbut I love him, and so will you.” She pulled his face down and kissed\r\nhim. “Now you can go back.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris was almost too overcome to speak. He gulped a little.\r\n\r\n“Jill,” he said shakily, “this is a … this is a great relief.”\r\n\r\n“I knew it would be.”\r\n\r\n“If you are really going to marry a rich man …”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say he was rich.”\r\n\r\nThe joy ebbed from Uncle Chris’ face.\r\n\r\n“If he is not rich, if he cannot give you everything of which I …”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t be absurd! Wally has all the money anybody needs. What’s\r\nmoney?”\r\n\r\n“What’s money?” Uncle Chris stared. “Money, my dear child, is … is …\r\nwell, you mustn’t talk of it in that light way. But, if you think you\r\nwill really have enough … ?”\r\n\r\n“Of course we shall. Now you can go back. Mrs Peagrim will be wondering\r\nwhat has become of you.”\r\n\r\n“Must I?” said Uncle Chris doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Of course. You must be polite.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Uncle Chris. “But it will be a little difficult to\r\ncontinue the conversation on what you might call general lines.\r\nHowever!”\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in the box, Mrs Peagrim was fanning herself with manifest\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n“What did that girl want?” she demanded.\r\n\r\nUncle Chris seated himself with composure. The weakness had passed, and\r\nhe was himself again.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing, nothing. Some trivial difficulty, which I was able to\r\ndispose of in a few words.”\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim would have liked to continue her researches, but a feeling\r\nthat it was wiser not to stray too long from the main point restrained\r\nher. She bent towards him.\r\n\r\n“You were going to say something when that girl interrupted us.”\r\n\r\nUncle Chris shot his cuffs with a debonair gesture.\r\n\r\n“Was I? Was I? To be sure, yes. I was saying that you ought not to let\r\nyourself get tired. Deuce of a thing, getting tired. Plays the dickens\r\nwith the system.”\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim was disconcerted. The atmosphere seemed to have changed,\r\nand she did not like it. She endeavored to restore the tone of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“You are so sympathetic,” she sighed, feeling that she could not do\r\nbetter than to begin again at that point. The remark had produced good\r\nresults before, and it might do so a second time.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” agreed Uncle Chris cheerily. “You see, I have seen something of\r\nall this sort of thing, and I realize the importance of it. I know what\r\nall this modern rush and strain of life is for a woman in your\r\nposition. Parties every night … dancing … a thousand and one calls on\r\nthe vitality … bound to have an effect sooner or later,\r\nunless—_unless_,” said Uncle Chris solemnly, “one takes steps. Unless\r\none acts in time. I had a friend—” His voice sank—“I had a very dear\r\nfriend over in London, Lady Alice—but the name would convey nothing—the\r\npoint is that she was in exactly the same position as you. On the rush\r\nall the time. Never stopped. The end was inevitable. She caught cold,\r\nhadn’t sufficient vitality to throw it off, went to a dance in\r\nmid-winter, contracted pneumonia …” Uncle Chris sighed. “All over in\r\nthree days,” he said sadly. “Now at that time,” he resumed, “I did not\r\nknow what I know now. If I had heard of Nervino then …” He shook his\r\nhead. “It might have saved her life. It _would_ have saved her life. I\r\ntell you, Mrs Peagrim, that there is nothing, there is no lack of\r\nvitality which Nervino cannot set right. I am no physician myself, I\r\nspeak as a layman, but it acts on the red corpuscles of the blood …”\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim’s face was stony. She had not spoken before, because he had\r\ngiven her no opportunity, but she spoke now in a hard voice.\r\n\r\n“Major Selby!”\r\n\r\n“Mrs Peagrim?”\r\n\r\n“I am not interested in patent medicines!”\r\n\r\n“One can hardly call Nervino that,” said Uncle Chris reproachfully. “It\r\nis a sovereign specific. You can get it at any drug-store. It comes in\r\ntwo sizes, the dollar-fifty—or large—size, and the …”\r\n\r\nMrs Peagrim rose majestically.\r\n\r\n“Major Selby, I am tired …”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. And, as I say, Nervino …”\r\n\r\n“Please,” said Mrs. Peagrim coldly, “go to the stage-door and see if\r\nyou can find my limousine. It should be waiting in the street.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Uncle Chris. “Why, certainly, certainly, certainly.”\r\n\r\nHe left the box and proceeded across the stage. He walked with a lissom\r\njauntiness. His eye was bright. One or two of those whom he passed on\r\nhis way had the idea that this fine-looking man was in pain. They\r\nfancied that he was moaning. But Uncle Chris was not moaning. He was\r\nhumming a gay snatch from the lighter music of the ’nineties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\nUp on the roof of his apartment, far above the bustle and clamor of the\r\nbusy city, Wally Mason, at eleven o’clock on the morning after Mrs\r\nPeagrim’s bohemian party, was greeting the new day, as was his custom,\r\nby going through his ante-breakfast exercises. Mankind is divided into\r\ntwo classes, those who do setting-up exercises before breakfast and\r\nthose who know they ought to but don’t. To the former and more\r\npraiseworthy class Wally had belonged since boyhood. Life might be vain\r\nand the world a void, but still he touched his toes the prescribed\r\nnumber of times and twisted his muscular body about according to the\r\nritual. He did so this morning a little more vigorously than usual,\r\npartly because he had sat up too late the night before and thought too\r\nmuch and smoked too much, with the result that he had risen heavy-eyed,\r\nat the present disgraceful hour, and partly because he hoped by\r\nwearying the flesh to still the restlessness of the spirit. Spring\r\ngenerally made Wally restless, but never previously had it brought him\r\nthis distracted feverishness. So he lay on his back and waved his legs\r\nin the air, and it was only when he had risen and was about to go still\r\nfurther into the matter that he perceived Jill standing beside him.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!!” said Wally.\r\n\r\n“Don’t stop,” said Jill. “I’m enjoying it.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you been here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I only just arrived. I rang the bell, and the nice old lady who is\r\ncooking your lunch told me you were out here.”\r\n\r\n“Not lunch. Breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“Breakfast! At this hour?”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you join me?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll join you. But I had my breakfast long ago.”\r\n\r\nWally found his despondency magically dispelled. It was extraordinary\r\nhow the mere sight of Jill could make the world a different place. It\r\nwas true the sun had been shining before her arrival, but in a flabby,\r\nweak-minded way, not with the brilliance it had acquired immediately he\r\nheard her voice.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind waiting for about three minutes while I have a\r\nshower and dress …”\r\n\r\n“Oh, is the entertainment over?” asked Jill, disappointed. “I always\r\narrive too late for everything.”\r\n\r\n“One of these days you shall see me go through the whole programme,\r\nincluding shadow-boxing and the goose-step. Bring your friends! But at\r\nthe moment I think it would be more of a treat for you to watch me eat\r\nan egg. Go and look at the view. From over there you can see Hoboken.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen it. I don’t think much of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, on this side we have Brooklyn. There is no stint. Wander\r\nto and fro and enjoy yourself. The rendezvous is in the sitting-room in\r\nabout four moments.”\r\n\r\nWally vaulted through the passage-window, and disappeared. Then he\r\nreturned and put his head out.\r\n\r\n“I say!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Just occurred to me. Your uncle won’t be wanting this place for half\r\nan hour or so, will he? I mean, there will be time for me to have a\r\nbite of breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose he will require your little home till some time in the\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\n“Fine!”\r\n\r\nWally disappeared again, and a few moments later Jill heard the faint\r\nsplashing of water. She walked to the parapet and looked down. On the\r\nwindows of the nearer buildings the sun cast glittering beams, but\r\nfurther away a faint, translucent mist hid the city. There was Spring\r\nhumidity in the air. In the street she had found it oppressive: but on\r\nthe breezy summit of this steel-and-granite cliff the air was cool and\r\nexhilarating. Peace stole into Jill’s heart as she watched the boats\r\ndropping slowly down the East River, which gleamed like dull steel\r\nthrough the haze. She had come to Journey’s End, and she was happy.\r\nTrouble and heart-ache seemed as distant as those hurrying black ants\r\ndown on the streets. She felt far away from the world on an enduring\r\nmountain of rest. She gave a little sigh of contentment, and turned to\r\ngo in as Wally called.\r\n\r\nIn the sitting-room her feeling of security deepened. Here, the world\r\nwas farther away than ever. Even the faint noises which had risen to\r\nthe roof were inaudible, and only the cosy tick-tock of the\r\ngrandfather’s clock punctuated the stillness.\r\n\r\nShe looked at Wally with a quickening sense of affection. He had the\r\ndivine gift of silence at the right time. Yes, this was home. This was\r\nwhere she belonged.\r\n\r\n“It didn’t take me in, you know,” said Jill at length, resting her arms\r\non the table and regarding him severely.\r\n\r\nWally looked up.\r\n\r\n“What didn’t take you in?”\r\n\r\n“That bath of yours. Yes, I know you turned on the cold shower, but you\r\nstood at a safe distance and watched it _show!_”\r\n\r\nWally waved his fork.\r\n\r\n“As Heaven is my witness. … Look at my hair! Still damp! And I can show\r\nyou the towel.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I’ll bet it was the hot water. Why weren’t you at Mrs\r\nPeagrim’s party last night?”\r\n\r\n“It would take too long to explain all my reasons, but one of them was\r\nthat I wasn’t invited. How did it go off?”\r\n\r\n“Splendidly. Freddie’s engaged!”\r\n\r\nWally lowered his coffee cup.\r\n\r\n“Engaged! You don’t mean what is sometimes slangily called bethrothed?”\r\n\r\n“I do. He’s engaged to Nelly Bryant. Nelly told me all about it when\r\nshe got home last night. It seems that Freddie said to her ‘What ho!’\r\nand she said ‘You bet!’ and Freddie said ‘Pip pip!’ and the thing was\r\nsettled.” Jill bubbled. “Freddie wants to go into vaudeville with her!”\r\n\r\n“No! The Juggling Rookes? Or Rooke and Bryant, the cross-talk team, a\r\nthoroughly refined act, swell dressers on and off?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. But it doesn’t matter. Nelly is domestic. She’s going to\r\nhave a little home in the country, where she can grow chickens and\r\npigs.”\r\n\r\n“‘Father’s in the pigstye, you can tell him by his hat,’ eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. They will be very happy. Freddie will be a father to her parrot.”\r\n\r\nWally’s cheerfulness diminished a trifle. The contemplation of\r\nFreddie’s enviable lot brought with it the inevitable contrast with his\r\nown. A little home in the country … Oh, well!\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Jill was looking a little grave.\r\n\r\n“Wally!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nShe turned her face away, for there was a gleam of mischief in her eyes\r\nwhich she did not wish him to observe.\r\n\r\n“Derek was at the party!”\r\n\r\nWally had been about to butter a piece of toast. The butter, jerked\r\nfrom the knife by the convulsive start which he gave, popped up in a\r\nsemi-circle and plumped onto the tablecloth. He recovered himself\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n“Sorry!” he said. “You mustn’t mind that. They want me to be\r\nsecond-string for the ‘Boosting the Butter’ event at the next Olympic\r\nGames, and I’m practising all the time. … Underhill was there, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You met him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nDerek fiddled with his knife.\r\n\r\n“Did he come over … I mean … had he come specially to see you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I see.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause.\r\n\r\n“He wants to marry you?”\r\n\r\n“He said he wanted to marry me.”\r\n\r\nWally got up and went to the window. Jill could smile safely now, and\r\nshe did, but her voice was still grave.\r\n\r\n“What ought I to do, Wally? I thought I would ask you, as you are such\r\na friend.”\r\n\r\nWally spoke without turning.\r\n\r\n“You ought to marry him, of course.”\r\n\r\n“You think so?”\r\n\r\n“You ought to marry him, of course,” said Wally doggedly. “You love\r\nhim, and the fact that he came all the way to America must mean that he\r\nstill loves you. Marry him!”\r\n\r\n“But …” Jill hesitated. “You see, there’s a difficulty.”\r\n\r\n“What difficulty?”\r\n\r\n“Well … it was something I said to him just before he went away. I said\r\nsomething that made it a little difficult.”\r\n\r\nWally continued to inspect the roofs below.\r\n\r\n“What did you say?”\r\n\r\n“Well … it was something … something that I don’t believe he liked …\r\nsomething that may interfere with his marrying me.”\r\n\r\n“What did you say?”\r\n\r\n“I told him I was going to marry _you!_”\r\n\r\nWally spun round. At the same time he leaped in the air. The effect of\r\nthe combination of movements was to cause him to stagger across the\r\nroom and, after two or three impromptu dance steps which would have\r\ninterested Mrs Peagrim, to clutch at the mantelpiece to save himself\r\nfrom falling. Jill watched him with quiet approval.\r\n\r\n“Why, that’s wonderful, Wally! Is that another of your morning\r\nexercises? If Freddie does go into vaudeville, you ought to get him to\r\nlet you join the troupe.”\r\n\r\nWally was blinking at her from the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n“Jill!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“What—what—what … !”\r\n\r\n“Now, don’t talk like Freddie, even if you are going into vaudeville\r\nwith him.”\r\n\r\n“You said you were going to marry _me?_”\r\n\r\n“I said I was going to marry you!”\r\n\r\n“But—do you mean … ?”\r\n\r\nThe mischief died out of Jill’s eyes. She met his gaze frankly and\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n“The lumber’s gone, Wally,” she said. “But my heart isn’t empty. It’s\r\nquite, quite full, and it’s going to be full for ever and ever and\r\never.”\r\n\r\nWally left the mantelpiece, and came slowly towards her.\r\n\r\n“Jill!” He choked. “Jill!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he pounced on her and swung her off her feet. She gave a\r\nlittle breathless cry.\r\n\r\n“Wally! I thought you didn’t approve of cavemen!”\r\n\r\n“This,” said Wally, “is just another new morning exercise I’ve thought\r\nof!”\r\n\r\nJill sat down, gasping.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to do that often, Wally?”\r\n\r\n“Every day for the rest of my life!”\r\n\r\n“Goodness!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’ll get used to it. It’ll grow on you.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t think I am making a mistake marrying you?”\r\n\r\n“No, no! I’ve given the matter a lot of thought, and … in fact, no,\r\nno!”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jill thoughtfully. “I think you’ll make a good husband. I\r\nmean, suppose we ever want the piano moved or something … Wally!” she\r\nbroke off suddenly.\r\n\r\n“You have our ear.”\r\n\r\n“Come out on the roof,” said Jill. “I want to show you something\r\nfunny.”\r\n\r\nWally followed her out. They stood at the parapet together, looking\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n“There!” said Jill, pointing.\r\n\r\nWally looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“I see many things, but which is the funny one?”\r\n\r\n“Why, all those people. Over there—and there—and there. Scuttering\r\nabout and thinking they know everything there is to know, and not one\r\nof them has the least idea that I am the happiest girl on earth!”\r\n\r\n“Or that I’m the happiest man! Their ignorance is—what is the word I\r\nwant? Abysmal. They don’t know what it’s like to stand beside you and\r\nsee that little dimple in your chin. … They don’t know you’ve _got_ a\r\nlittle dimple in your chin. … They don’t know. … They don’t know … Why,\r\nI don’t suppose a single one of them even knows that I’m just going to\r\nkiss you!”\r\n\r\n“Those girls in that window over there do,” said Jill. “They are\r\nwatching us like hawks.”\r\n\r\n“Let ’em!” said Wally briefly.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note: While I left several variant spellings such as\r\nvodevil and bethrothed, I did correct the following:\r\n\r\nFixed: course/coarse in\r\nYet somehow this course, rough person in front of him never seemed to\r\nallow him a word\r\n\r\nFixed: awfuly/awfully in:\r\nHe’s awfuly good to girls who’ve worked in shows for him before.\r\n\r\nFixed: Pullfan/Pullman\r\nThose Pullfan porters on parade!”\r\n\r\nFixed: a large typo in the print edition, which originally read:\r\n“Yes. I’ve got the most damned attack of indigestion.” Derek should\r\nrecline in the arm-chair which he had vacated; dinner!”"
