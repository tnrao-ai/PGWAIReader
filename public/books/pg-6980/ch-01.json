He was disgusted, mortified; no other word for\r\nit. He had no objection, of course, to Mr Mellish saying that his work\r\nduring the term, and especially his Livy, had been disgraceful. A\r\nmaster has the right to say that sort of thing if he likes. It is one\r\nof the perquisites of the position. But when he went on to observe,\r\nwithout a touch of shame, that there would be an examination in the\r\nLivy as far as they had gone in it on the following Saturday,\r\nPillingshot felt that he exceeded. It was not playing the game. There\r\nwere the examinations at the end of term. Those were fair enough. You\r\nknew exactly when they were coming, and could make your arrangements\r\naccordingly. But to spring an examination on you in the middle of the\r\nterm out of a blue sky, as it were, was underhand and unsportsmanlike,\r\nand would not do at all. Pillingshot wished that he could put his foot\r\ndown. He would have liked to have stalked up to Mr Mellish's desk,\r\nfixed him with a blazing eye, and remarked, 'Sir, withdraw that remark.\r\nCancel that statement instantly, or--!' or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nWhat he did say was: 'Oo, si-i-r!!'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Mr Mellish, not troubling to conceal his triumph\r\nat Pillingshot's reception of the news, 'there will be a Livy\r\nexamination next Saturday. And--' (he almost intoned this last\r\nobservation)--'anybody who does not get fifty per cent, Pillingshot,\r\nfifty per cent, will be severely punished. Very severely punished,\r\nPillingshot.'\r\n\r\nAfter which the lesson had proceeded on its course.\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is rather low, isn't it?' said Pillingshot's friend, Parker,\r\nas Pillingshot came to the end of a stirring excursus on the rights of\r\nthe citizen, with special reference to mid-term Livy examinations.\r\n'That's the worst of Mellish. He always has you somehow.'\r\n\r\n'But what am I to _do_?' raved Pillingshot.\r\n\r\n'I should advise you to swot it up before Saturday,' said Parker.\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't be an ass,' said Pillingshot, irritably.\r\n\r\nWhat was the good of friends if they could only make idiotic\r\nsuggestions like that?\r\n\r\nHe retired, brooding, to his house.\r\n\r\nThe day was Wednesday. There were only two more days, therefore, in\r\nwhich to prepare a quarter of a book of Livy. It couldn't be done. The\r\nthing was not possible.\r\n\r\nIn the house he met Smythe.\r\n\r\n'What are you going to do about it?' he inquired. Smythe was top of the\r\nform, and if he didn't know how to grapple with a crisis of this sort,\r\nwho _could_ know?\r\n\r\n'If you'll kindly explain,' said Smythe, 'what the dickens you are\r\ntalking about, I might be able to tell you.'\r\n\r\nPillingshot explained, with unwonted politeness, that 'it' meant the\r\nLivy examination.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Smythe, airily, 'that! I'm just going to skim through it in\r\ncase I've forgotten any of it. Then I shall read up the notes\r\ncarefully. And then, if I have time, I shall have a look at the history\r\nof the period. I should advise you to do that, too.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't be a goat,' said Pillingshot.\r\n\r\nAnd he retired, brooding, as before.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon he spent industriously, copying out the fourth book of\r\n_The Aeneid_. At the beginning of the week he had had a slight\r\ndisagreement with M. Gerard, the French master.\r\n\r\nPillingshot's views on behaviour and deportment during French lessons\r\ndid not coincide with those of M. Gerard. Pillingshot's idea of a\r\nFrench lesson was something between a pantomime rally and a scrum at\r\nfootball. To him there was something wonderfully entertaining in the\r\nprocess of 'barging' the end man off the edge of the form into space,\r\nand upsetting his books over him. M. Gerard, however, had a very\r\nundeveloped sense of humour. He warned the humorist twice, and on the\r\nthing happening a third time, suggested that he should go into extra\r\nlesson on the ensuing Wednesday.\r\n\r\nSo Pillingshot went, and copied out Virgil.\r\n\r\nHe emerged from the room of detention at a quarter past four. As he\r\ncame out into the grounds he espied in the middle distance somebody\r\nbeing carried on a stretcher in the direction of the School House. At\r\nthe same moment Parker loomed in sight, walking swiftly towards the\r\nSchool shop, his mobile features shining with the rapt expression of\r\none who sees much ginger-beer in the near future.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Parker,' said Pillingshot, 'who's the corpse?'\r\n\r\n'What, haven't you heard?' said Parker. 'Oh, no, of course, you were in\r\nextra. It's young Brown. He's stunned or something.'\r\n\r\n'How did it happen?'\r\n\r\n'That rotter, Babington, in Dacre's. Simply slamming about, you know,\r\ngetting his eye in before going in, and Brown walked slap into one of\r\nhis drives. Got him on the side of the head.'\r\n\r\n'Much hurt?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, I don't think so. Keep him out of school for about a week.'\r\n\r\n'Lucky beast. Wish somebody would come and hit me on the head. Come\r\nand hit me on the head, Parker.'\r\n\r\n'Come and have an ice,' said Parker.\r\n\r\n'Right-ho,' said Pillingshot. It was one of his peculiarities, that\r\nwhatever the hour or the state of the weather, he was always equal to\r\nconsuming an ice. This was probably due to genius. He had an infinite\r\ncapacity for taking pains. Scarcely was he outside the promised ice\r\nwhen another misfortune came upon him. Scott, of the First Eleven,\r\nentered the shop. Pillingshot liked Scott, but he was not blind to\r\ncertain flaws in the latter's character. For one thing, he was too\r\nenergetic. For another, he could not keep his energy to himself. He was\r\nalways making Pillingshot do things. And Pillingshot's notion of the\r\nideal life was complete _dolce far niente_.\r\n\r\n'Ginger-beer, please,' said Scott, with parched lips. He had been\r\nbowling at the nets, and the day was hot. 'Hullo! Pillingshot, you\r\nyoung slacker, why aren't you changed? Been bunking half-holiday games?\r\nYou'd better reform, young man.'\r\n\r\n'I've been in extra,' said Pillingshot, with dignity.\r\n\r\n'How many times does that make this term? You're going for the record,\r\naren't you? Jolly sporting of you. Bit slow in there, wasn't it?\r\n'Nother ginger-beer, please.'\r\n\r\n'Just a bit,' said Pillingshot.\r\n\r\n'I thought so. And now you're dying for some excitement. Of course you\r\nare. Well, cut over to the House and change, and then come back and\r\nfield at the nets. The man Yorke is going to bowl me some of his\r\ncelebrated slow tosh, and I'm going to show him exactly how Jessop does\r\nit when he's in form.'\r\n\r\nScott was the biggest hitter in the School. Mr Yorke was one of the\r\nmasters. He bowled slow leg-breaks, mostly half-volleys and long hops.\r\nPillingshot had a sort of instinctive idea that fielding out in the\r\ndeep with Mr Yorke bowling and Scott batting would not contribute\r\nlargely to the gaiety of his afternoon. Fielding deep at the nets meant\r\nthat you stood in the middle of the football field, where there was no\r\ntelling what a ball would do if it came at you along the ground. If you\r\nwere lucky you escaped without injury. Generally, however, the ball\r\nbumped and deprived you of wind or teeth, according to the height to\r\nwhich it rose. He began politely, but firmly, to excuse himself.\r\n\r\n'Don't talk rot,' said Scott, complainingly, 'you must have some\r\nexercise or you'll go getting fat. Think what a blow it would be to\r\nyour family, Pillingshot, if you lost your figure. Buck up. If you're\r\nback here in a quarter of an hour you shall have another ice. A large\r\nice, Pillingshot, price sixpence. Think of it.'\r\n\r\nThe word ice, as has been remarked before, touched chords in\r\nPillingshot's nature to which he never turned a deaf ear. Within the\r\nprescribed quarter of an hour he was back again, changed.\r\n\r\n'Here's the ice,' said Scott, 'I've been keeping it warm for you.\r\nShovel it down. I want to be starting for the nets. Quicker, man,\r\nquicker! Don't roll it round your tongue as if it was port. Go for it.\r\nFinished? That's right. Come on.'\r\n\r\nPillingshot had not finished, but Scott so evidently believed that he\r\nhad, that it would have been unkind to have mentioned the fact. He\r\nfollowed the smiter to the nets.\r\n\r\nIf Pillingshot had passed the earlier part of the afternoon in a\r\nsedentary fashion, he made up for it now. Scott was in rare form, and\r\nPillingshot noticed with no small interest that, while he invariably\r\nhit Mr Yorke's deliveries a quarter of a mile or so, he never hit two\r\nballs in succession in the same direction. As soon as the panting\r\nfieldsman had sprinted to one side of the football ground and returned\r\nthe ball, there was a beautiful, musical _plonk_, and the ball\r\nsoared to the very opposite quarter of the field. It was a fine\r\nexhibition of hitting, but Pillingshot felt that he would have enjoyed\r\nit more if he could have watched it from a deck-chair.\r\n\r\n'You're coming on as a deep field, young Pillingshot,' said Scott, as\r\nhe took off his pads. 'You've got a knack of stopping them with your\r\nstomach, which the best first-class fields never have. You ought to\r\ngive lessons at it. Now we'll go and have some tea.'\r\n\r\nIf Pillingshot had had a more intimate acquaintance with the classics,\r\nhe would have observed at this point, '_Timeo Danaos_', and made a\r\nlast dash for liberty in the direction of the shop. But he was deceived\r\nby the specious nature of Scott's remark. Visions rose before his eyes\r\nof sitting back in one of Scott's armchairs, watching a fag toasting\r\nmuffins, which he would eventually dispatch with languid enjoyment. So\r\nhe followed Scott to his study. The classical parallel to his situation\r\nis the well-known case of the oysters. They, too, were eager for the\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the study, and Pillingshot was about to fling himself,\r\nwith a sigh of relief, into the most comfortable chair, when Scott\r\nunmasked his batteries.\r\n\r\n'Oh, by the way,' he said, with a coolness which to Pillingshot\r\nappeared simply brazen, 'I'm afraid my fag won't be here today. The\r\nyoung crock's gone and got mumps, or the plague, or something. So would\r\nyou mind just lighting that stove? It'll be rather warm, but that won't\r\nmatter. There are some muffins in the cupboard. You might weigh in with\r\nthem. You'll find the toasting-fork on the wall somewhere. It's hanging\r\nup. Got it? Good man. Fire away.'\r\n\r\nAnd Scott collected five cushions, two chairs, and a tin of mixed\r\nbiscuits, and made himself comfortable. Pillingshot, with feelings too\r\ndeep for words (in the then limited state of his vocabulary), did as he\r\nwas requested. There was something remarkable about the way Scott could\r\nalways get people to do things for him. He seemed to take everything\r\nfor granted. If he had had occasion to hire an assassin to make away\r\nwith the German Emperor, he would have said, 'Oh, I say, you might run\r\nover to Germany and kill the Kaiser, will you, there's a good chap?\r\nDon't be long.' And he would have taken a seat and waited, without the\r\nleast doubt in his mind that the thing would be carried through as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nPillingshot had just finished toasting the muffins, when the door\r\nopened, and Venables, of Merevale's, came in.\r\n\r\n'I thought I heard you say something about tea this afternoon, Scott,'\r\nsaid Venables. 'I just looked in on the chance. Good Heavens, man!\r\nFancy muffins at this time of year! Do you happen to know what the\r\nthermometer is in the shade?'\r\n\r\n'Take a seat,' said Scott. 'I attribute my entire success in life\r\nto the fact that I never find it too hot to eat muffins. Do you\r\nknow Pillingshot? One of the hottest fieldsmen in the School.\r\nAt least, he was just now. He's probably cooled off since then.\r\nVenables--Pillingshot, and _vice versa_. Buck up with the tea,\r\nPillingshot. What, ready? Good man. Now we might almost begin.'\r\n\r\n'Beastly thing that accident of young Brown's, wasn't it?' said Scott.\r\n'Chaps oughtn't to go slamming about like that with the field full of\r\nfellows. I suppose he won't be right by next Saturday?'\r\n\r\n'Not a chance. Why? Oh, yes, I forgot. He was to have scored for the\r\nteam at Windybury, wasn't he?'\r\n\r\n'Who are you going to get now?'\r\n\r\nVenables was captain of the St Austin's team. The match next Saturday\r\nwas at Windybury, on the latter's ground.\r\n\r\n'I haven't settled,' said Venables. 'But it's easy to get somebody.\r\nScoring isn't one of those things which only one chap in a hundred\r\nunderstands.'\r\n\r\nThen Pillingshot had an idea--a great, luminous idea.\r\n\r\n'May I score?' he asked, and waited trembling with apprehension lest\r\nthe request be refused.\r\n\r\n'All right,' said Venables, 'I don't see any reason why you shouldn't.\r\nWe have to catch the 8.14 at the station. Don't you go missing it or\r\nanything.'\r\n\r\n'Rather _not_,' said Pillingshot. 'Not much.'\r\n\r\n          *          *          *          *         *\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning, at exactly 9.15, Mr Mellish distributed the Livy\r\npapers. When he arrived at Pillingshot's seat and found it empty, an\r\nexpression passed over his face like unto that of the baffled villain\r\nin transpontine melodrama.\r\n\r\n'Where is Pillingshot?' he demanded tragically. 'Where is he?'\r\n\r\n'He's gone with the team to Windybury, sir,' said Parker, struggling to\r\nconceal a large size in grins. 'He's going to score.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Mr Mellish sadly to himself, 'he _has_ scored.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n\r\nTHE ODD TRICK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Philip St H. Harrison, of Merevale's House, towards his\r\nfellow-man was outwardly one of genial and even sympathetic toleration.\r\nDid his form-master intimate that his conduct was not _his_ idea\r\nof what Young England's conduct should be, P. St H. Harrison agreed\r\ncheerfully with every word he said, warmly approved his intention of\r\nlaying the matter before the Headmaster, and accepted his punishment\r\nwith the air of a waiter booking an order for a chump chop and fried\r\npotatoes. But the next day there would be a squeaking desk in the\r\nform-room, just to show the master that he had not been forgotten. Or,\r\nagain, did the captain of his side at football speak rudely to him on\r\nthe subject of kicking the ball through in the scrum, Harrison would\r\nsmile gently, and at the earliest opportunity tread heavily on the\r\ncaptain's toe. In short, he was a youth who made a practice of taking\r\nvery good care of himself. Yet he had his failures. The affair of\r\nGraham's mackintosh was one of them, and it affords an excellent\r\nexample of the truth of the proverb that a cobbler should stick to his\r\nlast. Harrison's _forte_ was diplomacy. When he forsook the arts\r\nof the diplomatist for those of the brigand, he naturally went wrong.\r\nAnd the manner of these things was thus.\r\n\r\nTony Graham was a prefect in Merevale's, and part of his duties was to\r\nlook after the dormitory of which Harrison was one of the ornaments. It\r\nwas a dormitory that required a good deal of keeping in order. Such\r\nchoice spirits as Braithwaite of the Upper Fourth, and Mace, who was\r\nrapidly driving the master of the Lower Fifth into a premature grave,\r\nneeded a firm hand. Indeed, they generally needed not only a firm hand,\r\nbut a firm hand grasping a serviceable walking-stick. Add to these\r\nHarrison himself, and others of a similar calibre, and it will be seen\r\nthat Graham's post was no sinecure. It was Harrison's custom to throw\r\noff his mask at night with his other garments, and appear in his true\r\ncharacter of an abandoned villain, willing to stick at nothing as long\r\nas he could do it strictly incog. In this capacity he had come into\r\nconstant contact with Graham. Even in the dark it is occasionally\r\npossible for a prefect to tell where a noise comes from. And if the\r\nsaid prefect has been harassed six days in the week by a noise, and\r\nlocates it suddenly on the seventh, it is wont to be bad for the\r\nproducer and patentee of same.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that Harrison, enjoying himself one night, after\r\nthe manner of his kind, was suddenly dropped upon with violence. He had\r\nconstructed an ingenious machine, consisting of a biscuit tin, some\r\npebbles, and some string. He put the pebbles in the tin, tied the\r\nstring to it, and placed it under a chest of drawers. Then he took the\r\nother end of the string to bed with him, and settled down to make a\r\nnight of it. At first all went well. Repeated inquiries from Tony\r\nfailed to produce the author of the disturbance, and when finally the\r\nquestions ceased, and the prefect appeared to have given the matter up\r\nas a bad job, P. St H. Harrison began to feel that under certain\r\ncircumstances life was worth living. It was while he was in this happy\r\nframe of mind that the string, with which he had just produced a\r\ntriumphant rattle from beneath the chest of drawers, was seized, and\r\nthe next instant its owner was enjoying the warmest minute of a\r\nchequered career. Tony, like Brer Rabbit, had laid low until he was\r\ncertain of the direction from which the sound proceeded. He had then\r\nslipped out of bed, crawled across the floor in a snake-like manner\r\nwhich would have done credit to a Red Indian, found the tin, and traced\r\nthe string to its owner. Harrison emerged from the encounter feeling\r\nsore and unfit for any further recreation. This deed of the night left\r\nits impression on Harrison. The account had to be squared somehow, and\r\nin a few days his chance came. Merevale's were playing a 'friendly'\r\nwith the School House, and in default of anybody better, Harrison had\r\nbeen pressed into service as umpire. This in itself had annoyed him.\r\nCricket was not in his line--he was not one of your flannelled\r\nfools--and of all things in connection with the game he loathed\r\numpiring most.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Tony came on to bowl at his end, _vice_ Charteris,\r\nwho had been hit for three fours in an over by Scott, the School\r\nslogger, he recognized that even umpiring had its advantages, and\r\nresolved to make the most of the situation.\r\n\r\nScott had the bowling, and he lashed out at Tony's first ball in his\r\nusual reckless style. There was an audible click, and what the sporting\r\npapers call confident appeals came simultaneously from Welch,\r\nMerevale's captain, who was keeping wicket, and Tony himself. Even\r\nScott seemed to know that his time had come. He moved a step or two\r\naway from the wicket, but stopped before going farther to look at the\r\numpire, on the off-chance of a miracle happening to turn his decision\r\nin the batsman's favour.\r\n\r\nThe miracle happened.\r\n\r\n'Not out,' said Harrison.\r\n\r\n'Awfully curious,' he added genially to Tony, 'how like a bat those\r\nbits of grass sound! You have to be jolly smart to know where a noise\r\ncomes from, don't you!'\r\n\r\nTony grunted disgustedly, and walked back again to the beginning of his\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nIf ever, in the whole history of cricket, a man was out\r\nleg-before-wicket, Scott was so out to Tony's second ball. It was\r\nhardly worth appealing for such a certainty. Still, the formality had\r\nto be gone through.\r\n\r\n'How was _that_?' inquired Tony.\r\n\r\n'Not out. It's an awful pity, don't you think, that they don't bring in\r\nthat new leg-before rule?'\r\n\r\n'Seems to me,' said Tony bitterly, 'the old rule holds pretty good when\r\na man's leg's bang in front.'\r\n\r\n'Rather. But you see the ball didn't pitch straight, and the rule\r\nsays--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' said Tony.\r\n\r\nThe next ball Scott hit for four, and the next after that for a couple.\r\nThe fifth was a yorker, and just grazed the leg stump. The sixth was a\r\nbeauty. You could see it was going to beat the batsman from the moment\r\nit left Tony's hand. Harrison saw it perfectly.\r\n\r\n'No ball,' he shouted. And just as he spoke Scott's off-stump\r\nricocheted towards the wicket-keeper.\r\n\r\n'Heavens, man,' said Tony, fairly roused out of his cricket manners, a\r\nvery unusual thing for him. 'I'll swear my foot never went over the\r\ncrease. Look, there's the mark.'\r\n\r\n'Rather not. Only, you see, it seemed to me you chucked that time. Of\r\ncourse, I know you didn't mean to, and all that sort of thing, but\r\nstill, the rules--'\r\n\r\nTony would probably have liked to have said something very forcible\r\nabout the rules at this point, but it occurred to him that after all\r\nHarrison was only within his rights, and that it was bad form to\r\ndispute the umpire's decision. Harrison walked off towards square-leg\r\nwith a holy joy.\r\n\r\nBut he was too much of an artist to overdo the thing. Tony's next over\r\npassed off without interference. Possibly, however, this was because it\r\nwas a very bad one. After the third over he asked Welch if he could get\r\nsomebody else to umpire, as he had work to do. Welch heaved a sigh of\r\nrelief, and agreed readily.\r\n\r\n'Conscientious sort of chap that umpire of yours,' said Scott to Tony,\r\nafter the match. Scott had made a hundred and four, and was feeling\r\npleased. 'Considering he's in your House, he's awfully fair.'\r\n\r\n'You mean that we generally swindle, I suppose?'\r\n\r\n'Of course not, you rotter. You know what I mean. But, I say, that\r\ncatch Welch and you appealed for must have been a near thing. I could\r\nhave sworn I hit it.'\r\n\r\n'Of course you did. It was clean out. So was the lbw. I say, did you\r\nthink that ball that bowled you was a chuck? That one in my first over,\r\nyou know.'\r\n\r\n'Chuck! My dear Tony, you don't mean to say that man pulled you up for\r\nchucking? I thought your foot must have gone over the crease.'\r\n\r\n'I believe the chap's mad,' said Tony.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps he's taking it out of you this way for treading on his corns\r\nsomehow. Have you been milling with this gentle youth lately?'\r\n\r\n'By Jove,' said Tony, 'you're right. I gave him beans only the other\r\nnight for ragging in the dormitory.'\r\n\r\nScott laughed.\r\n\r\n'Well, he seems to have been getting a bit of his own back today. Lucky\r\nthe game was only a friendly. Why will you let your angry passions\r\nrise, Tony? You've wrecked your analysis by it, though it's improved my\r\naverage considerably. I don't know if that's any solid satisfaction to\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'It isn't.'\r\n\r\n'You don't say so! Well, so long. If I were you, I should keep an eye\r\non that conscientious umpire.'\r\n\r\n'I will,' said Tony. 'Good-night.'\r\n\r\nThe process of keeping an eye on Harrison brought no results. When he\r\nwished to behave himself well, he could. On such occasions Sandford and\r\nMerton were literally not in it with him, and the hero of a\r\nSunday-school story would simply have refused to compete. But Nemesis,\r\nas the poets tell us, though no sprinter, manages, like the celebrated\r\nMaisie, to get right there in time. Give her time, and she will arrive.\r\nShe arrived in the case of Harrison. One morning, about a fortnight\r\nafter the House-match incident, Harrison awoke with a new sensation. At\r\nfirst he could not tell what exactly this sensation was, and being too\r\nsleepy to discuss nice points of internal emotion with himself, was\r\njust turning over with the intention of going to sleep again, when the\r\ntruth flashed upon him. The sensation he felt was loneliness, and the\r\nreason he felt lonely was because he was the only occupant of the\r\ndormitory. To right and left and all around were empty beds.\r\n\r\nAs he mused drowsily on these portents, the distant sound of a bell\r\ncame to his ears and completed the cure. It was the bell for chapel. He\r\ndragged his watch from under his pillow, and looked at it with\r\nconsternation. Four minutes to seven. And chapel was at seven. Now\r\nHarrison had been late for chapel before. It was not the thought of\r\nmissing the service that worried him. What really was serious was that\r\nhe had been late so many times before that Merevale had hinted at\r\nserious steps to be taken if he were late again, or, at any rate, until\r\na considerable interval of punctuality had elapsed.\r\n\r\nThat threat had been uttered only yesterday, and here he was in all\r\nprobability late once more.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to dress. He sprang out of bed, passed a sponge over\r\nhis face as a concession to the decencies, and looked round for\r\nsomething to cover his night-shirt, which, however suitable for\r\ndormitory use, was, he felt instinctively, scarcely the garment to wear\r\nin public.\r\n\r\nFate seemed to fight for him. On one of the pegs in the wall hung a\r\nmackintosh, a large, blessed mackintosh. He was inside it in a moment.\r\n\r\nFour minutes later he rushed into his place in chapel.\r\n\r\nThe short service gave him some time for recovering himself. He left\r\nthe building feeling a new man. His costume, though quaint, would not\r\ncall for comment. Chapel at St Austin's was never a full-dress\r\nceremony. Mackintoshes covering night-shirts were the rule rather than\r\nthe exception.\r\n\r\nBut between his costume and that of the rest there was this subtle\r\ndistinction. They wore their own mackintoshes. He wore somebody else's.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the School had split up into sections, each section making\r\nfor its own House, and Merevale's was already in sight, when Harrison\r\nfelt himself grasped from behind. He turned, to see Graham.\r\n\r\n'Might I ask,' enquired Tony with great politeness, 'who said you might\r\nwear my mackintosh?'\r\n\r\nHarrison gasped.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you didn't know it was mine?'\r\n\r\n'No, no, rather not. I didn't know.'\r\n\r\n'And if you had known it was mine, you wouldn't have taken it, I\r\nsuppose?'\r\n\r\n'Oh no, of course not,' said Harrison. Graham seemed to be taking an\r\nunexpectedly sensible view of the situation.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Tony, 'now that you know that it is mine, suppose you give\r\nit up.'\r\n\r\n'Give it up!'\r\n\r\n'Yes; buck up. It looks like rain, and I mustn't catch cold.'\r\n\r\n'But, Graham, I've only got on--'\r\n\r\n'Spare us these delicate details. Mack up, please, I want it.'\r\n\r\nFinally, Harrison appearing to be difficult in the matter, Tony took\r\nthe garment off for him, and went on his way.\r\n\r\nHarrison watched him go with mixed feelings. Righteous indignation\r\nstruggled with the gravest apprehension regarding his own future. If\r\nMerevale should see him! Horrible thought. He ran. He had just reached\r\nthe House, and was congratulating himself on having escaped, when the\r\nworst happened. At the private entrance stood Merevale, and with him\r\nthe Headmaster himself. They both eyed him with considerable interest\r\nas he shot in at the boys' entrance.\r\n\r\n'Harrison,' said Merevale after breakfast.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'The Headmaster wishes to see you--again.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' said Harrison.\r\n\r\nThere was a curious lack of enthusiasm in his voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n\r\nL'AFFAIRE UNCLE JOHN\r\n(_A Story in Letters_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFrom Richard Venables, of St Austin's School, to his brother Archibald\r\nVenables, of King's College, Cambridge:\r\n\r\nDear Archie--I take up my pen to write to you, not as one hoping for an\r\nanswer, but rather in order that (you notice the Thucydidean\r\nconstruction) I may tell you of an event the most important of those\r\nthat have gone before. You may or may not have heard far-off echoes of\r\nmy adventure with Uncle John, who has just come back from the\r\ndiamond-mines--and looks it. It happened thusly:\r\n\r\nLast Wednesday evening I was going through the cricket field to meet\r\nUncle John, at the station, as per esteemed favour from the governor,\r\ntelling me to. Just as I got on the scene, to my horror, amazement, and\r\ndisgust, I saw a middle-aged bounder, in loud checks, who, from his\r\nlooks, might have been anything from a retired pawnbroker to a\r\nsecond-hand butler, sacked from his last place for stealing the\r\nsherry, standing in the middle of the field, on the very wicket the\r\nRugborough match is to be played on next Saturday (tomorrow), and\r\ndigging--_digging_--I'll trouble you. Excavating great chunks of\r\nour best turf with a walking-stick. I was so unnerved, I nearly\r\nfainted. It's bad enough being captain of a School team under any\r\ncircs., as far as putting you off your game goes, but when you see the\r\nwicket you've been rolling by day, and dreaming about by night, being\r\nmangled by an utter stranger--well! They say a cow is slightly\r\nirritated when her calf is taken away from her, but I don't suppose the\r\nmost maternal cow that ever lived came anywhere near the frenzy that\r\nsurged up in my bosom at that moment. I flew up to him, foaming at the\r\nmouth. 'My dear sir,' I shrieked, '_are_ you aware that you're\r\nspoiling the best wicket that has ever been prepared since cricket\r\nbegan?' He looked at me, in a dazed sort of way, and said, 'What?' I\r\nsaid: 'How on earth do you think we're going to play Rugborough on a\r\nploughed field?' 'I don't follow, mister,' he replied. A man who calls\r\nyou 'mister' is beyond the pale. You are justified in being a little\r\nrude to him. So I said: 'Then you must be either drunk or mad, and I\r\ntrust it's the latter.' I believe that's from some book, though I don't\r\nremember which. This did seem to wake him up a bit, but before he could\r\nframe his opinion in words, up came Biffen, the ground-man, to have a\r\nlast look at his wicket before retiring for the night. When he saw the\r\nholes--they were about a foot deep, and scattered promiscuously, just\r\nwhere two balls out of three pitch--he almost had hysterics. I gently\r\nexplained the situation to him, and left him to settle with my friend\r\nof the check suit. Biffen was just settling down to a sort of Philippic\r\nwhen I went, and I knew that I had left the man in competent hands.\r\nThen I went to the station. The train I had been told to meet was the\r\n5.30. By the way, of course, I didn't know in the least what Uncle John\r\nwas like, not having seen him since I was about one-and-a-half, but I\r\nhad been told to look out for a tall, rather good-looking man. Well,\r\nthe 5.30 came in all right, but none of the passengers seemed to answer\r\nto the description. The ones who were tall were not good looking, and\r\nthe only man who was good looking stood five feet nothing in his boots.\r\nI did ask him if he was Mr John Dalgliesh; but, his name happening to\r\nbe Robinson, he could not oblige. I sat out a couple more trains, and\r\nthen went back to the field. The man had gone, but Biffen was still\r\nthere. 'Was you expecting anyone today, sir?' he asked, as I came up.\r\n'Yes. Why?' I said. 'That was 'im,' said Biffen. By skilful\r\nquestioning, I elicited the whole thing. It seems that the fearsome\r\nbargee, in checks, was the governor's 'tall, good-looking man'; in\r\nother words, Uncle John himself. He had come by the 4.30, I suppose.\r\nAnyway, there he was, and I had insulted him badly. Biffen told me that\r\nhe had asked who I was, and that he (Biffen) had given the information,\r\nwhile he was thinking of something else to say to him about his\r\ndigging. By the way, I suppose he dug from force of habit. Thought he'd\r\nfind diamonds, perhaps. When Biffen told him this, he said in a nasty\r\nvoice: 'Then, when he comes back will you have the goodness to tell him\r\nthat my name is John Dalgliesh, and that he will hear more of this.'\r\nAnd I'm uncommonly afraid I shall. The governor bars Uncle John\r\nawfully, I know, but he wanted me to be particularly civil to him,\r\nbecause he was to get me a place in some beastly firm when I leave. I\r\nhaven't heard from home yet, but I expect to soon. Still, I'd like to\r\nknow how I could stand and watch him ruining the wicket for our spot\r\nmatch of the season. As it is, it won't be as good as it would have\r\nbeen. The Rugborough slow man will be unplayable if he can find one of\r\nthese spots. Altogether, it's a beastly business. Write soon, though I\r\nknow you won't--Yours ever, _Dick_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTelegram from Major-General Sir Everard Venables, V.C., K.C.M.G., to\r\nhis son Richard Venables:\r\n\r\nVenables, St Austin's. What all this about Uncle John. Says were\r\ngrossly rude. Write explanation next post--_Venables_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nLetter from Mrs James Anthony (nee Miss Dorothy Venables) to her\r\nbrother Richard Venables:\r\n\r\nDear Dick--What _have_ you been doing to Uncle John? Jim and I are\r\nstopping for a fortnight with father, and have just come in for the\r\nwhole thing. Uncle John--_isn't_ he a horrible man?--says you were\r\ngrossly insolent to him when he went down to see you. _Do_ write\r\nand tell me all about it. I have heard no details as yet. Father\r\nrefuses to give them, and gets simply _furious_ when the matter is\r\nmentioned. Jim said at dinner last night that a conscientious boy would\r\nprobably feel bound to be rude to Uncle John. Father said 'Conscience\r\nbe--'; I forget the rest, but it was awful. Jim says if he gets any\r\nworse we shall have to sit on his head, and cut the traces. He is\r\ngetting so dreadfully _horsey_. Do write the very minute you get\r\nthis. I want to know all about it.--Your affectionate sister, _Dorothy_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPart of Letter from Richard Venables, of St Austin's, to his father\r\nMajor-General Sir Everard Venables, V.C., K.C.M.G.:\r\n\r\n... So you see it was really his fault. The Emperor of Germany has no\r\nright to come and dig holes in our best wicket. Take a parallel case.\r\nSuppose some idiot of a fellow (not that Uncle John's that, of course,\r\nbut you know what I mean) came and began rooting up your azaleas.\r\nWouldn't you want to say something cutting? I will apologize to Uncle\r\nJohn, if you like; but still, I do think he might have gone somewhere\r\nelse if he really wanted to dig. So you see, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nLetter from Richard Venables, of St Austin's, to his sister Mrs James\r\nAnthony:\r\n\r\nDear Dolly--Thanks awfully for your letter, and thank Jim for his\r\nmessage. He's a ripper. I'm awfully glad you married him and not that\r\nrotter, Thompson, who used to hang on so. I hope the most marvellous\r\ninfant on earth is flourishing. And now about Uncle John. Really, I am\r\njolly glad I did say all that to him. We played Rugborough yesterday,\r\nand the wicket was simply vile. They won the toss, and made two hundred\r\nand ten. Of course, the wicket was all right at one end, and that's\r\nwhere they made most of their runs. I was wicket-keeping as usual, and\r\nI felt awfully ashamed of the beastly pitch when their captain asked me\r\nif it was the football-field. Of course, he wouldn't have said that if\r\nhe hadn't been a pal of mine, but it was probably what the rest of the\r\nteam thought, only they were too polite to say so. When we came to bat\r\nit was worse than ever. I went in first with Welch--that's the fellow\r\nwho stopped a week at home a few years ago; I don't know whether you\r\nremember him. He got out in the first over, caught off a ball that\r\npitched where Uncle John had been prospecting, and jumped up. It was\r\nrotten luck, of course, and worse was to follow, for by half-past five\r\nwe had eight wickets down for just over the hundred, and only young\r\nScott, who's simply a slogger, and another fellow to come in. Well,\r\nScott came in. I had made about sixty then, and was fairly well\r\nset--and he started simply mopping up the bowling. He gave a chance\r\nevery over as regular as clockwork, and it was always missed, and then\r\nhe would make up for it with two or three tremendous whangs--a safe\r\nfour every time. It wasn't batting. It was more like golf. Well, this\r\nwent on for some time, and we began to get hopeful again, having got a\r\nhundred and eighty odd. I just kept up my wicket, while Scott hit. Then\r\nhe got caught, and the last man, a fellow called Moore, came in. I'd\r\nput him in the team as a bowler, but he could bat a little, too, on\r\noccasions, and luckily this was one of them. There were only eleven to\r\nwin, and I had the bowling. I was feeling awfully fit, and put their\r\nslow man clean over the screen twice running, which left us only three\r\nto get. Then it was over, and Moore played the fast man in grand style,\r\nthough he didn't score. Well, I got the bowling again, and half-way\r\nthrough the over I carted a half-volley into the Pav., and that gave us\r\nthe match. Moore hung on for a bit and made about ten, and then got\r\nbowled. We made 223 altogether, of which I had managed to get\r\nseventy-eight, not out. It pulls my average up a good bit. Rather\r\ndecent, isn't it? The fellows rotted about a good deal, and chaired me\r\ninto the Pav., but it was Scott who won us the match, I think. He made\r\nninety-four. But Uncle John nearly did for us with his beastly\r\nwalking-stick. On a good wicket we might have made any number. I don't\r\nknow how the affair will end. Keep me posted up in the governor's\r\nsymptoms, and write again soon.--Your affectionate brother, _Dick_\r\n\r\nPS.--On looking over this letter, I find I have taken it for granted\r\nthat you know all about the Uncle John affair. Probably you do, but, in\r\ncase you don't, it was this way. You see, I was going, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nFrom Archibald Venables, of King's College, Cambridge, to Richard\r\nVenables, of St Austin's:\r\n\r\nDear Dick--Just a line to thank you for your letter, and to tell you\r\nthat since I got it I have had a visit from the great Uncle John, too.\r\nHe _is_ an outsider, if you like. I gave him the best lunch I\r\ncould in my rooms, and the man started a long lecture on extravagance.\r\nHe doesn't seem to understand the difference between the 'Varsity and a\r\nprivate school. He kept on asking leading questions about pocket-money\r\nand holidays, and wanted to know if my master allowed me to walk in the\r\nstreets in that waistcoat--a remark which cut me to the quick, 'that\r\nwaistcoat' being quite the most posh thing of the sort in Cambridge. He\r\nthen enquired after my studies; and, finally, when I saw him off at the\r\nstation, said that he had decided not to tip me, because he was afraid\r\nthat I was inclined to be extravagant. I was quite kind to him,\r\nhowever, in spite of everything; but I was glad you had spoken to him\r\nlike a father. The recollection of it soothed me, though it seemed to\r\nworry him. He talked a good deal about it. Glad you came off against\r\nRugborough.--Yours ever, _A. Venables_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nFrom Mr John Dalgliesh to Mr Philip Mortimer, of Penge:\r\n\r\nDear Sir--In reply to your letter of the 18th inst., I shall be happy\r\nto recommend your son, Reginald, for the vacant post in the firm of\r\nMessrs Van Nugget, Diomonde, and Mynes, African merchants. I have\r\nwritten them to that effect, and you will, doubtless, receive a\r\ncommunication from them shortly.--I am, my dear sir, yours faithfully,\r\n_J. Dalgliesh_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nFrom Richard Venables, of St Austin's, to his father Major-General Sir\r\nEverard Venables, V.C., K.C.M.G.:\r\n\r\nDear Father--Uncle John writes, in answer to my apology, to say that no\r\napologies will meet the case; and that he has given his nomination in\r\nthat rotten City firm of his to a fellow called Mortimer. But rather a\r\ndecent thing has happened. There is a chap here I know pretty well, who\r\nis the son of Lord Marmaduke Twistleton, and it appears that the dook\r\nhimself was down watching the Rugborough match, and liked my batting.\r\nHe came and talked to me after the match, and asked me what I was going\r\nto do when I left, and I said I wasn't certain, and he said that, if I\r\nhadn't anything better on, he could give me a place on his estate up in\r\nScotland, as a sort of land-agent, as he wanted a chap who could play\r\ncricket, because he was keen on the game himself, and always had a lot\r\ngoing on in the summer up there. So he says that, if I go up to the\r\n'Varsity for three years, he can guarantee me the place when I come\r\ndown, with a jolly good screw and a ripping open-air life, with lots of\r\nriding, and so on, which is just what I've always wanted. So, can I?\r\nIt's the sort of opportunity that won't occur again, and you know you\r\nalways said the only reason I couldn't go up to the 'Varsity was, that\r\nit would be a waste of time. But in this case, you see, it won't,\r\nbecause he wants me to go, and guarantees me the place when I come\r\ndown. It'll be awfully fine, if I may. I hope you'll see it.--Your\r\naffectionate son, _Dick_\r\n\r\nPS.--I think he's writing to you. He asked your address. I think Uncle\r\nJohn's a rotter. I sent him a rattling fine apology, and this is how he\r\ntreats it. But it'll be all right if you like this land-agent idea. If\r\nyou like, you might wire your answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTelegram from Major-General Sir Everard Venables, V.C., K.C.M.G., to\r\nhis son Richard Venables, of St Austin's:\r\n\r\nVenables, St Austin's. Very well.--_Venables_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nExtract from Letter from Richard Venables, of St Austin's, to his\r\nfather Major-General Sir Everard Venables, V.C., K.C.M.G.:\r\n\r\n... Thanks, awfully--\r\n\r\nExtract from _The Austinian_ of October:\r\n\r\nThe following O.A.s have gone into residence this year: At Oxford, J.\r\nScrymgeour, Corpus Christi; R. Venables, Trinity; K. Crespigny-Brown,\r\nBalliol.\r\n\r\nExtract from the _Daily Mail_'s account of the 'Varsity match of\r\nthe following summer:\r\n\r\n... The St Austin's freshman, Venables, fully justified his inclusion by\r\nscoring a stylish fifty-seven. He hit eight fours, and except for a\r\nmiss-hit in the slips, at 51, which Smith might possibly have secured\r\nhad he started sooner, gave nothing like a chance. Venables, it will be\r\nremembered, played several good innings for Oxford in the earlier\r\nmatches, notably, his not out contribution of 103 against Sussex--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\nHARRISON'S SLIGHT ERROR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one o'clock down express was just on the point of starting. The\r\nengine-driver, with his hand on the lever, whiled away the moments,\r\nlike the watchman in _The Agamemnon_, by whistling. The guard\r\nendeavoured to talk to three people at once. Porters flitted to and\r\nfro, cleaving a path for themselves with trucks of luggage. The Usual\r\nOld Lady was asking if she was right for some place nobody had ever\r\nheard of. Everybody was saying good-bye to everybody else, and last,\r\nbut not least, P. St H. Harrison, of St Austin's, was strolling at a\r\nleisurely pace towards the rear of the train. There was no need for him\r\nto hurry. For had not his friend, Mace, promised to keep a corner-seat\r\nfor him while he went to the refreshment-room to lay in supplies?\r\nUndoubtedly he had, and Harrison, as he watched the struggling crowd,\r\ncongratulated himself that he was not as other men. A corner seat in a\r\ncarriage full of his own particular friends, with plenty of provisions,\r\nand something to read in case he got tired of talking--it would be\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was he in these reflections, that he did not notice that\r\nfrom the opposite end of the platform a youth of about his own age was\r\nalso making for the compartment in question. The first intimation he\r\nhad of his presence was when the latter, arriving first at the door by\r\na short head, hurled a bag on to the rack, and sank gracefully into the\r\nidentical corner seat which Harrison had long regarded as his own\r\npersonal property. And to make matters worse, there was no other vacant\r\nseat in the compartment. Harrison was about to protest, when the guard\r\nblew his whistle. There was nothing for it but to jump in and argue the\r\nmatter out _en route_. Harrison jumped in, to be greeted instantly\r\nby a chorus of nine male voices. 'Outside there! No room! Turn him\r\nout!' said the chorus. Then the chorus broke up into its component\r\nparts, and began to address him one by one.\r\n\r\n'You rotter, Harrison,' said Babington, of Dacre's, 'what do you come\r\nbarging in here for? Can't you see we're five aside already?'\r\n\r\n'Hope you've brought a sardine-opener with you, old chap,' said\r\nBarrett, the peerless pride of Philpott's, ''cos we shall jolly well\r\nneed one when we get to the good old Junct-i-on. Get up into the rack,\r\nHarrison, you're stopping the ventilation.'\r\n\r\nThe youth who had commandeered Harrison's seat so neatly took another\r\nunpardonable liberty at this point. He grinned. Not the timid,\r\ndeprecating smile of one who wishes to ingratiate himself with\r\nstrangers, but a good, six-inch grin right across his face. Harrison\r\nturned on him savagely.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said, 'just you get out of that. What do you mean by\r\nbagging my seat?'\r\n\r\n'Are you a director of this line?' enquired the youth politely. Roars\r\nof applause from the interested audience. Harrison began to feel hot\r\nand uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n'Or only the Emperor of Germany?' pursued his antagonist.\r\n\r\nMore applause, during which Harrison dropped his bag of provisions,\r\nwhich were instantly seized and divided on the share and share alike\r\nsystem, among the gratified Austinians.\r\n\r\n'Look here, none of your cheek,' was the shockingly feeble retort which\r\nalone occurred to him. The other said nothing. Harrison returned to the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said, 'are you going to get out, or have I got to make\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\nNot a word did his opponent utter. To quote the bard: 'The stripling\r\nsmiled.' To tell the truth, the stripling smiled inanely.\r\n\r\nThe other occupants of the carriage were far from imitating his\r\nreserve. These treacherous friends, realizing that, for those who were\r\nthemselves comfortably seated, the spectacle of Harrison standing up\r\nwith aching limbs for a journey of some thirty miles would be both\r\ngrateful and comforting, espoused the cause of the unknown with all the\r\nvigour of which they were capable.\r\n\r\n'Beastly bully, Harrison,' said Barrett. 'Trying to turn the kid out of\r\nhis seat! Why can't you leave the chap alone? Don't you move, kid.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said the unknown, 'I wasn't going to.'\r\n\r\n'Now you see what comes of slacking,' said Grey. 'If you'd bucked up\r\nand got here in time you might have bagged this seat I've got. By Jove,\r\nHarrison, you've no idea how comfortable it is in this corner.'\r\n\r\n'Punctuality,' said Babington, 'is the politeness of princes.'\r\n\r\nAnd again the unknown maddened Harrison with a 'best-on-record' grin.\r\n\r\n'But, I say, you chaps,' said he, determined as a last resource to\r\nappeal to their better feelings (if any), 'Mace was keeping this seat\r\nfor me, while I went to get some grub. Weren't you, Mace?' He turned to\r\nMace for corroboration. To his surprise, Mace was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nHis sympathetic school-fellows grasped the full humour of the situation\r\nas one man, and gave tongue once more in chorus.\r\n\r\n'You weed,' they yelled joyfully, 'you've got into the wrong carriage.\r\nMace is next door.'\r\n\r\nAnd then, with the sound of unquenchable laughter ringing in his ears,\r\nHarrison gave the thing up, and relapsed into a disgusted silence. No\r\nsingle word did he speak until the journey was done, and the carriage\r\nemptied itself of its occupants at the Junction. The local train was in\r\nreadiness to take them on to St Austin's, and this time Harrison\r\nmanaged to find a seat without much difficulty. But it was a bitter\r\nmoment when Mace, meeting him on the platform, addressed him as a\r\nrotter, for that he had not come to claim the corner seat which he had\r\nbeen reserving for him. They had had, said Mace, a rattling good time\r\ncoming down. What sort of a time had Harrison had in _his_\r\ncarriage? Harrison's reply was not remarkable for its clearness.\r\n\r\nThe unknown had also entered the local train. It was plain, therefore,\r\nthat he was coming to the School as a new boy. Harrison began to wonder\r\nif, under these circumstances, something might not be done in the\r\nmatter by way of levelling up things. He pondered. When St Austin's\r\nstation was reached, and the travellers began to stream up the road\r\ntowards the College, he discovered that the newcomer was a member of\r\nhis own House. He was standing close beside him, and heard Babington\r\nexplaining to him the way to Merevale's. Merevale was Harrison's\r\nHouse-master.\r\n\r\nIt was two minutes after he had found out this fact that the Grand Idea\r\ncame to Harrison. He saw his way now to a revenge so artistic, so\r\nbeautifully simple, that it was with some difficulty that he restrained\r\nhimself from bursting into song. For two pins, he felt, he could have\r\ndone a cake-walk.\r\n\r\nHe checked his emotion. He beat it steadily back, and quenched it. When\r\nhe arrived at Merevale's, he went first to the matron's room. 'Has\r\nVenables come back yet?' he asked.\r\n\r\nVenables was the head of Merevale's House, captain of the School\r\ncricket, wing three-quarter of the School Fifteen, and a great man\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the matron, 'he came back early this afternoon.'\r\n\r\nHarrison knew it. Venables always came back early on the last day of\r\nthe holidays.\r\n\r\n'He was upstairs a short while ago,' continued the matron. 'He was\r\nputting his study tidy.'\r\n\r\nHarrison knew it. Venables always put his study tidy on the last day of\r\nthe holidays. He took a keen and perfectly justifiable pride in his\r\nstudy, which was the most luxurious in the House.\r\n\r\n'Is he there now?' asked Harrison.\r\n\r\n'No. He has gone over to see the Headmaster.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said Harrison, 'it doesn't matter. It wasn't anything\r\nimportant.'\r\n\r\nHe retired triumphant. Things were going excellently well for his\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nHis next act was to go to the fags' room, where, as he had expected, he\r\nfound his friend of the train. Luck continued to be with him. The\r\nunknown was alone.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' said Harrison.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' said the fellow-traveller. He had resolved to follow\r\nHarrison's lead. If Harrison was bringing war, then war let it be. If,\r\nhowever, his intentions were friendly, he would be friendly too.\r\n\r\n'I didn't know you were coming to Merevale's. It's the best House in\r\nthe School.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, for one thing, everybody except the kids has a study.'\r\n\r\n'What? Not really? Why, I thought we had to keep to this room. One of\r\nthe chaps told me so.'\r\n\r\n'Trying to green you, probably. You must look out for that sort of\r\nthing. I'll show you the way to your study, if you like. Come along\r\nupstairs.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks, awfully. It's awfully good of you,' said the gratified\r\nunknown, and they went upstairs together.\r\n\r\nOne of the doors which they passed on their way was open, disclosing to\r\nview a room which, though bare at present, looked as if it might be\r\nmade exceedingly comfortable.\r\n\r\n'That's my den,' said Harrison. It was perhaps lucky that Graham, to\r\nwhom the room belonged, in fact, as opposed to fiction, did not hear\r\nthe remark. Graham and Harrison were old and tried foes. 'This is\r\nyours.' Harrison pushed open another door at the end of the passage.\r\n\r\nHis companion stared blankly at the Oriental luxury which met his eye.\r\n'But, I say,' he said, 'are you sure? This seems to be occupied\r\nalready.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, that's all right,' said Harrison, airily. 'The chap who used\r\nto be here left last term. He didn't know he was going to leave till it\r\nwas too late to pack up all his things, so he left his study as it was.\r\nAll you've got to do is to cart the things out into the passage and\r\nleave them there. The Moke'll take 'em away.'\r\n\r\nThe Moke was the official who combined in a single body the duties of\r\nbutler and bootboy at Merevale's House. 'Oh, right-ho!' said the\r\nunknown, and Harrison left him.\r\n\r\nHarrison's idea was that when Venables returned and found an absolute\r\nstranger placidly engaged in wrecking his carefully-tidied study, he\r\nwould at once, and without making inquiries, fall upon that absolute\r\nstranger and blot him off the face of the earth. Afterwards it might\r\npossibly come out that he, Harrison, had been not altogether\r\nunconnected with the business, and then, he was fain to admit, there\r\nmight be trouble. But he was a youth who never took overmuch heed for\r\nthe morrow. Sufficient unto the day was his motto. And, besides, it was\r\ndistinctly worth risking. The main point, and the one with which alone\r\nthe House would concern itself, was that he had completely taken in,\r\nscored off, and overwhelmed the youth who had done as much by him in\r\nthe train, and his reputation as one not to be lightly trifled with\r\nwould be restored to its former brilliance. Anything that might happen\r\nbetween himself and Venables subsequently would be regarded as a purely\r\nprivate matter between man and man, affecting the main point not at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later a small Merevalian informed Harrison that Venables\r\nwished to see him in his study. He went. Experience had taught him that\r\nwhen the Head of the House sent for him, it was as a rule as well to\r\nhumour his whim and go. He was prepared for a good deal, for he had\r\ncome to the conclusion that it was impossible for him to preserve his\r\nincognito in the matter, but he was certainly not prepared for what he\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nVenables and the stranger were seated in two armchairs, apparently on\r\nthe very best of terms with one another. And this, in spite of the fact\r\nthat these two armchairs were the only furniture left in the study. The\r\nrest, as he had noted with a grin before he had knocked at the door,\r\nwas picturesquely scattered about the passage.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Harrison,' said Venables, 'I wanted to see you. There seems to\r\nhave been a slight mistake somewhere. Did you tell my brother to shift\r\nall the furniture out of the study?'\r\n\r\nHarrison turned a delicate shade of green.\r\n\r\n'Your--er--brother?' he gurgled.\r\n\r\n'Yes. I ought to have told you my brother was coming to the Coll. this\r\nterm. I told the Old Man and Merevale and the rest of the authorities.\r\nCan't make out why I forgot you. Slipped my mind somehow. However, you\r\nseem to have been doing the square thing by him, showing him round and\r\nso on. Very good of you.'\r\n\r\nHarrison smiled feebly. Venables junior grinned. What seemed to\r\nHarrison a mystery was how the brothers had managed to arrive at the\r\nSchool at different times. The explanation of which was in reality very\r\nsimple. The elder Venables had been spending the last week of the\r\nholidays with MacArthur, the captain of the St Austin's Fifteen, the\r\nsame being a day boy, suspended within a mile of the School.\r\n\r\n'But what I can't make out,' went on Venables, relentlessly, 'is this\r\nfurniture business. To the best of my knowledge I didn't leave suddenly\r\nat the end of last term. I'll ask if you like, to make sure, but I\r\nfancy you'll find you've been mistaken. Must have been thinking of\r\nsomeone else. Anyhow, we thought you must know best, so we lugged all\r\nthe furniture out into the passage, and now it appears there's been a\r\nmistake of sorts, and the stuff ought to be inside all the time. So\r\nwould you mind putting it back again? We'd help you, only we're going\r\nout to the shop to get some tea. You might have it done by the time we\r\nget back. Thanks, awfully.'\r\n\r\nHarrison coughed nervously, and rose to a point of order.\r\n\r\n'I was going out to tea, too,' he said.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry, but I think you'll have to scratch the engagement,' said\r\nVenables.\r\n\r\nHarrison made a last effort.\r\n\r\n'I'm fagging for Welch this term,' he protested.\r\n\r\nIt was the rule at St Austin's that every fag had the right to refuse\r\nto serve two masters. Otherwise there would have been no peace for that\r\ndown-trodden race.\r\n\r\n'That,' said Venables, 'ought to be awfully jolly for Welch, don't you\r\nknow, but as a matter of fact term hasn't begun yet. It doesn't start\r\ntill tomorrow. Weigh in.'\r\n\r\nVarious feelings began to wage war beneath Harrison's Eton waistcoat. A\r\nprofound disinclination to undertake the suggested task battled briskly\r\nwith a feeling that, if he refused the commission, things might--nay,\r\nwould--happen.\r\n\r\n'Harrison,' said Venables gently, but with meaning, as he hesitated,\r\n'do you know what it is to wish you had never been born?'\r\n\r\nAnd Harrison, with a thoughtful expression on his face, picked up a\r\nphotograph from the floor, and hung it neatly in its place over the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5]\r\n\r\nBRADSHAW'S LITTLE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe qualities which in later years rendered Frederick Wackerbath\r\nBradshaw so conspicuous a figure in connection with the now celebrated\r\naffair of the European, African, and Asiatic Pork Pie and Ham Sandwich\r\nSupply Company frauds, were sufficiently in evidence during his school\r\ncareer to make his masters prophesy gloomily concerning his future. The\r\nboy was in every detail the father of the man. There was the same\r\ngenial unscrupulousness, upon which the judge commented so bitterly\r\nduring the trial, the same readiness to seize an opportunity and make\r\nthe most of it, the same brilliance of tactics. Only once during those\r\nyears can I remember an occasion on which Justice scored a point\r\nagainst him. I can remember it, because I was in a sense responsible\r\nfor his failure. And he can remember it, I should be inclined to think,\r\nfor other reasons. Our then Headmaster was a man with a straight eye\r\nand a good deal of muscular energy, and it is probable that the\r\ntalented Frederick, in spite of the passage of years, has a tender\r\nrecollection of these facts.\r\n\r\nIt was the eve of the Euripides examination in the Upper Fourth.\r\nEuripides is not difficult compared to some other authors, but he does\r\ndemand a certain amount of preparation. Bradshaw was a youth who did\r\nless preparation than anybody I have ever seen, heard of, or read of,\r\npartly because he preferred to peruse a novel under the table during\r\nprep., but chiefly, I think, because he had reduced cribbing in form to\r\nsuch an exact science that he loved it for its own sake, and would no\r\nsooner have come tamely into school with a prepared lesson than a\r\nsportsman would shoot a sitting bird. It was not the marks that he\r\ncared for. He despised them. What he enjoyed was the refined pleasure\r\nof swindling under a master's very eye. At the trial the judge, who\r\nhad, so ran report, been himself rather badly bitten by the Ham\r\nSandwich Company, put the case briefly and neatly in the words, 'You\r\nappear to revel in villainy for villainy's sake,' and I am almost\r\ncertain that I saw the beginnings of a gratified smile on Frederick's\r\nexpressive face as he heard the remark. The rest of our study--the\r\njuniors at St Austin's pigged in quartettes--were in a state of\r\nconsiderable mental activity on account of this Euripides examination.\r\nThere had been House-matches during the preceding fortnight, and\r\nHouse-matches are not a help to study, especially if you are on the\r\nvery fringe of the cock-house team, as I was. By dint of practising\r\nevery minute of spare time, I had got the eleventh place for my\r\nfielding. And, better still, I had caught two catches in the second\r\ninnings, one of them a regular gallery affair, and both off the\r\ncaptain's bowling. It was magnificent, but it was not Euripides, and I\r\nwished now that it had been. Mellish, our form-master, had an\r\nunpleasant habit of coming down with both feet, as it were, on members\r\nof his form who failed in the book-papers.\r\n\r\nWe were working, therefore, under forced draught, and it was distinctly\r\nannoying to see the wretched Bradshaw lounging in our only armchair\r\nwith one of Rider Haggard's best, seemingly quite unmoved at the\r\nprospect of Euripides examinations. For all he appeared to care,\r\nEuripides might never have written a line in his life.\r\n\r\nKendal voiced the opinion of the meeting.\r\n\r\n'Bradshaw, you worm,' he said. 'Aren't you going to do _any_\r\nwork?'\r\n\r\n'Think not. What's the good? Can't get up a whole play of Euripides in\r\ntwo hours.'\r\n\r\n'Mellish'll give you beans.'\r\n\r\n'Let him.'\r\n\r\n'You'll get a jolly bad report.'\r\n\r\n'Shan't get a report at all. I always intercept it before my guardian\r\ncan get it. He never says anything.'\r\n\r\n'Mellish'll probably run you in to the Old Man,' said White, the fourth\r\noccupant of the study.\r\n\r\nBradshaw turned on us with a wearied air.\r\n\r\n'Oh, do give us a rest,' he said. 'Here you are just going to do a most\r\nimportant exam., and you sit jawing away as if you were paid for it.\r\nOh, I say, by the way, who's setting the paper tomorrow?'\r\n\r\n'Mellish, of course,' said White.\r\n\r\n'No, he isn't,' I said. 'Shows what a lot you know about it. Mellish is\r\nsetting the Livy paper.'\r\n\r\n'Then, who's doing this one?' asked Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n'Yorke.'\r\n\r\nYorke was the master of the Upper Fifth. He generally set one of the\r\nupper fourth book-papers.\r\n\r\n'Certain?' said Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n'Absolutely.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks. That's all I wanted to know. By Jove, I advise you chaps to\r\nread this. It's grand. Shall I read out this bit about a fight?'\r\n\r\n'No!' we shouted virtuously, all together, though we were dying to hear\r\nit, and we turned once more to the loathsome inanities of the second\r\nchorus. If we had been doing Homer, we should have felt more in touch\r\nwith Bradshaw. There's a good deal of similarity, when you come to\r\ncompare them, between Homer and Haggard. They both deal largely in\r\nbloodshed, for instance. As events proved, the Euripides paper, like\r\nmany things which seem formidable at a distance, was not nearly so bad\r\nas I had expected. I did a fair-to-moderate paper, and Kendal and White\r\nboth seemed satisfied with themselves. Bradshaw confessed without\r\nemotion that he had only attempted the last half of the last question,\r\nand on being pressed for further information, merely laughed\r\nmysteriously, and said vaguely that it would be all right.\r\n\r\nIt now became plain that he had something up his sleeve. We expressed a\r\nunanimous desire to know what it was.\r\n\r\n'You might tell a chap,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Out with it, Bradshaw, or we'll lynch you,' added Kendal.\r\n\r\nBradshaw, however, was not to be drawn. Much of his success in the\r\npaths of crime, both at school and afterwards, was due to his secretive\r\nhabits. He never permitted accomplices.\r\n\r\nOn the following Wednesday the marks were read out. Out of a possible\r\nhundred I had obtained sixty--which pleased me very much indeed--White,\r\nfifty-five, Kendal, sixty-one. The unspeakable Bradshaw's net total was\r\nfour.\r\n\r\nMellish always read out bad marks in a hushed voice, expressive of\r\ndisgust and horror, but four per cent was too much for him. He shouted\r\nit, and the form yelled applause, until Ponsonby came in from the Upper\r\nFifth next door with Mr Yorke's compliments, 'and would we recollect\r\nthat his form were trying to do an examination'.\r\n\r\nWhen order had been restored, Mellish settled his glasses and glared\r\nthrough them at Bradshaw, who, it may be remarked, had not turned a\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n'Bradshaw,' he said, 'how do you explain this?'\r\n\r\nIt was merely a sighting shot, so to speak. Nobody was ever expected to\r\nanswer the question. Bradshaw, however, proved himself the exception to\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\n'I can explain, sir,' he said, 'if I may speak to you privately\r\nafterwards.'\r\n\r\nI have seldom seen anyone so astonished as Mellish was at these words.\r\nIn the whole course of his professional experience, he had never met\r\nwith a parallel case. It was hard on the poor man not to be allowed to\r\nspeak his mind about a matter of four per cent in a book-paper, but\r\nwhat could he do? He could not proceed with his denunciation, for if\r\nBradshaw's explanation turned out a sufficient excuse, he would have to\r\nwithdraw it all again, and vast stores of golden eloquence would be\r\nwasted. But, then, if he bottled up what he wished to say altogether,\r\nit might do him a serious internal injury. At last he hit on a\r\ncompromise. He said, 'Very well, Bradshaw, I will hear what you have to\r\nsay,' and then sprang, like the cat in the poem, 'all claws', upon an\r\nunfortunate individual who had scored twenty-nine, and who had been\r\ncongratulating himself that Bradshaw's failings would act as a sort of\r\nlightning-conductor to him. Bradshaw worked off his explanation in\r\nunder five minutes. I tried to stay behind to listen, on the pretext of\r\nwanting to tidy up my desk, but was ejected by request. Bradshaw\r\nexplained that his statement was private.\r\n\r\nAfter a time they came out together like long-lost brothers, Mellish\r\nwith his hand on Bradshaw's shoulder. It was some small comfort to me\r\nto remember that Bradshaw had the greatest dislike to this sort of\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Bradshaw, able exponent of the art of fiction that\r\nhe was, must have excelled himself on this occasion. I tried to get the\r\nstory out of him in the study that evening. White and Kendal assisted.\r\nWe tried persuasion first. That having failed, we tried taunts. Then we\r\ntried kindness. Kendal sat on his legs, and I sat on his head, and\r\nWhite twisted his arm. I think that we should have extracted something\r\nsoon, either his arm from its socket or a full confession, but we were\r\ninterrupted. The door flew open, and Prater (the same being our\r\nHouse-master, and rather a good sort) appeared.\r\n\r\n'Now then, now then,' he said. Prater's manner is always abrupt.\r\n\r\n'What's this? I can't have this. I can't have this. Get up at once.\r\nWhere's Bradshaw?'\r\n\r\nI rose gracefully to my feet, thereby disclosing the classic features\r\nof the lost one.\r\n\r\n'The Headmaster wants to see you at once, Bradshaw, at the School\r\nHouse. You others had better find something to do, or you will be\r\ngetting into trouble.'\r\n\r\nHe and Bradshaw left together, while we speculated on the cause of the\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\nWe were not left very long in suspense. In a quarter of an hour\r\nBradshaw returned, walking painfully, and bearing what, to the expert's\r\neye, are the unmistakable signs of a 'touching up', which, being\r\ninterpreted, is corporal punishment.\r\n\r\n'Hullo,' said White, as he appeared, 'what's all this?'\r\n\r\n'How many?' enquired the statistically-minded Kendal. 'You'll be\r\nthankful for this when you're a man, Bradshaw.'\r\n\r\n'That's what I always say to myself when I'm touched up,' added Kendal.\r\n\r\nI said nothing, but it was to me that the wounded one addressed\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n'You utter ass,' he said, in tones of concentrated venom.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Bradshaw--' I began, protestingly.\r\n\r\n'It's all through you--you idiot,' he snarled. 'I got twelve.'\r\n\r\n'Twelve isn't so dusty,' said White, critically. 'Most I ever got was\r\nsix.'\r\n\r\n'But why was it?' asked Kendal. 'That's what we want to know. What have\r\nyou been and gone and done?'\r\n\r\n'It's about that Euripides paper,' said Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Kendal.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I don't mind telling you about it now. When Mellish had me up\r\nafter school today, I'd got my yarn all ready. There wasn't a flaw in\r\nit anywhere as far as I could see. My idea was this. I told him I'd\r\nbeen to Yorke's room the day before the exam, to ask him if he had any\r\nmarks for us. That was all right. Yorke was doing the two Unseen\r\npapers, and it was just the sort of thing a fellow would do to go and\r\nask him about the marks.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'Then when I got there he was out, and I looked about for the marks,\r\nand on the table I saw the Euripides paper.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' said Kendal. We began to understand, and to realize that\r\nhere was a master-mind.\r\n\r\n'Well, of course, I read it, not knowing what it was, and then, as the\r\nonly way of not taking an unfair advantage, I did as badly as I could\r\nin the exam. That was what I told Mellish. Any beak would have\r\nswallowed it.'\r\n\r\n'Well, didn't he?'\r\n\r\n'Mellish did all right, but the rotter couldn't keep it to himself.\r\nWent and told the Old Man. The Old Man sent for me. He was as decent as\r\nanything at first. That was just his guile. He made me describe exactly\r\nwhere I had seen the paper, and so on. That was rather risky, of\r\ncourse, but I put it as vaguely as I could. When I had finished, he\r\nsuddenly whipped round, and said, \"Bradshaw, why are you telling me all\r\nthese lies?\" That's the sort of thing that makes you feel rather a\r\nwreck. I was too surprised to say anything.'\r\n\r\n'I can guess the rest,' said Kendal. 'But how on earth did he know it\r\nwas all lies? Why didn't you stick to your yarn?'\r\n\r\n'And, besides,' I put in, 'where do I come in? I don't see what I've\r\ngot to do with it.'\r\n\r\nBradshaw eyed me fiercely. 'Why, the whole thing was your fault,' he\r\nsaid. 'You told me Yorke was setting the paper.'\r\n\r\n'Well, so he did, didn't he?'\r\n\r\n'No, he didn't. The Old Man set it himself,' said Bradshaw, gloomily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[6]\r\n\r\nA SHOCKING AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bradshaw who appears in the following tale is the same youth who\r\nfigures as the hero--or villain, label him as you like--of the\r\npreceding equally veracious narrative. I mention this because I should\r\nnot care for you to go away with the idea that a waistcoat marked with\r\nthe name of Bradshaw must of necessity cover a scheming heart. It may,\r\nhowever, be noticed that a good many members of the Bradshaw family\r\npossess a keen and rather sinister sense of the humorous, inherited\r\ndoubtless from their great ancestor, the dry wag who wrote that\r\nmonument of quiet drollery, _Bradshaw's Railway Guide_. So with\r\nthe hero of my story.\r\n\r\nFrederick Wackerbath Bradshaw was, as I have pointed out, my\r\ncontemporary at St Austin's. We were in the same House, and together we\r\nsported on the green--and elsewhere--and did our best to turn the\r\nmajority of the staff of masters into confirmed pessimists, they in the\r\nmeantime endeavouring to do the same by us with every weapon that lay\r\nto their hand. And the worst of these weapons were the end-of-term\r\nexamination papers. Mellish was our form-master, and once a term a\r\ndemon entered into Mellish. He brooded silently apart from the madding\r\ncrowd. He wandered through dry places seeking rest, and at intervals he\r\nwould smile evilly, and jot down a note on the back of an envelope.\r\nThese notes, collected and printed closely on the vilest paper, made up\r\nthe examination questions.\r\n\r\nOur form read two authors a term, one Latin and one Greek. It was the\r\nGreek that we feared most. Mellish had a sort of genius for picking out\r\nabsolutely untranslatable passages, and desiring us (in print) to\r\nrender the same with full notes. This term the book had been\r\nThucydides, Book II, with regard to which I may echo the words of a\r\ncertain critic when called upon to give his candid opinion of a\r\nfriend's first novel, 'I dare not say what I think about that book.'\r\n\r\nAbout a week before the commencement of the examinations, the ordinary\r\nnight-work used to cease, and we were supposed, during that week, to be\r\nsteadily going over the old ground and arming ourselves for the\r\napproaching struggle. There were, I suppose, people who actually did do\r\nthis, but for my own part I always used to regard those seven days as a\r\nblessed period of rest, set apart specially to enable me to keep\r\nabreast of the light fiction of the day. And most of the form, so far\r\nas I know, thought the same. It was only on the night before the\r\nexamination that one began to revise in real earnest. One's methods on\r\nthat night resolved themselves into sitting in a chair and wondering\r\nwhere to begin. Just as one came to a decision, it was bedtime.\r\n\r\n'Bradshaw,' I said, as I reached page 103 without having read a line,\r\n'do you know any likely bits?'\r\n\r\nBradshaw looked up from his book. He was attempting to get a general\r\nidea of Thucydides' style by reading _Pickwick_.\r\n\r\n'What?' he said.\r\n\r\nI obliged with a repetition of my remark.\r\n\r\n'Likely bits? Oh, you mean for the Thucydides. I don't know. Mellish\r\nnever sets the bits any decent ordinary individual would set. I should\r\ntake my chance if I were you.'\r\n\r\n'What are you going to do?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to read _Pickwick_. Thicksides doesn't come within a\r\nmile of it.'\r\n\r\nI thought so too.\r\n\r\n'But how about tomorrow?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I shan't be there,' he said, as if it were the most ordinary of\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\n'Not there! Why, have you been sacked?'\r\n\r\nThis really seemed the only possible explanation. Such an event would\r\nnot have come as a surprise. It was always a matter for wonder to me\r\n_why_ the authorities never sacked Bradshaw, or at the least\r\nrequested him to leave. Possibly it was another case of the ass and the\r\nbundles of hay. They could not make up their minds which special\r\nmisdemeanour of his to attack first.\r\n\r\n'No, I've not been sacked,' said Bradshaw.\r\n\r\nA light dawned upon me.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' I said, 'you're going to slumber in.' For the benefit of the\r\nuninitiated, I may mention that to slumber in is to stay in the House\r\nduring school on a pretence of illness.\r\n\r\n'That,' replied the man of mystery, with considerable asperity, 'is\r\nexactly the silly rotten kid's idea that would come naturally to a\r\ncomplete idiot like you.'\r\n\r\nAs a rule, I resent being called a complete idiot, but this was not the\r\ntime for asserting one's personal dignity. I had to know what\r\nBradshaw's scheme for evading the examination was. Perhaps there might\r\nbe room for two in it; in which case I should have been exceedingly\r\nglad to have lent my moral support to it. I pressed for an explanation.\r\n\r\n'You may jaw,' said Bradshaw at last, 'as much as you jolly well\r\nplease, but I'm not going to give this away. All you're going to know\r\nis that I shan't be there tomorrow.'\r\n\r\n'I bet you are, and I bet you do a jolly rank paper too,' I said,\r\nremembering that the sceptic is sometimes vouchsafed revelations to\r\nwhich the most devout believer may not aspire. It is, for instance,\r\nalways the young man who scoffs at ghosts that the family spectre\r\nchooses as his audience. But it required more than a mere sneer or an\r\nempty gibe to pump information out of Bradshaw. He took me up at once.\r\n\r\n'What'll you bet?' he said.\r\n\r\nNow I was prepared to wager imaginary sums to any extent he might have\r\ncared to name, but as my actual worldly wealth at that moment consisted\r\nof one penny, and my expectations were limited to the shilling\r\npocket-money which I should receive on the following Saturday--half of\r\nwhich was already mortgaged--it behoved me to avoid doing anything rash\r\nwith my ready money. But, since a refusal would have meant the downfall\r\nof my arguments, I was obliged to name a figure. I named an even\r\nsixpence. After all, I felt, I must win. By what means, other than\r\nillness, could Bradshaw possibly avoid putting in an appearance at the\r\nThucydides examination?\r\n\r\n'All right,' said Bradshaw, 'an even sixpence. You'll lose.'\r\n\r\n'Slumbering in barred.'\r\n\r\n'Of course.'\r\n\r\n'Real illness barred too,' I said. Bradshaw is a man of resource, and\r\nhas been known to make himself genuinely ill in similar emergencies.\r\n\r\n'Right you are. Slumbering in and real illness both barred. Anything\r\nelse you'd like to bar?'\r\n\r\nI thought.\r\n\r\n'No. Unless--' an idea struck me--'You're not going to run away?'\r\n\r\nBradshaw scorned to answer the question.\r\n\r\n'Now you'd better buck up with your work,' he said, opening his book\r\nagain. 'You've got about as long odds as anyone ever got. But you'll\r\nlose all the same.'\r\n\r\nIt scarcely seemed possible. And yet--Bradshaw was generally right. If\r\nhe said he had a scheme for doing--though it was generally for not\r\ndoing--something, it rarely failed to come off. I thought of my\r\nsixpence, my only sixpence, and felt a distinct pang of remorse. After\r\nall, only the other day the chaplain had said how wrong it was to bet.\r\nBy Jove, so he had. Decent man the chaplain. Pity to do anything he\r\nwould disapprove of. I was on the point of recalling my wager, when\r\nbefore my mind's eye rose a vision of Bradshaw rampant and sneering,\r\nand myself writhing in my chair a crushed and scored-off wreck. I drew\r\nthe line at that. I valued my self-respect at more than sixpence. If it\r\nhad been a shilling now--. So I set my teeth and turned once more to my\r\nThucydides. Bradshaw, having picked up the thread of his story again,\r\nemitted hoarse chuckles like minute guns, until I very nearly rose and\r\nfell upon him. It is maddening to listen to a person laughing and not\r\nto know the joke.\r\n\r\n'You will be allowed two hours for this paper,' said Mellish on the\r\nfollowing afternoon, as he returned to his desk after distributing the\r\nThucydides questions. 'At five minutes to four I shall begin to collect\r\nyour papers, but those who wish may go on till ten past. Write only on\r\none side of the paper, and put your names in the top right-hand corner.\r\nMarks will be given for neatness. Any boy whom I see looking at his\r\nneighbour's--_where's Bradshaw?_'\r\n\r\nIt was already five minutes past the hour. The latest of the late\r\nalways had the decency to appear at least by three minutes past.\r\n\r\n'Has anybody seen Bradshaw?' repeated Mellish. 'You,\r\nwhat's-your-name--' (I am what's-your-name, very much at your\r\nservice) '--you are in his House. Have you seen him?'\r\n\r\nI could have pointed out with some pleasure at this juncture that if\r\nCain expressed indignation at being asked where his brother was, I, by\r\na simple sum in proportion, might with even greater justice feel\r\nannoyed at having to locate a person who was no relative of mine at\r\nall. Did Mr Mellish expect me to keep an eye on every member of my\r\nHouse? Did Mr Mellish--in short, what did he mean by it?\r\n\r\nThis was what I thought. I said, 'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'This is extraordinary,' said Mellish, 'most extraordinary. Why, the\r\nboy was in school this morning.'\r\n\r\nThis was true. The boy had been in school that morning to some purpose,\r\nhaving beaten all records (his own records) in the gentle sport of\r\nMellish-baiting. This evidently occurred to Mellish at the time, for he\r\ndropped the subject at once, and told us to begin our papers.\r\n\r\nNow I have remarked already that I dare not say what I think of\r\nThucydides, Book II. How then shall I frame my opinion of that\r\nexamination paper? It was Thucydides, Book II, with the few easy parts\r\nleft out. It was Thucydides, Book II, with special home-made\r\ndifficulties added. It was--well, in its way it was a masterpiece.\r\nWithout going into details--I dislike sensational and realistic\r\nwriting--I may say that I personally was not one of those who required\r\nan extra ten minutes to finish their papers. I finished mine at\r\nhalf-past two, and amused myself for the remaining hour and a half by\r\nwriting neatly on several sheets of foolscap exactly what I thought of\r\nMr Mellish, and precisely what I hoped would happen to him some day. It\r\nwas grateful and comforting.\r\n\r\nAt intervals I wondered what had become of Bradshaw. I was not\r\nsurprised at his absence. At first I had feared that he would keep his\r\nword in that matter. As time went on I knew that he would. At more\r\nfrequent intervals I wondered how I should enjoy being a bankrupt.\r\n\r\nFour o'clock came round, and found me so engrossed in putting the\r\nfinishing touches to my excursus of Mr Mellish's character, that I\r\nstayed on in the form-room till ten past. Two other members of the form\r\nstayed too, writing with the despairing energy of those who had five\r\nminutes to say what they would like to spread over five hours. At last\r\nMellish collected the papers. He seemed a trifle surprised when I gave\r\nup my modest three sheets. Brown and Morrison, who had their eye on the\r\nform prize, each gave up reams. Brown told me subsequently that he had\r\nonly had time to do sixteen sheets, and wanted to know whether I had\r\nadopted Rutherford's emendation in preference to the old reading in\r\nQuestion II. My prolonged stay had made him regard me as a possible\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nI dwell upon this part of my story, because it has an important bearing\r\non subsequent events. If I had not waited in the form-room I should not\r\nhave gone downstairs just behind Mellish. And if I had not gone\r\ndownstairs just behind Mellish, I should not have been in at the death,\r\nthat is to say the discovery of Bradshaw, and this story would have\r\nbeen all beginning and middle, and no ending, for I am certain that\r\nBradshaw would never have told me a word. He was a most secretive\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nI went downstairs, as I say, just behind Mellish. St Austin's, you must\r\nknow, is composed of three blocks of buildings, the senior, the middle,\r\nand the junior, joined by cloisters. We left the senior block by the\r\ndoor. To the captious critic this information may seem superfluous, but\r\nlet me tell him that I have left the block in my time, and entered it,\r\ntoo, though never, it is true, in the company of a master, in other\r\nways. There are windows.\r\n\r\nOur procession of two, Mellish leading by a couple of yards, passed\r\nthrough the cloisters, and came to the middle block, where the Masters'\r\nCommon Room is. I had no particular reason for going to that block, but\r\nit was all on my way to the House, and I knew that Mellish hated having\r\nhis footsteps dogged. That Thucydides paper rankled slightly.\r\n\r\nIn the middle block, at the top of the building, far from the haunts of\r\nmen, is the Science Museum, containing--so I have heard, I have never\r\nbeen near the place myself--two stuffed rats, a case of mouldering\r\nbutterflies, and other objects of acute interest. The room has a\r\nstaircase all to itself, and this was the reason why, directly I heard\r\nshouts proceeding from that staircase, I deduced that they came from\r\nthe Museum. I am like Sherlock Holmes, I don't mind explaining my\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n'Help!' shouted the voice. 'Help!'\r\n\r\nThe voice was Bradshaw's.\r\n\r\nMellish was talking to M. Gerard, the French master, at the moment. He\r\nhad evidently been telling him of Bradshaw's non-appearance, for at the\r\nsound of his voice they both spun round, and stood looking at the\r\nstaircase like a couple of pointers.\r\n\r\n'Help,' cried the voice again.\r\n\r\nMellish and Gerard bounded up the stairs. I had never seen a French\r\nmaster run before. It was a pleasant sight. I followed. As we reached\r\nthe door of the Museum, which was shut, renewed shouts filtered through\r\nit. Mellish gave tongue.\r\n\r\n'Bradshaw!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' from within.\r\n\r\n'Are you there?' This I thought, and still think, quite a superfluous\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' said Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing in there, Bradshaw? Why were you not in school this\r\nafternoon? Come out at once.' This in deep and thrilling tones.\r\n\r\n'Please, sir,' said Bradshaw complainingly, 'I can't open the door.'\r\nNow, the immediate effect of telling a person that you are unable to\r\nopen a door is to make him try his hand at it. Someone observes that\r\nthere are three things which everyone thinks he can do better than\r\nanyone else, namely poking a fire, writing a novel, and opening a door.\r\n\r\nGerard was no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\n'Can't open the door?' he said. 'Nonsense, nonsense.' And, swooping at\r\nthe handle, he grasped it firmly, and turned it.\r\n\r\nAt this point he made an attempt, a very spirited attempt, to lower the\r\nworld's record for the standing high jump. I have spoken above of the\r\npleasure it gave me to see a French master run. But for good, square\r\nenjoyment, warranted free from all injurious chemicals, give me a\r\nFrench master jumping.\r\n\r\n'My dear Gerard,' said the amazed Mellish.\r\n\r\n'I have received a shock. Dear me, I have received a most terrible\r\nshock.'\r\n\r\nSo had I, only of another kind. I really thought I should have expired\r\nin my tracks with the effort of keeping my enjoyment strictly to\r\nmyself. I saw what had happened. The Museum is lit by electric light.\r\nTo turn it on one has to shoot the bolt of the door, which, like the\r\nhandle, is made of metal. It is on the killing two birds with one stone\r\nprinciple. You lock yourself in and light yourself up with one\r\nmovement. It was plain that the current had gone wrong somehow, run\r\namock, as it were. Mellish meanwhile, instead of being warned by\r\nGerard's fate, had followed his example, and tried to turn the handle.\r\nHis jump, though quite a creditable effort, fell short of Gerard's by\r\nsome six inches. I began to feel as if some sort of round game were\r\ngoing on. I hoped that they would not want me to take a hand. I also\r\nhoped that the thing would continue for a good while longer. The\r\nsuccess of the piece certainly warranted the prolongation of its run.\r\nBut here I was disappointed. The disturbance had attracted another\r\nspectator, Blaize, the science and chemistry master. The matter was\r\nhastily explained to him in all its bearings. There was Bradshaw\r\nentombed within the Museum, with every prospect of death by starvation,\r\nunless he could support life for the next few years on the two stuffed\r\nrats and the case of butterflies. The authorities did not see their way\r\nto adding a human specimen (youth's size) to the treasures in the\r\nMuseum, _so_--how was he to be got out?\r\n\r\nThe scientific mind is equal to every emergency.\r\n\r\n'Bradshaw,' shouted Blaize through the keyhole.\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Are you there?'\r\n\r\nI should imagine that Bradshaw was growing tired of this question by\r\nthis time. Besides, it cast aspersions on the veracity of Gerard and\r\nMellish. Bradshaw, with perfect politeness, hastened to inform the\r\ngentleman that he was there.\r\n\r\n'Have you a piece of paper?'\r\n\r\n'Will an envelope do, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Bless the boy, anything will do so long as it is paper.'\r\n\r\nDear me, I thought, is it as bad as all that? Is Blaize, in despair of\r\never rescuing the unfortunate prisoner, going to ask him to draw up a\r\n'last dying words' document, to be pushed under the door and despatched\r\nto his sorrowing guardian?\r\n\r\n'Put it over your hand, and then shoot back the bolt.'\r\n\r\n'But, sir, the electricity.'\r\n\r\n'Pooh, boy!'\r\n\r\nThe scientific mind is always intolerant of lay ignorance.\r\n\r\n'Pooh, boy, paper is a non-conductor. You won't get hurt.'\r\n\r\nBradshaw apparently acted on his instructions. From the other side of\r\nthe door came the sharp sound of the bolt as it was shot back, and at\r\nthe same time the light ceased to shine through the keyhole. A moment\r\nlater the handle turned, and Bradshaw stepped forth--free!\r\n\r\n'Dear me,' said Mellish. 'Now I never knew that before, Blaize.\r\nRemarkable. But this ought to be seen to. In the meantime, I had better\r\nask the Headmaster to give out that the Museum is closed until further\r\nnotice, I think.'\r\n\r\nAnd closed the Museum has been ever since. That further notice has\r\nnever been given. And yet nobody seems to feel as if an essential part\r\nof their life had ceased to be, so to speak. Curious. Bradshaw, after a\r\nshort explanation, was allowed to go away without a stain--that is to\r\nsay, without any additional stain--on his character. We left the\r\nauthorities discussing the matter, and went downstairs.\r\n\r\n'Sixpence isn't enough,' I said, 'take this penny. It's all I've got.\r\nYou shall have the sixpence on Saturday.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said Bradshaw.' Was the Thucydides paper pretty warm?'\r\n\r\n'Warmish. But, I say, didn't you get a beastly shock when you locked\r\nthe door?'\r\n\r\n'I did the week before last, the first time I ever went to the place.\r\nThis time I was more or less prepared for it. Blaize seems to think\r\nthat paper dodge a special invention of his own. He'll be taking out a\r\npatent for it one of these days. Why, every kid knows that paper\r\ndoesn't conduct electricity.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't,' I said honestly.\r\n\r\n'You don't know much,' said Bradshaw, with equal honesty.\r\n\r\n'I don't,' I replied. 'Bradshaw, you're a great man, but you missed the\r\nbest part of it all.'\r\n\r\n'What, the Thucydides paper?' asked he with a grin.\r\n\r\n'No, you missed seeing Gerard jump quite six feet.'\r\n\r\nBradshaw's face expressed keen disappointment.\r\n\r\n'No, did he really? Oh, I say, I wish I'd seen it.'\r\n\r\nThe moral of which is that the wicked do not always prosper. If\r\nBradshaw had not been in the Museum, he might have seen Gerard jump six\r\nfeet, which would have made him happy for weeks. On second thoughts,\r\nthough, that does not work out quite right, for if Bradshaw had not\r\nbeen in the Museum, Gerard would not have jumped at all. No, better put\r\nit this way. I was virtuous, and I had the pleasure of witnessing the\r\nsight I have referred to. But then there was the Thucydides paper,\r\nwhich Bradshaw missed but which I did not. No. On consideration, the\r\nmoral of this story shall be withdrawn and submitted to a committee of\r\nexperts. Perhaps they will be able to say what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[7]\r\n\r\nTHE BABE AND THE DRAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual inter-house football cup at St Austin's lay between Dacre's,\r\nwho were the holders, and Merevale's, who had been runner-up in the\r\nprevious year, and had won it altogether three times out of the last\r\nfive. The cup was something of a tradition in Merevale's, but of late\r\nDacre's had become serious rivals, and, as has been said before, were\r\nthe present holders.\r\n\r\nThis year there was not much to choose between the two teams. Dacre's\r\nhad three of the First Fifteen and two of the Second; Merevale's two of\r\nthe First and four of the Second. St Austin's being not altogether a\r\nboarding-school, many of the brightest stars of the teams were day\r\nboys, and there was, of course, always the chance that one of these\r\nwould suddenly see the folly of his ways, reform, and become a member\r\nof a House.\r\n\r\nThis frequently happened, and this year it was almost certain to happen\r\nagain, for no less a celebrity than MacArthur, commonly known as the\r\nBabe, had been heard to state that he was negotiating with his parents\r\nto that end. Which House he would go to was at present uncertain. He\r\ndid not know himself, but it would, he said, probably be one of the two\r\nfavourites for the cup. This lent an added interest to the competition,\r\nfor the presence of the Babe would almost certainly turn the scale. The\r\nBabe's nationality was Scots, and, like most Scotsmen, he could play\r\nfootball more than a little. He was the safest, coolest centre\r\nthree-quarter the School had, or had had for some time. He shone in all\r\nbranches of the game, but especially in tackling. To see the Babe\r\nspring apparently from nowhere, in the middle of an inter-school match,\r\nand bring down with violence a man who had passed the back, was an\r\nintellectual treat. Both Dacre's and Merevale's, therefore, yearned for\r\nhis advent exceedingly. The reasons which finally decided his choice\r\nwere rather curious. They arose in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThe Babe's sister was at Girton. A certain Miss Florence Beezley was\r\nalso at Girton. When the Babe's sister revisited the ancestral home at\r\nthe end of the term, she brought Miss Beezley with her to spend a week.\r\nWhat she saw in Miss Beezley was to the Babe a matter for wonder, but\r\nshe must have liked her, or she would not have gone out of her way to\r\nseek her company. Be that as it may, the Babe would have gone a very\r\nlong way out of his way to avoid her company. He led a fine, healthy,\r\nout-of-doors life during that week, and doubtless did himself a lot of\r\ngood. But times will occur when it is imperative that a man shall be\r\nunder the family roof. Meal-times, for instance. The Babe could not\r\nsubsist without food, and he was obliged, Miss Beezley or no Miss\r\nBeezley, to present himself on these occasions. This, by the way, was\r\nin the Easter holidays, so that there was no school to give him an\r\nexcuse for absence.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was a nightmare, lunch was rather worse, and as for dinner,\r\nit was quite unspeakable. Miss Beezley seemed to gather force during\r\nthe day. It was not the actual presence of the lady that revolted the\r\nBabe, for that was passable enough. It was her conversation that\r\nkilled. She refused to let the Babe alone. She was intensely learned\r\nherself, and seemed to take a morbid delight in dissecting his\r\nignorance, and showing everybody the pieces. Also, she persisted in\r\ncalling him Mr MacArthur in a way that seemed somehow to point out and\r\nemphasize his youthfulness. She added it to her remarks as a sort of\r\nafter-thought or echo.\r\n\r\n'Do you read Browning, Mr MacArthur?' she would say suddenly, having\r\napparently waited carefully until she saw that his mouth was full.\r\n\r\nThe Babe would swallow convulsively, choke, blush, and finally say--\r\n\r\n'No, not much.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' This in a tone of pity not untinged with scorn.\r\n\r\n'When you say \"not much\", Mr MacArthur, what exactly do you mean? Have\r\nyou read any of his poems?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, one or two.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! Have you read \"Pippa Passes\"?'\r\n\r\n'No, I think not.'\r\n\r\n'Surely you must know, Mr MacArthur, whether you have or not. Have you\r\nread \"Fifine at the Fair\"?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Have you read \"Sordello\"?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'What _have_ you read, Mr MacArthur?'\r\n\r\nBrought to bay in this fashion, he would have to admit that he had read\r\n'The Pied Piper of Hamelin', and not a syllable more, and Miss Beezley\r\nwould look at him for a moment and sigh softly. The Babe's subsequent\r\nshare in the conversation, provided the Dragon made no further\r\nonslaught, was not large.\r\n\r\nOne never-to-be-forgotten day, shortly before the end of her visit, a\r\nseries of horrible accidents resulted in their being left to lunch\r\ntogether alone. The Babe had received no previous warning, and when he\r\nwas suddenly confronted with this terrible state of affairs he almost\r\nswooned. The lady's steady and critical inspection of his style of\r\ncarving a chicken completed his downfall. His previous experience of\r\ncarving had been limited to those entertainments which went by the name\r\nof 'study-gorges', where, if you wanted to help a chicken, you took\r\nhold of one leg, invited an accomplice to attach himself to the other,\r\nand pulled.\r\n\r\nBut, though unskilful, he was plucky and energetic. He lofted the bird\r\nout of the dish on to the tablecloth twice in the first minute.\r\nStifling a mad inclination to call out 'Fore!' or something to that\r\neffect, he laughed a hollow, mirthless laugh, and replaced the errant\r\nfowl. When a third attack ended in the same way, Miss Beezley asked\r\npermission to try what she could do. She tried, and in two minutes the\r\nchicken was neatly dismembered. The Babe re-seated himself in an\r\nover-wrought state.\r\n\r\n'Tell me about St Austin's, Mr MacArthur,' said Miss Beezley, as the\r\nBabe was trying to think of something to say--not about the weather.\r\n'Do you play football?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!'\r\n\r\nA prolonged silence.\r\n\r\n'Do you--' began the Babe at last.\r\n\r\n'Tell me--' began Miss Beezley, simultaneously.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon,' said the Babe; 'you were saying--?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all, Mr MacArthur. _You_ were saying--?'\r\n\r\n'I was only going to ask you if you played croquet?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; do you?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!'\r\n\r\n'If this is going to continue,' thought the Babe, 'I shall be\r\nreluctantly compelled to commit suicide.'\r\n\r\nThere was another long pause.\r\n\r\n'Tell me the names of some of the masters at St Austin's, Mr\r\nMacArthur,' said Miss Beezley. She habitually spoke as if she were an\r\nexamination paper, and her manner might have seemed to some to verge\r\nupon the autocratic, but the Babe was too thankful that the question\r\nwas not on Browning or the higher algebra to notice this. He reeled off\r\na list of names.\r\n\r\n'... Then there's Merevale--rather a decent sort--and Dacre.'\r\n\r\n'What sort of a man is Mr Dacre?'\r\n\r\n'Rather a rotter, I think.'\r\n\r\n'What is a rotter, Mr MacArthur?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know how to describe it exactly. He doesn't play cricket\r\nor anything. He's generally considered rather a crock.'\r\n\r\n'Really! This is very interesting, Mr MacArthur. And what is a crock? I\r\nsuppose what it comes to,' she added, as the Babe did his best to find\r\na definition, 'is this, that you yourself dislike him.' The Babe\r\nadmitted the impeachment. Mr Dacre had a finished gift of sarcasm which\r\nhad made him writhe on several occasions, and sarcastic masters are\r\nrarely very popular.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Miss Beezley. She made frequent use of that monosyllable. It\r\ngenerally gave the Babe the same sort of feeling as he had been\r\naccustomed to experience in the happy days of his childhood when he had\r\nbeen caught stealing jam.\r\n\r\nMiss Beezley went at last, and the Babe felt like a convict who has\r\njust received a free pardon.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in the following term he was playing fives with\r\nCharteris, a prefect in Merevale's House. Charteris was remarkable from\r\nthe fact that he edited and published at his own expense an unofficial\r\nand highly personal paper, called _The Glow Worm_, which was a\r\ngreat deal more in demand than the recognized School magazine, _The\r\nAustinian_, and always paid its expenses handsomely.\r\n\r\nCharteris had the journalistic taint very badly. He was always the\r\nfirst to get wind of any piece of School news. On this occasion he was\r\nin possession of an exclusive item. The Babe was the first person to\r\nwhom he communicated it.\r\n\r\n'Have you heard the latest romance in high life, Babe?' he observed, as\r\nthey were leaving the court. 'But of course you haven't. You never do\r\nhear anything.'\r\n\r\n'Well?' asked the Babe, patiently.\r\n\r\n'You know Dacre?'\r\n\r\n'I seem to have heard the name somewhere.'\r\n\r\n'He's going to be married.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Don't trouble to try and look interested. You're one of those\r\noffensive people who mind their own business and nobody else's. Only I\r\nthought I'd tell you. Then you'll have a remote chance of understanding\r\nmy quips on the subject in next week's _Glow Worm_. You laddies\r\nfrae the north have to be carefully prepared for the subtler flights of\r\nwit.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said the Babe, placidly. 'Good-night.'\r\n\r\nThe Headmaster intercepted the Babe a few days after he was going home\r\nafter a scratch game of football. 'MacArthur,' said he, 'you pass Mr\r\nDacre's House, do you not, on your way home? Then would you mind asking\r\nhim from me to take preparation tonight? I find I shall be unable to be\r\nthere.' It was the custom at St Austin's for the Head to preside at\r\npreparation once a week; but he performed this duty, like the\r\ncelebrated Irishman, as often as he could avoid it.\r\n\r\nThe Babe accepted the commission. He was shown into the drawing-room.\r\nTo his consternation, for he was not a society man, there appeared to\r\nbe a species of tea-party going on. As the door opened, somebody was\r\njust finishing a remark.\r\n\r\n'... faculty which he displayed in such poems as \"Sordello\",' said the\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe Babe knew that voice.\r\n\r\nHe would have fled if he had been able, but the servant was already\r\nannouncing him. Mr Dacre began to do the honours.\r\n\r\n'Mr MacArthur and I have met before,' said Miss Beezley, for it was\r\nshe. 'Curiously enough, the subject which we have just been discussing\r\nis one in which he takes, I think, a great interest. I was saying, Mr\r\nMacArthur, when you came in, that few of Tennyson's works show the\r\npoetic faculty which Browning displays in \"Sordello\".'\r\n\r\nThe Babe looked helplessly at Mr Dacre.\r\n\r\n'I think you are taking MacArthur out of his depth there,' said Mr\r\nDacre. 'Was there something you wanted to see me about, MacArthur?'\r\n\r\nThe Babe delivered his message.\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, certainly,' said Mr Dacre. 'Shall you be passing the School\r\nHouse tonight? If so, you might give the Headmaster my compliments, and\r\nsay I shall be delighted.'\r\n\r\nThe Babe had had no intention of going out of his way to that extent,\r\nbut the chance of escape offered by the suggestion was too good to be\r\nmissed. He went.\r\n\r\nOn his way he called at Merevale's, and asked to see Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Charteris,' he said, 'you remember telling me that Dacre\r\nwas going to be married?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Well, do you know her name by any chance?'\r\n\r\n'I ken it weel, ma braw Hielander. She is a Miss Beezley.'\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!' said the Babe.\r\n\r\n'Hullo! Why, was your young heart set in that direction? You amaze and\r\npain me, Babe. I think we'd better have a story on the subject in\r\n_The Glow Worm_, with you as hero and Dacre as villain. It shall\r\nend happily, of course. I'll write it myself.'\r\n\r\n'You'd better,' said the Babe, grimly. 'Oh, I say, Charteris.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'When I come as a boarder, I shall be a House-prefect, shan't I, as I'm\r\nin the Sixth?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'And prefects have to go to breakfast and supper, and that sort of\r\nthing, pretty often with the House-beak, don't they?'\r\n\r\n'Such are the facts of the case.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks. That's all. Go away and do some work. Good-night.'\r\n\r\nThe cup went to Merevale's that year. The Babe played a singularly\r\nbrilliant game for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[8]\r\n\r\nTHE MANOEUVRES OF CHARTERIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 1_\r\n\r\n'Might I observe, sir--'\r\n\r\n'You may observe whatever you like,' said the referee kindly.\r\n'Twenty-five.'\r\n\r\n'The rules say--'\r\n\r\n'I have given my decision. Twenty-_five_!' A spot of red appeared\r\non the official cheek. The referee, who had been heckled since the\r\nkick-off, was beginning to be annoyed.\r\n\r\n'The ball went behind without bouncing, and the rules say--'\r\n\r\n'Twenty-FIVE!!' shouted the referee. 'I am perfectly well aware what\r\nthe rules say.' And he blew his whistle with an air of finality. The\r\nsecretary of the Bargees' F.C. subsided reluctantly, and the game was\r\nrestarted.\r\n\r\nThe Bargees' match was a curious institution. Their real name was the\r\nOld Crockfordians. When, a few years before, the St Austin's secretary\r\nhad received a challenge from them, dated from Stapleton, where their\r\nsecretary happened to reside, he had argued within himself as follows:\r\n'This sounds all right. Old Crockfordians? Never heard of Crockford.\r\nProbably some large private school somewhere. Anyhow, they're certain\r\nto be decent fellows.' And he arranged the fixture. It then transpired\r\nthat Old Crockford was a village, and, from the appearance of the team\r\non the day of battle, the Old Crockfordians seemed to be composed\r\nexclusively of the riff-raff of same. They wore green shirts with a\r\nbright yellow leopard over the heart, and C.F.C. woven in large letters\r\nabout the chest. One or two of the outsides played in caps, and the\r\nteam to a man criticized the referee's decisions with point and\r\npungency. Unluckily, the first year saw a weak team of Austinians\r\nrather badly beaten, with the result that it became a point of honour\r\nto wipe this off the slate before the fixture could be cut out of the\r\ncard. The next year was also unlucky. The Bargees managed to score a\r\npenalty goal in the first half, and won on that. The match resulted in\r\na draw in the following season, and by this time the thing had become\r\nan annual event.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the School was getting some of its own back. The Bargees\r\nhad brought down a player of some reputation from the North, and were\r\nas strong as ever in the scrum. But St Austin's had a great team, and\r\nwere carrying all before them. Charteris and Graham at half had the\r\nball out to their centres in a way which made Merevale, who looked\r\nafter the football of the School, feel that life was worth living. And\r\nwhen once it was out, things happened rapidly. MacArthur, the captain\r\nof the team, with Thomson as his fellow-centre, and Welch and Bannister\r\non the wings, did what they liked with the Bargees' three-quarters. All\r\nthe School outsides had scored, even the back, who dropped a neat goal.\r\nThe player from the North had scarcely touched the ball during the\r\nwhole game, and altogether the Bargees were becoming restless and\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nThe kick-off from the twenty-five line which followed upon the small\r\ndiscussion alluded to above, reached Graham. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances he would have kicked, but in a winning game original\r\nmethods often pay. He dodged a furious sportsman in green and yellow,\r\nand went away down the touch-line. He was almost through when he\r\nstumbled. He recovered himself, but too late. Before he could pass,\r\nsomeone was on him. Graham was not heavy, and his opponent was\r\nmuscular. He was swung off his feet, and the next moment the two came\r\ndown together, Graham underneath. A sharp pain shot through his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nA doctor emerged from the crowd--there is always a doctor in a\r\ncrowd--and made an examination.\r\n\r\n'Anything bad?' asked the referee.\r\n\r\n'Collar-bone,' said the doctor. 'The usual, you know. Rather badly\r\nsmashed. Nothing dangerous, of course. Be all right in a month or so.\r\nStop his playing. Rather a pity. Much longer before half-time?'\r\n\r\n'No. I was just going to blow the whistle when this happened.'\r\n\r\nThe injured warrior was carried off, and the referee blew his whistle\r\nfor half-time.\r\n\r\n'I say, Charteris,' said MacArthur, 'who the deuce am I to put half\r\ninstead of Graham?'\r\n\r\n'Rogers used to play half in his childhood, I believe. But, I say, did\r\nyou ever see such a scrag? Can't you protest, or something?'\r\n\r\n'My dear chap, how can I? It's on our own ground. These Bargee beasts\r\nare visitors, if you come to think of it. I'd like to wring the chap's\r\nneck who did it. I didn't spot who it was. Did you see?'\r\n\r\n'Rather. Their secretary. That man with the beard. I'll get Prescott to\r\nmark him this half.'\r\n\r\nPrescott was the hardest tackler in the School. He accepted the\r\ncommission cheerfully, and promised to do his best by the bearded one.\r\n\r\nCharteris certainly gave him every opportunity. When he threw the ball\r\nout of touch, he threw it neatly to the criminal with the beard, and\r\nPrescott, who stuck to him closer than a brother, had generally tackled\r\nhim before he knew what had happened. After a time he began to grow\r\nthoughtful, and when there was a line-out went and stood among the\r\nthree-quarters. In this way much of Charteris's righteous retribution\r\nmiscarried, but once or twice he had the pleasure and privilege of\r\nputting in a piece of tackling on his own account. The match ended with\r\nthe enemy still intact, but considerably shaken. He was also rather\r\nannoyed. He spoke to Charteris on the subject as they were leaving the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n'I was watching you,' he said, _apropos_ of nothing apparently.\r\n\r\n'That must have been nice for you,' said Charteris.\r\n\r\n'You wait.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly. Any time you're passing, I'm sure--'\r\n\r\n'You ain't 'eard the last of me yet.'\r\n\r\n'That's something of a blow,' said Charteris cheerfully, and they\r\nparted.\r\n\r\nCharteris, having got into his blazer, ran after Welch and MacArthur,\r\nand walked back with them to the House. All three of them were at\r\nMerevale's.\r\n\r\n'Poor old Tony,' said MacArthur. 'Where have they taken him to? The\r\nHouse?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Welch. 'I say, Babe, you ought to scratch this match next\r\nyear. Tell 'em the card's full up or something.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know. One expects fairly rough play in this sort of game.\r\nAfter all, we tackle pretty hard ourselves. I know I always try and go\r\nmy hardest. If the man happens to be brittle, that's his lookout,'\r\nconcluded the bloodthirsty Babe.\r\n\r\n'My dear man,' said Charteris, 'there's all the difference between a\r\ndecent tackle and a bally scrag like the one that doubled Tony up. You\r\ncan't break a chap's collar-bone without trying to.'\r\n\r\n'Well, if you come to think of it, I suppose the man must have been\r\nfairly riled. You can't expect a man to be in an angelic temper when\r\nhis side's been licked by thirty points.'\r\n\r\nThe Babe was one of those thoroughly excellent persons who always try,\r\nwhen possible, to make allowances for everybody.\r\n\r\n'Well, dash it,' said Charteris indignantly, 'if he had lost his hair\r\nhe might have drawn the line at falling on Tony like that. It wasn't\r\nthe tackling part of it that crocked him. The beast simply jumped on\r\nhim like a Hooligan. Anyhow, I made him sit up a bit before we\r\nfinished. I gave Prescott the tip to mark him out of touch. Have you\r\never been collared by Prescott? It's a liberal education. Now, there\r\nyou are, you see. Take Prescott. He's never crocked a man seriously in\r\nhis life. I don't count being winded. That's absolutely an accident.\r\nWell, there you are, then. Prescott weighs thirteen-ten, and he's all\r\nmuscle, and he goes like a battering-ram. You'll own that. He goes as\r\nhard as he jolly well knows how, and yet the worst he has ever done is\r\nto lay a man out for a couple of minutes while he gets his wind back.\r\nWell, compare him with this Bargee man. The Bargee weighs a stone less\r\nand isn't nearly as strong, and yet he smashes Tony's collar-bone. It's\r\nall very well, Babe, but you can't get away from it. Prescott tackles\r\nfairly and the Bargee scrags.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said MacArthur, 'I suppose you're right.'\r\n\r\n'Rather,' said Charteris. 'I wish I'd broken his neck.'\r\n\r\n'By the way,' said Welch, 'you were talking to him after the match.\r\nWhat was he saying?'\r\n\r\nCharteris laughed.\r\n\r\n'By Jove, I'd forgotten; he said I hadn't heard the last of him, and\r\nthat I was to wait.'\r\n\r\n'What did you say?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I behaved beautifully. I asked him to be sure and look in any time\r\nhe was passing, and after a few chatty remarks we parted.'\r\n\r\n'I wonder if he meant anything.'\r\n\r\n'I believe he means to waylay me with a buckled belt. I shan't stir out\r\nexcept with the Old Man or some other competent bodyguard. \"'Orrible\r\noutrage, shocking death of a St Austin's schoolboy.\" It would look\r\nrather well on the posters.'\r\n\r\nWelch stuck strenuously to the point.\r\n\r\n'No, but, look here, Charteris,' he said seriously, 'I'm not rotting.\r\nYou see, the man lives in Stapleton, and if he knows anything of School\r\nrules--'\r\n\r\n'Which he doesn't probably. Why should he? Well?'--'If he knows\r\nanything of the rules, he'll know that Stapleton's out of bounds, and\r\nhe may book you there and run you in to Merevale.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said MacArthur. 'I tell you what, you'd do well to knock off a\r\nfew of your expeditions to Stapleton. You know you wouldn't go there\r\nonce a month if it wasn't out of bounds. You'll be a prefect next term.\r\nI should wait till then, if I were you.'\r\n\r\n'My dear chap, what does it matter? The worst that can happen to you\r\nfor breaking bounds is a couple of hundred lines, and I've got a\r\ncapital of four hundred already in stock. Besides, things would be so\r\nslow if you always kept in bounds. I always feel like a cross between\r\nDick Turpin and Machiavelli when I go to Stapleton. It's an awfully\r\njolly feeling. Like warm treacle running down your back. It's cheap at\r\ntwo hundred lines.'\r\n\r\n'You're an awful fool,' said Welch, rudely but correctly.\r\n\r\nWelch was a youth who treated the affairs of other people rather too\r\nseriously. He worried over them. This is not a particularly common\r\ntrait in the character of either boy or man, but Welch had it highly\r\ndeveloped. He could not probably have explained exactly why he was\r\nworried, but he undoubtedly was. Welch had a very grave and serious\r\nmind. He shared a study with Charteris--for Charteris, though not yet a\r\nSchool-prefect, was part owner of a study--and close observation had\r\nconvinced him that the latter was not responsible for his actions, and\r\nthat he wanted somebody to look after him. He had therefore elected\r\nhimself to the post of a species of modified and unofficial guardian\r\nangel to him. The duties were heavy, and the remuneration exceedingly\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n'Really, you know,' said MacArthur, 'I don't see what the point of all\r\nyour lunacy is. I don't know if you're aware of it, but the Old Man's\r\ngetting jolly sick with you.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't know,' said Charteris, 'but I'm very glad to hear it. For\r\nhist! I have a ger-rudge against the person. Beneath my ban that mystic\r\nman shall suffer, _coute que coute_, Matilda. He sat upon\r\nme--publicly, and the resultant blot on my scutcheon can only be wiped\r\nout with blood, or broken rules,' he added.\r\n\r\nThis was true. To listen to Charteris on the subject, one might have\r\nthought that he considered the matter rather amusing than otherwise.\r\nThis, however, was simply due to the fact that he treated everything\r\nflippantly in conversation. But, like the parrot, he thought the more.\r\nThe actual _casus belli_ had been trivial. At least the mere\r\nspectator would have considered it trivial. It had happened after this\r\nfashion. Charteris was a member of the School corps. The orderly-room\r\nof the School corps was in the junior part of the School buildings.\r\nCharteris had been to replace his rifle in that shrine of Mars after a\r\nmid-day drill, and on coming out into the passage had found himself in\r\nthe middle of a junior school 'rag' of the conventional type.\r\nSomebody's cap had fallen off, and two hastily picked teams were\r\nplaying football with it (Association rules). Now, Charteris was not a\r\nprefect (that, it may be observed in passing, was another source of\r\nbitterness in him towards the Powers, for he was fairly high up in the\r\nSixth, and others of his set, Welch, Thomson, and Tony Graham, who were\r\nalso in the Sixth--the two last below him in form order--had already\r\nreceived their prefects' caps). Not being a prefect, it would have been\r\nofficious in him to have stopped the game. So he was passing on with\r\nwhat Mr Hurry Bungsho Jabberjee, B.A., would have termed a beaming\r\nsimper of indescribable suavity, when a member of one of the opposing\r\nteams, in effecting a G. O. Smithian dribble, cannoned into him. To\r\npreserve his balance--this will probably seem a very thin line of\r\ndefence, but 'I state but the facts'--he grabbed at the disciple of\r\nSmith amidst applause, and at that precise moment a new actor appeared\r\non the scene--the Headmaster. Now, of all the things that lay in his\r\nprovince, the Headmaster most disliked to see a senior 'ragging' with a\r\njunior. He had a great idea of the dignity of the senior school, and\r\ndid all that in him lay to see that it was kept up. The greater number\r\nof the juniors with whom the senior was found ragging, the more heinous\r\nthe offence. Circumstantial evidence was dead against Charteris. To all\r\noutward appearances he was one of the players in the impromptu football\r\nmatch. The soft and fascinating beams of the simper, to quote Mr\r\nJabberjee once more, had not yet faded from the act. A well-chosen word\r\nor two from the Headmagisterial lips put a premature end to the\r\nfootball match, and Charteris was proceeding on his way when the\r\nHeadmaster called him. He stopped. The Headmaster was angry. So angry,\r\nindeed, that he did what in a more lucid interval he would not have\r\ndone. He hauled a senior over the coals in the hearing of a number of\r\njuniors, one of whom (unidentified) giggled loudly. As Charteris had on\r\nprevious occasions observed, the Old Man, when he did start to take a\r\nperson's measure, didn't leave out much. The address was not long, but\r\nit covered a great deal of ground. The section of it which chiefly\r\nrankled in Charteris's mind, and which had continued to rankle ever\r\nsince, was that in which the use of the word 'buffoon' had occurred.\r\nEverybody who has a gift of humour and (very naturally) enjoys\r\nexercising it, hates to be called a buffoon. It was Charteris's one\r\nweak spot. Every other abusive epithet in the language slid off him\r\nwithout penetrating or causing him the least discomfort. The word\r\n'buffoon' went home, right up to the hilt. And, to borrow from Mr\r\nJabberjee for positively the very last time, he had observed\r\n(mentally): 'Henceforward I will perpetrate heaps of the lowest dregs\r\nof vice.' He had, in fact, started a perfect bout of breaking rules,\r\nsimply because they were rules. The injustice of the thing rankled. No\r\none so dislikes being punished unjustly as the person who might have\r\nbeen punished justly on scores of previous occasions, if he had only\r\nbeen found out. To a certain extent, Charteris ran amok. He broke\r\nbounds and did little work, and--he was beginning gradually to find\r\nthis out--got thoroughly tired of it all. Offended dignity, however,\r\nstill kept him at it, and much as he would have preferred to have\r\nresumed a less feverish type of existence, he did not do so.\r\n\r\n'I have a ger-rudge against the man,' he said.\r\n\r\n'You _are_ an idiot, really,' said Welch.\r\n\r\n'Welch,' said Charteris, by way of explanation to MacArthur, 'is a lad\r\nof coarse fibre. He doesn't understand the finer feelings. He can't see\r\nthat I am doing this simply for the Old Man's good. Spare the rod,\r\nspile the choild. Let's go and have a look at Tony when we're changed.\r\nHe'll be in the sick-room if he's anywhere.'\r\n\r\n'All right,' said the Babe, as he went into his study. 'Buck up. I'll\r\ntoss you for first bath in a second.'\r\n\r\nCharteris walked on with Welch to their sanctum.\r\n\r\n'You know,' said Welch seriously, stooping to unlace his boots,\r\n'rotting apart, you really are a most awful ass. I wish I could get you\r\nto see it.'\r\n\r\n'Never you mind, ducky,' said Charteris, 'I'm all right. I'll look\r\nafter myself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 2_\r\n\r\nIt was about a week after the Bargees' match that the rules respecting\r\nbounds were made stricter, much to the popular indignation. The penalty\r\nfor visiting Stapleton without leave was increased from two hundred\r\nlines to two extra lessons. The venomous characteristic of extra lesson\r\nwas that it cut into one's football, for the criminal was turned into a\r\nform-room from two till four on half-holidays, and so had to scratch\r\nall athletic engagements for the day, unless he chose to go for a\r\nsolitary run afterwards. In the cricket term the effect of this was not\r\nso deadly. It was just possible that you might get an innings somewhere\r\nafter four o'clock, even if only at the nets. But during the football\r\nseason--it was now February--to be in extra lesson meant a total loss\r\nof everything that makes life endurable, and the School protested (to\r\none another, in the privacy of their studies) with no uncertain voice\r\nagainst this barbarous innovation.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the change had been simple. At the corner of the High\r\nStreet at Stapleton was a tobacconist's shop, and Mr Prater, strolling\r\nin one evening to renew his stock of Pioneer, was interested to observe\r\nP. St H. Harrison, of Merevale's, purchasing a consignment of 'Girl of\r\nmy Heart' cigarettes (at twopence-halfpenny the packet of twenty,\r\nincluding a coloured picture of Lord Kitchener). Now, Mr Prater was one\r\nof the most sportsmanlike of masters. If he had merely met Harrison out\r\nof bounds, and it had been possible to have overlooked him, he would\r\nhave done so. But such a proceeding in the interior of a small shop was\r\nimpossible. There was nothing to palliate the crime. The tobacconist\r\nalso kept the wolf from the door, and lured the juvenile population of\r\nthe neighbourhood to it, by selling various weird brands of sweets, but\r\nit was only too obvious that Harrison was not after these. Guilt was in\r\nhis eye, and the packet of cigarettes in his hand. Also Harrison's\r\nHouse cap was fixed firmly at the back of his head. Mr Prater finished\r\nbuying his Pioneer, and went out without a word. That night it was\r\nannounced to Harrison that the Headmaster wished to see him. The\r\nHeadmaster saw him, though for a certain period of the interview he did\r\nnot see the Headmaster, having turned his back on him by request. On\r\nthe following day Stapleton was placed doubly out of bounds.\r\n\r\nTony, who was still in bed, had not heard the news when Charteris came\r\nto see him on the evening of the day on which the edict had gone forth.\r\n\r\n'How are you getting on?' asked Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Oh, fairly well. It's rather slow.'\r\n\r\n'The grub seems all right.' Charteris absently reached out for a slice\r\nof cake.\r\n\r\n'Not bad.'\r\n\r\n'And you don't have to do any work.'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, it seems to me you're having a jolly good time. What don't\r\nyou like about it?'\r\n\r\n'It's so slow, being alone all day.'\r\n\r\n'Makes you appreciate intellectual conversation all the more when you\r\nget it. Mine, for instance.'\r\n\r\n'I want something to read.'\r\n\r\n'I'll bring you a Sidgwick's _Greek Prose Composition_, if you\r\nlike. Full of racy stories.'\r\n\r\n'I've read 'em, thanks.'\r\n\r\n'How about Jebb's _Homer_? You'd like that. Awfully interesting.\r\nProves that there never was such a man as Homer, you know, and that the\r\n_Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ were produced by evolution. General\r\nstyle, quietly funny. Make you roar.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be an idiot. I'm simply starving for something to read. Haven't\r\nyou got anything?'\r\n\r\n'You've read all mine.'\r\n\r\n'Hasn't Welch got any books?'\r\n\r\n'Not one. He bags mine when he wants to read. I'll tell you what I will\r\ndo if you like.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'Go into Stapleton, and borrow something from Adamson.' Adamson was the\r\nCollege doctor.\r\n\r\n'By Jove, that's not a bad idea.'\r\n\r\n'It's a dashed good idea, which wouldn't have occurred to anybody but a\r\ngenius. I've been quite a pal of Adamson's ever since I had the flu. I\r\ngo to tea with him occasionally, and we talk medical shop. Have you\r\never tried talking medical shop during tea? Nothing like it for giving\r\nyou an appetite.'\r\n\r\n'Has he got anything readable?'\r\n\r\n'Rather. Have you ever tried anything of James Payn's?'\r\n\r\n'I've read _Terminations_, or something,' said Tony doubtfully,\r\n'but he's so obscure.'\r\n\r\n'Don't,' said Charteris sadly, 'please don't. _Terminations_ is by\r\none Henry James, and there is a substantial difference between him and\r\nJames Payn. Anyhow, if you want a short biography of James Payn, he\r\nwrote a hundred books, and they're all simply ripping, and Adamson has\r\ngot a good many of them, and I'm hoping to borrow a couple--any two\r\nwill do--and you're going to read them. I know one always bars a book\r\nthat's recommended to one, but you've got no choice. You're not going\r\nto get anything else till you've finished those two.'\r\n\r\n'All right,' said Tony. 'But Stapleton's out of bounds. I suppose\r\nMerevale'll give you leave to go in.'\r\n\r\n'He won't,' said Charteris. 'I shan't ask him. On principle. So long.'\r\n\r\nOn the following afternoon Charteris went into Stapleton. The distance\r\nby road was almost exactly one mile. If you went by the fields it was\r\nlonger, because you probably lost your way.\r\n\r\nDr Adamson's house was in the High Street. Charteris knocked at the\r\ndoor. The servant was sorry, but the doctor was out. Her tone seemed to\r\nsuggest that, if she had had any say in the matter, he would have\r\nremained in. Would Charteris come in and wait? Charteris rather thought\r\nhe would. He waited for half an hour, and then, as the absent medico\r\ndid not appear to be coming, took two books from the shelf, wrote a\r\nsuccinct note explaining what he had done, and why he had done it,\r\nhoping the doctor would not mind, and went out with his literary\r\ntrophies into the High Street again.\r\n\r\nThe time was now close on five o'clock. Lock-up was not till a quarter\r\npast six--six o'clock nominally, but the doors were always left open\r\ntill a quarter past. It would take him about fifteen minutes to get\r\nback, less if he trotted. Obviously, the thing to do here was to spend\r\na thoughtful quarter of an hour or so inspecting the sights of the\r\ntown. These were ordinarily not numerous, but this particular day\r\nhappened to be market day, and there was a good deal going on. The High\r\nStreet was full of farmers, cows, and other animals, the majority of\r\nthe former well on the road to intoxication. It is, of course,\r\nextremely painful to see a man in such a condition, but when such a\r\nperson is endeavouring to count a perpetually moving drove of pigs, the\r\nonlooker's pain is sensibly diminished. Charteris strolled along the\r\nHigh Street observing these and other phenomena with an attentive eye.\r\nOpposite the Town Hall he was button-holed by a perfect stranger, whom,\r\nby his conversation, he soon recognized as the Stapleton 'character'.\r\nThere is a 'character' in every small country town. He is not a bad\r\ncharacter; still less is he a good character. He is just a 'character'\r\npure and simple. This particular man--or rather, this man, for he was\r\nanything but particular--apparently took a great fancy to Charteris at\r\nfirst sight. He backed him gently against a wall, and insisted on\r\ntelling him an interminable anecdote of his shady past, when, it\r\nseemed, he had been a 'super' in some travelling company. The plot of\r\nthe story, as far as Charteris could follow it, dealt with a theatrical\r\ntour in Dublin, where some person or persons unknown had, with malice\r\nprepense, scattered several pounds of snuff on the stage previous to a\r\nperformance of _Hamlet_; and, according to the 'character', when\r\nthe ghost of Hamlet's father sneezed steadily throughout his great\r\nscene, there was not a dry eye in the house. The 'character' had\r\nconcluded that anecdote, and was half-way through another, when\r\nCharteris, looking at his watch, found that it was almost six o'clock.\r\nHe interrupted one of the 'character's' periods by diving past him and\r\nmoving rapidly down the street. The historian did not seem to object.\r\nCharteris looked round and saw that he had button-holed a fresh victim.\r\nHe was still gazing in one direction and walking in another, when he\r\nran into somebody.\r\n\r\n'Sorry,' said Charteris hastily. 'Hullo!'\r\n\r\nIt was the secretary of the Old Crockfordians, and, to judge from the\r\nscowl on that gentleman's face, the recognition was mutual.\r\n\r\n'It's you, is it?' said the secretary in his polished way.\r\n\r\n'I believe so,' said Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Out of bounds,' observed the man.\r\n\r\nCharteris was surprised. This grasp of technical lore on the part of a\r\ntotal outsider was as unexpected as it was gratifying.\r\n\r\n'What do you know about bounds?' said Charteris.\r\n\r\n'I know you ain't allowed to come 'ere, and you'll get it 'ot from your\r\nmaster for coming.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, but he won't know. I shan't tell him, and I'm sure you will\r\nrespect my secret.'\r\n\r\nCharteris smiled in a winning manner.\r\n\r\n'Ho!' said the man, 'Ho indeed!'\r\n\r\nThere is something very clinching about the word 'Ho'. It seems\r\ndefinitely to apply the closure to any argument. At least, I have never\r\nyet met anyone who could tell me the suitable repartee.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Charteris affably, 'don't let me keep you. I must be going\r\non.'\r\n\r\n'Ho!' observed the man once more. 'Ho indeed!'\r\n\r\n'That's a wonderfully shrewd remark,' said Charteris. 'I can see that,\r\nbut I wish you'd tell me exactly what it means.'\r\n\r\n'You're out of bounds.'\r\n\r\n'Your mind seems to run in a groove. You can't get off that bounds\r\nbusiness. How do you know Stapleton's out of bounds?'\r\n\r\n'I have made enquiries,' said the man darkly.\r\n\r\n'By Jove,' said Charteris delightedly, 'this is splendid. You're a\r\nregular sleuth-hound. I dare say you've found out my name and House\r\ntoo?'\r\n\r\n'I may 'ave,' said the man, 'or I may not 'ave.'\r\n\r\n'Well, now you mention it, I suppose one of the two contingencies is\r\nprobable. Well, I'm awfully glad to have met you. Good-bye. I must be\r\ngoing.'\r\n\r\n'You're goin' with me.'\r\n\r\n'Arm in arm?'\r\n\r\n'I don't want to _'ave_ to take you.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Charteris, 'I should jolly well advise you not to try. This\r\nis my way.'\r\n\r\nHe walked on till he came to the road that led to St Austin's. The\r\nsecretary of the Old Crockfordians stalked beside him with determined\r\nstride.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said Charteris, when they were on the road, 'you mustn't mind if\r\nI walk rather fast. I'm in a hurry.'\r\n\r\nCharteris's idea of walking rather fast was to dash off down the road\r\nat quarter-mile pace. The move took the man by surprise, but, after a\r\nmoment, he followed with much panting. It was evident that he was not\r\nin training. Charteris began to feel that the walk home might be\r\namusing in its way. After they had raced some three hundred yards he\r\nslowed down to a walk again. It was at this point that his companion\r\nevinced a desire to do the rest of the journey with a hand on the\r\ncollar of his coat.\r\n\r\n'If you touch me,' observed Charteris with a surprising knowledge of\r\nlegal _minutiae_, 'it'll be a technical assault, and you'll get\r\nrun in; and you'll get beans anyway if you try it on.'\r\n\r\nThe man reconsidered matters, and elected not to try it on.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile from the College Charteris began to walk rather fast again.\r\nHe was a good half-miler, and his companion was bad at every distance.\r\nAfter a game struggle he dropped to the rear, and finished a hundred\r\nyards behind in considerable straits. Charteris shot in at Merevale's\r\ndoor with five minutes to spare, and went up to his study to worry\r\nWelch by telling him about it.\r\n\r\n'Welch, you remember the Bargee who scragged Tony? Well, there have\r\nbeen all sorts of fresh developments. He's just been pacing me all the\r\nway from Stapleton.'\r\n\r\n'Stapleton! Have you been to Stapleton? Did Merevale give you leave?'\r\n\r\n'No. I didn't ask him.'\r\n\r\n'You _are_ an idiot. And now this Bargee man will go straight to\r\nthe Old Man and run you in. I wonder you didn't think of that.'\r\n\r\n'Curious I didn't.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose he saw you come in here?'\r\n\r\n'Rather. He couldn't have had a better view if he'd paid for a seat.\r\nHalf a second; I must just run up with these volumes to Tony.'\r\n\r\nWhen he came back he found Welch more serious than ever.\r\n\r\n'I told you so,' said Welch. 'You're to go to the Old Man at once. He's\r\njust sent over for you. I say, look here, if it's only lines I don't\r\nmind doing some of them, if you like.'\r\n\r\nCharteris was quite touched by this sporting offer.\r\n\r\n'It's awfully good of you,' he said, 'but it doesn't matter, really. I\r\nshall be all right.'\r\n\r\nTen minutes later he returned, beaming.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Welch, 'what's he given you?'\r\n\r\n'Only his love, to give to you. It was this way. He first asked me if I\r\nwasn't perfectly aware that Stapleton was out of bounds. \"Sir,\" says I,\r\n\"I've known it from childhood's earliest hour.\" \"Ah,\" says he to me,\r\n\"did Mr Merevale give you leave to go in this afternoon?\" \"No,\" says I,\r\n\"I never consulted the gent you mention.\"'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'Then he ragged me for ten minutes, and finally told me I must go into\r\nextra the next two Saturdays.'\r\n\r\n'I thought so.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, but mark the sequel. When he had finished, I said that I was sorry\r\nI had mistaken the rules, but I had thought that a chap was allowed to\r\ngo into Stapleton if he got leave from a master. \"But you said that Mr\r\nMerevale did not give you leave,\" said he. \"Friend of my youth,\" I\r\nreplied courteously, \"you are perfectly correct. As always. Mr Merevale\r\ndid not give me leave, but,\" I added suavely, \"Mr Dacre did.\" And I\r\ncame away, chanting hymns of triumph in a mellow baritone, and leaving\r\nhim in a dead faint on the sofa. And the Bargee, who was present during\r\nthe conflict, swiftly and silently vanished away, his morale\r\nconsiderably shattered. And that, my gentle Welch,' concluded Charteris\r\ncheerfully, 'put me one up. So pass the biscuits, and let us rejoice if\r\nwe never rejoice again.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 3_\r\n\r\nThe Easter term was nearing its end. Football, with the exception of\r\nthe final House-match, which had still to come off, was over, and life\r\nwas in consequence a trifle less exhilarating than it might have been.\r\nIn some ways the last few weeks before the Easter holidays are quite\r\npleasant. You can put on running shorts and a blazer and potter about\r\nthe grounds, feeling strong and athletic, and delude yourself into the\r\nnotion that you are training for the sports. Ten minutes at the broad\r\njump, five with the weight, a few sprints on the track--it is all very\r\namusing and harmless, but it is apt to become monotonous after a time.\r\nAnd if the weather is at all inclined to be chilly, such an occupation\r\nbecomes impossible.\r\n\r\nCharteris found things particularly dull. He was a fair average runner,\r\nbut there were others far better at every distance, so that he saw no\r\nuse in mortifying the flesh with strict training. On the other hand, in\r\nview of the fact that the final House-match had yet to be played, and\r\nthat Merevale's was one of the two teams that were going to play it, it\r\nbehoved him to keep himself at least moderately fit. The genial muffin\r\nand the cheery crumpet were still things to be avoided. He thus found\r\nhimself in a position where, apparently, the few things which it was\r\npossible for him to do were barred, and the net result was that he felt\r\nslightly dull.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, all the rest of his set were working full time\r\nat their various employments, and had no leisure for amusing him. Welch\r\npractised hundred-yard sprints daily, and imagined that it would be\r\nquite a treat for Charteris to be allowed to time him. So he gave him\r\nthe stopwatch, saw him safely to the end of the track, and at a given\r\nsignal dashed off in the approved American style. By the time he\r\nreached the tape, dutifully held by two sporting Merevalian juniors,\r\nCharteris's attention had generally been attracted elsewhere. 'What\r\ntime?' Welch would pant. 'By Jove,' Charteris would observe blandly, 'I\r\nforgot to look. About a minute and a quarter, I fancy.' At which Welch,\r\nwho always had a notion that he had done it in ten and a fifth\r\n_that_ time, at any rate, would dissemble his joy, and mildly\r\nsuggest that somebody else should hold the watch. Then there was Jim\r\nThomson, generally a perfect mine of elevating conversation. He was in\r\nfor the mile and also the half, and refused to talk about anything\r\nexcept those distances, and the best methods for running them in the\r\nminimum of time. Charteris began to feel a blue melancholy stealing\r\nover him. The Babe, again. He might have helped to while away the long\r\nhours, but unfortunately the Babe had been taken very bad with a notion\r\nthat he was going to win the 'cross-country run, and when, in addition\r\nto this, he was seized with a panic with regard to the prospects of the\r\nHouse team in the final, and began to throw out hints concerning strict\r\ntraining, Charteris regarded him as a person to be avoided. If he fled\r\nto the Babe for sympathy now, the Babe would be just as likely as not\r\nto suggest that he should come for a ten-mile spin with him, to get him\r\ninto condition for the final Houser. The very thought of a ten-mile\r\nspin made Charteris feel faint. Lastly, there was Tony. But Tony's\r\ncompany was worse than none at all. He went about with his arm in a\r\nsling, and declined to be comforted. But for his injury, he would by\r\nnow have been training hard for the Aldershot Boxing Competition, and\r\nthe fact that he was now definitely out of it had a very depressing\r\neffect upon him. He lounged moodily about the gymnasium, watching\r\nMenzies, who was to take his place, sparring with the instructor, and\r\nrefused consolation. Altogether, Charteris found life a distinct bore.\r\n\r\nHe was reduced to such straits for amusement, that one Wednesday\r\nafternoon, finding himself with nothing else to do, he was working at a\r\nburlesque and remarkably scurrilous article on 'The Staff, by one who\r\nhas suffered', which he was going to insert in _The Glow Worm_, an\r\nunofficial periodical which he had started for the amusement of the\r\nSchool and his own and his contributors' profit. He was just warming to\r\nhis work, and beginning to enjoy himself, when the door opened without\r\na preliminary knock. Charteris deftly slid a piece of blotting-paper\r\nover his MS., for Merevale occasionally entered a study in this manner.\r\nAnd though there was nothing about Merevale himself in the article, it\r\nwould be better perhaps, thought Charteris, if he did not see it. But\r\nit was not Merevale. It was somebody far worse. The Babe.\r\n\r\nThe Babe was clothed as to his body in football clothes, and as to\r\nface, in a look of holy enthusiasm. Charteris knew what that look\r\nmeant. It meant that the Babe was going to try and drag him out for a\r\nrun.\r\n\r\n'Go away, Babe,' he said, 'I'm busy.'\r\n\r\n'Why on earth are you slacking in here on this ripping afternoon?'\r\n\r\n'Slacking!' said Charteris. 'I like that. I'm doing berrain work, Babe.\r\nI'm writing an article on masters and their customs, which will cause a\r\nprofound sensation in the Common Room. At least it would, if they ever\r\nsaw it, but they won't. Or I hope they won't for their sake _and_\r\nmine. So run away, my precious Babe, and don't disturb your uncle when\r\nhe's busy.'\r\n\r\n'Rot,' said the Babe firmly, 'you haven't taken any exercise for a\r\nweek.'\r\n\r\nCharteris replied proudly that he had wound up his watch only last\r\nnight. The Babe refused to accept the remark as relevant to the matter\r\nin hand.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Alderman,' he said, sitting down on the table, and gazing\r\nsternly at his victim, 'it's all very well, you know, but the final\r\ncomes on in a few days, and you know you aren't in any too good\r\ntraining.'\r\n\r\n'I am,' said Charteris, 'I'm as fit as a prize fighter. Simply full of\r\nbeans. Feel my ribs.'\r\n\r\nThe Babe declined the offer.\r\n\r\n'No, but I say,' he said plaintively, 'I wish you'd treat it seriously.\r\nIt's getting jolly serious, really. If Dacre's win that cup again this\r\nyear, that'll make four years running.'\r\n\r\n'Not so,' said Charteris, like the mariner of\r\ninfinite-resource-and-sagacity; 'not so, but far otherwise. It'll only\r\nmake three.'\r\n\r\n'Well, three's bad enough.'\r\n\r\n'True, oh king, three is quite bad enough.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, there you are. Now you see.'\r\n\r\nCharteris looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n'Would you mind explaining that remark?' he said. 'Slowly.'\r\n\r\nBut the Babe had got off the table, and was prowling round the room,\r\nopening cupboards and boxes.\r\n\r\n'What are you playing at?' enquired Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Where do you keep your footer things?'\r\n\r\n'What do you want with my footer things, if you don't mind my asking?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to help you put them on, and then you're coming for a run.'\r\n\r\n'Ah,' said Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Yes. Just a gentle spin to keep you in training. Hullo, this looks\r\nlike them.'\r\n\r\nHe plunged both hands into a box near the window and flung out a mass\r\nof football clothes. It reminded Charteris of a terrier digging at a\r\nrabbit-hole.\r\n\r\nHe protested.\r\n\r\n'Don't, Babe. Treat 'em tenderly. You'll be spoiling the crease in\r\nthose bags if you heave 'em about like that. I'm very particular about\r\nhow I look on the football field. _I_ was always taught to dress\r\nmyself like a little gentleman, so to speak. Well, now you've seen\r\nthem, put 'em away.'\r\n\r\n'Put 'em on,' said the Babe firmly.\r\n\r\n'You are a beast, Babe. I don't want to go for a run. I'm getting too\r\nold for violent exercise.'\r\n\r\n'Buck up,' said the Babe. 'We mustn't chuck any chances away. Now that\r\nTony can't play, we shall have to do all we know if we want to win.'\r\n\r\n'I don't see what need there is to get nervous about it. Considering\r\nwe've got three of the First three-quarter line, and the Second Fifteen\r\nback, we ought to do pretty well.'\r\n\r\n'But look at Dacre's scrum. There's Prescott, to start with. He's worth\r\nany two of our men put together. Then they've got Carter, Smith, and\r\nHemming out of the first, and Reeve-Jones out of the second. And their\r\noutsides aren't so very bad, if you come to think of it. Bannister's in\r\nthe first, and the other three-quarters are all good. And they've got\r\nboth the second halves. You'll have practically to look after both of\r\nthem now that Tony's crocked. And Baddeley has come on a lot this\r\nterm.'\r\n\r\n'Babe,' said Charteris, 'you have reason. I will turn over a new leaf.\r\nI _will_ be good. Give me my things and I'll come for a run. Only\r\nplease don't let it be anything over twenty miles.'\r\n\r\n'Good man,' said the gratified Babe. 'We won't go far, and will take it\r\nquite easy.'\r\n\r\n'I tell you what,' said Charteris. 'Do you know a place called Worbury?\r\nI thought you wouldn't, probably. It's only a sort of hamlet, two\r\ncottages, three public-houses, and a duck-pond, and that sort of thing.\r\nI only know it because Welch and I ran there once last year. It's in\r\nthe Badgwick direction, about three miles by road, mostly along the\r\nlevel. I vote we muffle up fairly well, blazers and sweaters and so on,\r\nrun to Worbury, tea at one of the cottages, and back in time for\r\nlock-up. How does that strike you?'\r\n\r\n'It sounds all right. How about tea though? Are you certain you can get\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n'Rather. The Oldest Inhabitant is quite a pal of mine.'\r\n\r\nCharteris's circle of acquaintances was a standing wonder to the Babe\r\nand other Merevalians. He seemed to know everybody in the county.\r\n\r\nWhen once he was fairly started on any business, physical or mental,\r\nCharteris generally shaped well. It was the starting that he found the\r\ndifficulty. Now that he was actually in motion, he was enjoying himself\r\nthoroughly. He wondered why on earth he had been so reluctant to come\r\nfor this run. The knowledge that there were three miles to go, and that\r\nhe was equal to them, made him feel a new man. He felt fit. And there\r\nis nothing like feeling fit for dispelling boredom. He swung along with\r\nthe Babe at a steady pace.\r\n\r\n'There's the cottage,' he said, as they turned a bend of the road, and\r\nWorbury appeared a couple of hundred yards away. 'Let's sprint.' They\r\nsprinted, and arrived at the door of the cottage with scarcely a yard\r\nbetween them, much to the admiration of the Oldest Inhabitant, who was\r\nsmoking a thoughtful pipe in his front garden. Mrs Oldest Inhabitant\r\ncame out of the cottage at the sound of voices, and Charteris broached\r\nthe subject of tea. The menu was sumptuous and varied, and even the\r\nBabe, in spite of his devotion to strict training, could scarce forbear\r\nto smile happily at the mention of hot cakes.\r\n\r\nDuring the _mauvais quart d'heure_ before the meal, Charteris kept\r\nup an animated conversation with the Oldest Inhabitant, the Babe\r\njoining in from time to time when he could think of anything to say.\r\nCharteris appeared to be quite a friend of the family. He enquired\r\nafter the Oldest Inhabitant's rheumatics. It was gratifying to find\r\nthat they were distinctly better. How had Mrs O. I. been since his last\r\nvisit? Prarper hearty? Excellent. How was the O. I.'s nevvy?\r\n\r\nAt the mention of his nevvy the O. I. became discursive. He told his\r\naudience everything that had happened in connection with the said nevvy\r\nfor years back. After which he started to describe what he would\r\nprobably do in the future. Amongst other things, there were going to be\r\nsome sports at Rutton today week, and his nevvy was going to try and\r\nwin the cup for what the Oldest Inhabitant vaguely described as 'a\r\nrace'. He had won it last year. Yes, prarper good runner, his nevvy.\r\nWhere was Rutton? the Babe wanted to know. About eight miles out of\r\nStapleton, said Charteris, who was well up in local geography. You got\r\nthere by train. It was the next station.\r\n\r\nMrs O. I. came out to say that tea was ready, and, being drawn into the\r\nconversation on the subject of the Rutton sports, produced a programme\r\nof the same, which her nevvy had sent them. From this it seemed that\r\nthe nevvy's 'spot' event was the egg and spoon race. An asterisk\r\nagainst his name pointed him out as the last year's winner.\r\n\r\n'Hullo,' said Charteris, 'I see there's a strangers' mile. I'm a demon\r\nat the mile when I'm roused. I think I shall go in for it.'\r\n\r\nHe handed the programme back and began his tea.\r\n\r\n'You know, Babe,' he said, as they were going back that evening, 'I\r\nreally think I shall go in for that race. It would be a most awful rag.\r\nIt's the day before the House-match, so it'll just get me fit.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be a fool,' said the Babe. 'There would be a fearful row about\r\nit if you were found out. You'd get extras for the rest of your life.'\r\n\r\n'Well, the final Houser comes off on a Thursday, so it won't affect\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but still--'\r\n\r\n'I shall think about it,' said Charteris. 'You needn't go telling\r\nanyone.'\r\n\r\n'If you'll take my advice, you'll drop it.'\r\n\r\n'Your suggestion has been noted, and will receive due attention,' said\r\nCharteris. 'Put on the pace a bit.'\r\n\r\nThey lengthened their stride, and conversation came to an abrupt end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 4_\r\n\r\n'I shall go, Babe,' said Charteris on the following night.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Form had a slack day before them on the morrow, there being a\r\ntemporary lull in the form-work which occurred about once a week, when\r\nthere was no composition of any kind to be done. The Sixth did four\r\ncompositions a week, two Greek and two Latin, and except for these did\r\nnot bother themselves very much about overnight preparation. The Latin\r\nauthors which the form were doing were Livy and Virgil, and when either\r\nof these were on the next day's programme, most of the Sixth considered\r\nthat they were justified in taking a night off. They relied on their\r\nability to translate both authors at sight and without previous\r\nacquaintance. The popular notion that Virgil is hard rarely appeals to\r\na member of a public school. There are two ways of translating Virgil,\r\nthe conscientious and the other. He prefers the other.\r\n\r\nOn this particular night, therefore, work was 'off'. Merevale was over\r\nat the Great Hall, taking preparation, and the Sixth-Form Merevalians\r\nhad assembled in Charteris's study to talk about things in general. It\r\nwas after a pause of some moments, that had followed upon a lively\r\ndiscussion of the House's prospects in the forthcoming final, that\r\nCharteris had spoken.\r\n\r\n'I shall go, Babe,' said he.\r\n\r\n'Go where?' asked Tony, from the depths of a deck-chair.\r\n\r\n'Babe knows.'\r\n\r\nThe Babe turned to the company and explained.\r\n\r\n'The lunatic's going in for the strangers' mile at some sports at\r\nRutton next week. He'll get booked for a cert. He can't see that. I\r\nnever saw such a man.'\r\n\r\n'Rally round,' said Charteris, 'and reason with me. I'll listen. Tony,\r\nwhat do you think about it?'\r\n\r\nTony expressed his opinion tersely, and Charteris thanked him. Welch,\r\nwho had been reading, now awoke to the fact that a discussion was in\r\nprogress, and asked for details. The Babe explained once more, and\r\nWelch heartily corroborated Tony's remarks. Charteris thanked him too.\r\n\r\n'You aren't really going, are you?' asked Welch.\r\n\r\n'Rather,' said Charteris.\r\n\r\n'The Old Man won't give you leave.'\r\n\r\n'Shan't worry the poor man with such trifles.'\r\n\r\n'But it's miles out of bounds. Stapleton station is out of bounds to\r\nstart with. It's against rules to go in a train, and Rutton's even more\r\nout of bounds than Stapleton.'\r\n\r\n'And as there are sports there,' said Tony, 'the Old Man is certain to\r\nput Rutton specially out of bounds for that day. He always bars a St\r\nAustin's chap going to a place when there's anything going on there.'\r\n\r\n'I don't care. What have I to do with the Old Man's petty prejudices?\r\nNow, let me get at my time-table. Here we are. Now then.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be a fool,' said Tony,\r\n\r\n'Certainly not. Look here, there's a train starts from Stapleton at\r\nthree. I can catch that all right. Gets to Rutton at three-twenty.\r\nSports begin at three-fifteen. At least, they are supposed to. Over\r\nbefore five, I should think. At least, my race will be, though I must\r\nstop to see the Oldest Inhabitant's nevvy win the egg and spoon canter.\r\nBut that ought to come on before the strangers' race. Train back at a\r\nquarter past five. Arrives at a quarter to six. Lock up six-fifteen.\r\nThat gives me half an hour to get here from Stapleton. What more do you\r\nwant? I shall do it easily, and ... the odds against my being booked\r\nare about twenty-five to one. At which price if any gent present cares\r\nto deposit his money, I am willing to take him. Now I'll treat you to a\r\ntune, if you're good.'\r\n\r\nHe went to the cupboard and produced his gramophone. Charteris's\r\nmusical instruments had at one time been strictly suppressed by the\r\nauthorities, and, in consequence, he had laid in a considerable stock\r\nof them. At last, when he discovered that there was no rule against the\r\nuse of musical instruments in the House, Merevale had yielded. The\r\nstipulation that Charteris should play only before prep. was rigidly\r\nobserved, except when Merevale was over at the Hall, and the Sixth had\r\nno work. On such occasions Charteris felt justified in breaking through\r\nthe rule. He had a gramophone, a banjo, a penny whistle, and a mouth\r\norgan. The banjo, which he played really well, was the most in request,\r\nbut the gramophone was also popular.\r\n\r\n'Turn on \"Whistling Rufus\",' observed Thomson.\r\n\r\n'Whistling Rufus' was duly turned on, giving way after an encore to\r\n'Bluebells'.\r\n\r\n'I always weep when I hear this,' said Tony.\r\n\r\n'It _is_ beautiful, isn't it?' said Charteris.\r\n\r\n    I'll be your sweetheart, if you--will be--mine,\r\n    All my life, I'll be your valentine.\r\n    Bluebells I've gathered--grrhhrh.\r\n\r\nThe needle of the gramophone, after the manner of its kind, slipped\r\nraspingly over the surface of the wax, and the rest of the ballad was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n'That,' said Charteris, 'is how I feel with regard to the Old Man. I'd\r\nbe his sweetheart, if he'd be mine. But he makes no advances, and the\r\nstain on my scutcheon is not yet wiped out. I must say I haven't tried\r\ngathering bluebells for him yet, nor have I offered my services as a\r\nperpetual valentine, but I've been very kind to him in other ways.'\r\n\r\n'Is he still down on you?' asked the Babe.\r\n\r\n'He hasn't done much lately. We're in a state of truce at present. Did\r\nI tell you how I scored about Stapleton?'\r\n\r\n'You've only told us about a hundred times,' said the Babe brutally. 'I\r\ntell you what, though, he'll score off you if he finds you going to\r\nRutton.'\r\n\r\n'Let's hope he won't.'\r\n\r\n'He won't,' said Welch suddenly.\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Because you won't go. I'll bet you anything you like that you won't\r\ngo.'\r\n\r\nThat settled Charteris. It was the sort of remark that always acted on\r\nhim like a tonic. He had been intending to go all the time, but it was\r\nthis speech of Welch's that definitely clinched the matter. One of his\r\nmottoes for everyday use was 'Let not thyself be scored off by Welch.'\r\n\r\n'That's all right,' he said. 'Of course I shall go. What's the next\r\nitem you'd like on this machine?'\r\n\r\nThe day of the sports arrived, and the Babe, meeting Charteris at\r\nMerevale's gate, made a last attempt to head him off from his purpose.\r\n\r\n'How are you going to take your things?' he asked. 'You can't carry a\r\nbag. The first beak you met would ask questions.'\r\n\r\nIf he had hoped that this would be a crushing argument, he was\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nCharteris patted a bloated coat pocket.\r\n\r\n'Bags,' he said laconically. 'Vest,' he added, doing the same to his\r\nother pocket. 'Shoes,' he concluded, 'you will observe I am carrying in\r\na handy brown paper parcel, and if anybody wants to know what's in it,\r\nI shall tell them it's acid drops. Sure you won't come, too?'\r\n\r\n'Quite, thanks.'\r\n\r\n'All right. So long then. Be good while I'm gone.'\r\n\r\nAnd he passed on down the road that led to Stapleton.\r\n\r\nThe Rutton Recreation Ground presented, as the _Stapleton Herald_\r\njustly remarked in its next week's issue, 'a gay and animated\r\nappearance'. There was a larger crowd than Charteris had expected. He\r\nmade his way through them, resisting without difficulty the entreaties\r\nof a hoarse gentleman in a check suit to have three to two on 'Enery\r\nsomething for the hundred yards, and came at last to the dressing-tent.\r\n\r\nAt this point it occurred to him that it would be judicious to find out\r\nwhen his race was to start. It was rather a chilly day, and the less\r\ntime he spent in the undress uniform of shorts the better. He bought a\r\ncorrect card for twopence, and scanned it. The strangers' mile was down\r\nfor four-fifty. There was no need to change for an hour yet. He wished\r\nthe authorities could have managed to date the event earlier.\r\n\r\nFour-fifty was running it rather fine. The race would be over by about\r\nfive to five, and it was a walk of some ten minutes to the station,\r\nless if he hurried. That would give him ten minutes for recovering from\r\nthe effects of the race, and changing back into his ordinary clothes\r\nagain. It would be quick work. But, having come so far, he was not\r\ninclined to go back without running in the race. He would never be able\r\nto hold his head up again if he did that. He left the dressing-tent,\r\nand started on a tour of the field.\r\n\r\nThe scene was quite different from anything he had ever witnessed\r\nbefore in the way of sports. The sports at St Austin's were decorous to\r\na degree. These leaned more to the rollickingly convivial. It was like\r\nan ordinary race-meeting, except that men were running instead of\r\nhorses. Rutton was a quiet little place for the majority of the year,\r\nbut it woke up on this day, and was evidently out to enjoy itself. The\r\nRural Hooligan was a good deal in evidence, and though he was\r\ncomparatively quiet just at present, the frequency with which he\r\nvisited the various refreshment stalls that dotted the ground gave\r\npromise of livelier times in the future. Charteris felt that the\r\nafternoon would not be dull.\r\n\r\nThe hour soon passed, and Charteris, having first seen the Oldest\r\nInhabitant's nevvy romp home in the egg and spoon event, took himself\r\noff to the dressing-tent, and began to get into his running clothes.\r\nThe bell for his race was just ringing when he left the tent. He\r\ntrotted over to the starting place.\r\n\r\nApparently there was not a very large 'field'. Two weedy-looking youths\r\nof about Charteris's age, dressed in blushing pink, put in an\r\nappearance, and a very tall, thin man came up almost immediately\r\nafterwards. Charteris had just removed his coat, and was about to get\r\nto his place on the line, when another competitor arrived, and, to\r\njudge by the applause that greeted his appearance, he was evidently a\r\nfavourite in the locality. It was with shock that Charteris recognized\r\nhis old acquaintance, the Bargees' secretary.\r\n\r\nHe was clad in running clothes of a bright orange and a smile of\r\nconscious superiority, and when somebody in the crowd called out 'Go\r\nit, Jarge!' he accepted the tribute as his due, and waved a\r\ncondescending hand in the speaker's direction.\r\n\r\nSome moments elapsed before he recognized Charteris, and the latter had\r\ntime to decide upon his line of action. If he attempted concealment in\r\nany way, the man would recognize that on this occasion, at any rate, he\r\nhad, to use an adequate if unclassical expression, got the bulge, and\r\nthen there would be trouble. By brazening things out, however, there\r\nwas just a chance that he might make him imagine that there was more in\r\nthe matter than met the eye, and that, in some mysterious way, he had\r\nactually obtained leave to visit Rutton that day. After all, the man\r\ndidn't know very much about School rules, and the recollection of the\r\nrecent fiasco in which he had taken part would make him think twice\r\nabout playing the amateur policeman again, especially in connection\r\nwith Charteris.\r\n\r\nSo he smiled genially, and expressed a hope that the man enjoyed robust\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe man replied by glaring in a simple and unaffected manner.\r\n\r\n'Looked up the Headmaster lately?' asked Charteris.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing here?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to run. Hope you don't mind.'\r\n\r\n'You're out of bounds.'\r\n\r\n'That's what you said before. You'd better enquire a bit before you\r\nmake rash statements. Otherwise, there's no knowing what may happen.\r\nPerhaps Mr Dacre has given me leave.'\r\n\r\nThe man said something objurgatory under his breath, but forbore to\r\ncontinue the discussion. He was wondering, as Charteris had expected\r\nthat he would, whether the latter had really got leave or not. It was a\r\ndifficult problem.\r\n\r\nWhether such a result was due to his mental struggles, or whether it\r\nwas simply to be attributed to his poor running, is open to question,\r\nbut the fact remains that the secretary of the Old Crockfordians did\r\nnot shine in the strangers' mile. He came in last but one, vanquishing\r\nthe pink sportsman by a foot. Charteris, after a hot finish, was beaten\r\non the tape by one of the weedy youths, who exhibited astounding\r\nsprinting powers in the last two hundred yards, overhauling Charteris,\r\nwho had led all the time, in fine style, and scoring what the\r\n_Stapleton Herald_ described as a 'highly popular victory'.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had recovered his normal stock of wind--which was not\r\nimmediately--it was borne in upon Charteris that if he wanted to catch\r\nthe five-fifteen back to Stapleton, he had better be beginning to\r\nchange. He went to the dressing-tent, and on examining his watch was\r\nhorrified to find that he had just ten minutes in which to do\r\neverything, and the walk to the station, he reflected, was a long five\r\nminutes. He literally hurled himself into his clothes, and,\r\ndisregarding the Bargee, who had entered the tent and seemed to wish to\r\ncontinue the discussion at the point where they had left off, shot off\r\ntowards the gate nearest the station. He had exactly four minutes and\r\ntwenty-five seconds in which to complete the journey, and he had just\r\nrun a mile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 5_\r\n\r\nFortunately the road was mainly level. On the other hand, he was\r\nhampered by an overcoat. After the first hundred yards he took this\r\noff, and carried it in an unwieldy parcel. This, he found, answered\r\nadmirably. Running became easier. He had worked the stiffness out of\r\nhis legs by this time, and was going well. Three hundred yards from the\r\nstation it was anybody's race. The exact position of the other\r\ncompetitor, the train, could not be defined. It was at any rate not yet\r\nwithin earshot, which meant that it still had at least a quarter of a\r\nmile to go. Charteris considered that he had earned a rest. He slowed\r\ndown to a walk, but after proceeding at this pace for a few yards,\r\nthought that he heard a distant whistle, and dashed on again. Suddenly\r\na raucous bellow of laughter greeted his ears from a spot in front of\r\nhim, hidden from his sight by a bend in the road.\r\n\r\n'Somebody slightly tight,' thought Charteris, rapidly diagnosing the\r\ncase. 'By Jove, if he comes rotting about with me I'll kill him.'\r\nHaving to do anything in a desperate hurry always made Charteris's\r\ntemper slightly villainous. He turned the corner at a sharp trot, and\r\ncame upon two youths who seemed to be engaged in the harmless\r\noccupation of trying to ride a bicycle. They were of the type which he\r\nheld in especial aversion, the Rural Hooligan type, and one at least of\r\nthe two had evidently been present at a recent circulation of the\r\nfestive bowl. He was wheeling the bicycle about the road in an aimless\r\nmanner, and looked as if he wondered what was the matter with it that\r\nit would not stay in the same place for two consecutive seconds. The\r\nother youth was apparently of the 'Charles-his-friend' variety, content\r\nto look on and applaud, and generally to play chorus to his companion's\r\n'lead'. He was standing at the side of the road, smiling broadly in a\r\nway that argued feebleness of mind. Charteris was not quite sure which\r\nof the two types he loathed the more. He was inclined to call it a tie.\r\n\r\nHowever, there seemed to be nothing particularly lawless in what they\r\nwere doing now. If they were content to let him pass without hindrance,\r\nhe, for his part, was content generously to overlook the insult they\r\noffered him in daring to exist, and to maintain a state of truce. But,\r\nas he drew nearer, he saw that there was more in this business than the\r\ncasual spectator might at first have supposed. A second and keener\r\ninspection of the reptiles revealed fresh phenomena. In the first\r\nplace, the bicycle which Hooligan number one was playing with was a\r\nlady's bicycle, and a small one at that. Now, up to the age of fourteen\r\nand the weight of ten stone, a beginner at cycling often finds it more\r\nconvenient to learn to ride on a lady's machine than on a gentleman's.\r\nThe former offers greater facilities for rapid dismounting, a quality\r\nnot to be despised in the earlier stages of initiation. But, though\r\nthis is undoubtedly the case, and though Charteris knew that it was so,\r\nyet he felt instinctively that there was something wrong here.\r\nHooligans of twenty years and twelve stone do not learn to ride on\r\nsmall ladies' machines, or, if they do, it is probably without the\r\npermission of the small lady who owns the same. Valuable as his time\r\nwas, Charteris felt that it behoved him to spend a thoughtful minute or\r\nso examining into this affair. He slowed down once again to a walk,\r\nand, as he did so, his eye fell upon the character in the drama whose\r\nabsence had puzzled him, the owner of the bicycle. And from that moment\r\nhe felt that life would be a hollow mockery if he failed to fall upon\r\nthose revellers and slay them. She stood by the hedge on the right, a\r\nforlorn little figure in grey, and she gazed sadly and helplessly at\r\nthe manoeuvres that were going on in the middle of the road. Her age\r\nCharteris put down at a venture at twelve--a correct guess. Her state\r\nof mind he also conjectured. She was letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I\r\nwould', like the late Macbeth, the cat i' the adage, and numerous other\r\ncelebrities. She evidently had plenty of remarks to make on the subject\r\nin hand, but refrained from motives of prudence.\r\n\r\nCharteris had no such scruples. The feeling of fatigue that had been\r\nupon him had vanished, and his temper, which had been growing steadily\r\nworse for some twenty minutes, now boiled over gleefully at the\r\nprospect of something solid to work itself off upon. Even without a\r\ncause Charteris detested the Rural Hooligan. Now that a real,\r\ncopper-bottomed motive for this dislike had been supplied to him, he\r\nfelt himself capable of dealing with a whole regiment of the breed. The\r\ncriminal with the bicycle had just let it fall with a crash to the\r\nground when Charteris went for him low, in the style which the Babe\r\nalways insisted on seeing in members of the First Fifteen on the\r\nfootball field, and hove him without comment into a damp ditch.\r\n'Charles his friend' uttered a shout of disapproval and rushed into the\r\nfray. Charteris gave him the straight left, of the type to which the\r\ngreat John Jackson is reported to have owed so much in the days of the\r\nold Prize Ring, and Charles, taking it between the eyes, stopped in a\r\ndiscouraged and discontented manner, and began to rub the place.\r\nWhereupon Charteris dashed in, and, to use an expression suitable to\r\nthe deed, 'swung his right at the mark'. The 'mark', it may be\r\nexplained for the benefit of the non-pugilistic, is that portion of the\r\nanatomy which lies hid behind the third button of the human waistcoat.\r\nIt covers--in a most inadequate way--the wind, and even a gentle tap in\r\nthe locality is apt to produce a fleeting sense of discomfort. A\r\ngenuine flush hit on the spot, shrewdly administered by a muscular arm\r\nwith the weight of the body behind it, causes the passive agent in the\r\ntransaction to wish fervently, as far as he is at the moment physically\r\ncapable of wishing anything, that he had never been born. 'Charles his\r\nfriend' collapsed like an empty sack, and Charteris, getting a grip of\r\nthe outlying portions of his costume, dragged him to the ditch and\r\nrolled him in on top of his friend, who had just recovered sufficiently\r\nto be thinking about getting out again. The pair of them lay there in a\r\ntangled heap. Charteris picked up the bicycle and gave it a cursory\r\nexamination. The enamel was a good deal scratched, but no material\r\ndamage had been done. He wheeled it across to its owner.\r\n\r\n'It isn't much hurt,' he said, as they walked on slowly together. 'Bit\r\nscratched, that's all.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks _awfully_,' said the small lady.\r\n\r\n'Oh, not at all,' replied Charteris. 'I enjoyed it.' (He felt he had\r\nsaid the right thing there. Your real hero always 'enjoys it'.) 'I'm\r\nsorry those bargees frightened you.'\r\n\r\n'They did rather. But'--she added triumphantly after a pause--'I didn't\r\ncry.'\r\n\r\n'Rather not,' said Charteris. 'You were awfully plucky. I noticed. But\r\nhadn't you better ride on? Which way were you going?'\r\n\r\n'I wanted to get to Stapleton.'\r\n\r\n'Oh. That's simple enough. You've merely got to go straight on down\r\nthis road, as straight as ever you can go. But, look here, you know,\r\nyou shouldn't be out alone like this. It isn't safe. Why did they let\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\nThe lady avoided his eye. She bent down and inspected the left pedal.\r\n\r\n'They shouldn't have sent you out alone,' said Charteris, 'why did\r\nthey?'\r\n\r\n'They--they didn't. I came.'\r\n\r\nThere was a world of meaning in the phrase. Charteris felt that he was\r\nin the same case. They had not let _him_. He had come. Here was a\r\nkindred spirit, another revolutionary soul, scorning the fetters of\r\nconvention and the so-called authority of self-constituted rules, aha!\r\nBureaucrats!\r\n\r\n'Shake hands,' he said, 'I'm in just the same way.'\r\n\r\nThey shook hands gravely.\r\n\r\n'You know,' said the lady, 'I'm awfully sorry I did it now. It was very\r\nnaughty.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not sorry yet,' said Charteris, 'I'm rather glad than otherwise.\r\nBut I expect I shall be sorry before long.'\r\n\r\n'Will you be sent to bed?'\r\n\r\n'I don't think so.'\r\n\r\n'Will you have to learn beastly poetry?'\r\n\r\n'Probably not.'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously, as if to enquire, 'then if you won't have\r\nto learn poetry and you won't get sent to bed, what on earth is there\r\nfor you to worry about?'\r\n\r\nShe would probably have gone on to investigate the problem further, but\r\nat that moment there came the sound of a whistle. Then another, closer\r\nthis time. Then a faint rumbling, which increased in volume steadily.\r\nCharteris looked back. The railway line ran by the side of the road. He\r\ncould see the smoke of a train through the trees. It was quite close\r\nnow, and coming closer every minute, and he was still quite a hundred\r\nand fifty yards from the station gates.\r\n\r\n'I say,' he cried. 'Great Scott, here comes my train. I must rush.\r\nGood-bye. You keep straight on.'\r\n\r\nHis legs had had time to grow stiff again. For the first few strides\r\nrunning was painful. But his joints soon adapted themselves to the\r\nstrain, and in ten seconds he was sprinting as fast as he had ever\r\nsprinted off the running-track. When he had travelled a quarter of the\r\ndistance the small cyclist overtook him.\r\n\r\n'Be quick,' she said, 'it's just in sight.'\r\n\r\nCharteris quickened his stride, and, paced by the bicycle, spun along\r\nin fine style. Forty yards from the station the train passed him. He\r\nsaw it roll into the station. There were still twenty yards to go,\r\nexclusive of the station's steps, and he was already running as fast as\r\nit lay in him to run. Now there were only ten. Now five. And at last,\r\nwith a hurried farewell to his companion, he bounded up the steps and\r\non to the platform. At the end of the platform the line took a sharp\r\ncurve to the left. Round that curve the tail end of the guard's van was\r\njust disappearing.\r\n\r\n'Missed it, sir,' said the solitary porter, who managed things at\r\nRutton, cheerfully. He spoke as if he was congratulating Charteris on\r\nhaving done something remarkably clever.\r\n\r\n'When's the next?' panted Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Eight-thirty,' was the porter's appalling reply.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Charteris felt quite ill. No train till eight-thirty! Then\r\nwas he indeed lost. But it couldn't be true. There must be some sort of\r\na train between now and then.\r\n\r\n'Are you certain?' he said. 'Surely there's a train before that?'\r\n\r\n'Why, yes, sir,' said the porter gleefully, 'but they be all exprusses.\r\nEight-thirty be the only 'un what starps at Rootton.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said Charteris with marked gloom, 'I don't think that'll be\r\nmuch good to me. My aunt, what a hole I'm in.'\r\n\r\n The porter made a sympathetic and interrogative noise at the back of\r\nhis throat, as if inviting him to explain everything. But Charteris\r\nfelt unequal to conversation. There are moments when one wants to be\r\nalone. He went down the steps again. When he got out into the road, his\r\nsmall cycling friend had vanished. Charteris was conscious of a feeling\r\nof envy towards her. She was doing the journey comfortably on a\r\nbicycle. He would have to walk it. Walk it! He didn't believe he could.\r\nThe strangers' mile, followed by the Homeric combat with the two\r\nHooligans and that ghastly sprint to wind up with, had left him\r\ndecidedly unfit for further feats of pedestrianism. And it was eight\r\nmiles to Stapleton, if it was a yard, and another mile from Stapleton\r\nto St Austin's. Charteris, having once more invoked the name of his\r\naunt, pulled himself together with an effort, and limped gallantly on\r\nin the direction of Stapleton. But fate, so long hostile to him, at\r\nlast relented. A rattle of wheels approached him from behind. A thrill\r\nof hope shot through him at the sound. There was the prospect of a\r\nlift. He stopped, and waited for the dog-cart--it sounded like a\r\ndog-cart--to arrive. Then he uttered a shout of rapture, and began to\r\nwave his arms like a semaphore. The man in the dog-cart was Dr Adamson.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Charteris,' said the Doctor, pulling up his horse, 'what are\r\nyou doing here?'\r\n\r\n'Give me a lift,' said Charteris, 'and I'll tell you. It's a long yarn.\r\nCan I get in?'\r\n\r\n'Come along. Plenty of room.'\r\n\r\nCharteris climbed up, and sank on to the cushioned seat with a sigh of\r\npleasure. What glorious comfort. He had never enjoyed anything more in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n'I'm nearly dead,' he said, as the dog-cart went on again. 'This is how\r\nit all happened. You see, it was this way--'\r\n\r\nAnd he embarked forthwith upon his narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter 6_\r\n\r\nBy special request the Doctor dropped Charteris within a hundred yards\r\nof Merevale's door.\r\n\r\n'Good-night,' he said. 'I don't suppose you will value my advice at\r\nall, but you may have it for what it is worth. I recommend you stop\r\nthis sort of game. Next time something will happen.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove, yes,' said Charteris, climbing painfully down from the\r\ndog-cart, 'I'll take that advice. I'm a reformed character from this\r\nday onwards. This sort of thing isn't good enough. Hullo, there's the\r\nbell for lock-up. Good-night, Doctor, and thanks most awfully for the\r\nlift. It was frightfully kind of you.'\r\n\r\n'Don't mention it,' said Dr Adamson, 'it is always a privilege to be in\r\nyour company. When are you coming to tea with me again?'\r\n\r\n'Whenever you'll have me. I must get leave, though, this time.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. By the way, how's Graham? It is Graham, isn't it? The fellow who\r\nbroke his collar-bone?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, he's getting on splendidly. Still in a sling, but it's almost well\r\nagain now. But I must be off. Good-night.'\r\n\r\n'Good-night. Come to tea next Monday.'\r\n\r\n'Right,' said Charteris; 'thanks awfully.'\r\n\r\nHe hobbled in at Merevale's gate, and went up to his study. The Babe\r\nwas in there talking to Welch.\r\n\r\n'Hullo,' said the Babe, 'here's Charteris.'\r\n\r\n'What's left of him,' said Charteris.\r\n\r\n'How did it go off?'\r\n\r\n'Don't, please.'\r\n\r\n'Did you win?' asked Welch.\r\n\r\n'No. Second. By a yard. Oh, Lord, I am dead.'\r\n\r\n'Hot race?'\r\n\r\n'Rather. It wasn't that, though. I had to sprint all the way to the\r\nstation, and missed my train by ten seconds at the end of it all.'\r\n\r\n'Then how did you get here?'\r\n\r\n'That was the one stroke of luck I've had this afternoon. I started to\r\nwalk back, and after I'd gone about a quarter of a mile, Adamson caught\r\nme up in his dog-cart. I suggested that it would be a Christian act on\r\nhis part to give me a lift, and he did. I shall remember Adamson in my\r\nwill.'\r\n\r\n'Tell us what happened.'\r\n\r\n'I'll tell thee everything I can,' said Charteris. 'There's little to\r\nrelate. I saw an aged, aged man a-sitting on a gate. Where do you want\r\nme to begin?'\r\n\r\n'At the beginning. Don't rot.'\r\n\r\n'I was born,' began Charteris, 'of poor but honest parents, who sent\r\nme to school at an early age in order that I might acquire a grasp of\r\nthe Greek and Latin languages, now obsolete. I--'\r\n\r\n'How did you lose?' enquired the Babe.\r\n\r\n'The other man beat me. If he hadn't, I should have won hands down. Oh,\r\nI say, guess who I met at Rutton.'\r\n\r\n'Not a beak?'\r\n\r\n'No. Almost as bad, though. The Bargee man who paced me from Stapleton.\r\nMan who crocked Tony.'\r\n\r\n'Great _Scott_!' cried the Babe. 'Did he recognize you?'\r\n\r\n'Rather. We had a very pleasant conversation.'\r\n\r\n'If he reports you,' began the Babe.\r\n\r\n'Who's that?'\r\n\r\nCharteris looked up. Tony Graham had entered the study.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Tony! Adamson told me to remember him to you.'\r\n\r\n'So you've got back?'\r\n\r\nCharteris confirmed the hasty guess.\r\n\r\n'But what are you talking about, Babe?' said Tony. 'Who's going to be\r\nreported, and who's going to report?'\r\n\r\nThe Babe briefly explained the situation.\r\n\r\n'If the man,' he said, 'reports Charteris, he may get run in tomorrow,\r\nand then we shall have both our halves away against Dacre's. Charteris,\r\nyou are a fool to go rotting about out of bounds like this.'\r\n\r\n'Nay, dry the starting tear,' said Charteris cheerfully. 'In the first\r\nplace, I shouldn't get kept in on a Thursday anyhow. I should be shoved\r\ninto extra on Saturday. Also, I shrewdly conveyed to the Bargee the\r\nimpression that I was at Rutton by special permission.'\r\n\r\n'He's bound to know that that can't be true,' said Tony.\r\n\r\n'Well, I told him to think it over. You see, he got so badly left last\r\ntime he tried to compass my downfall, that I shouldn't be a bit\r\nsurprised if he let the job alone this journey.'\r\n\r\n'Let's hope so,' said the Babe gloomily.\r\n\r\n'That's right, Babby,' remarked Charteris encouragingly, nodding at the\r\npessimist.\r\n\r\n'You buck up and keep looking on the bright side. It'll be all right.\r\nYou see if it won't. If there's any running in to be done, I shall do\r\nit. I shall be frightfully fit tomorrow after all this dashing about\r\ntoday. I haven't an ounce of superfluous flesh on me. I'm a fine,\r\nstrapping specimen of sturdy young English manhood. And I'm going to\r\nplay a _very_ selfish game tomorrow, Babe.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, my dear chap, you mustn't.' The Babe's face wore an expression of\r\nhorror. The success of the House-team in the final was very near to his\r\nheart. He could not understand anyone jesting on the subject. Charteris\r\nrespected his anguish, and relieved it speedily.\r\n\r\n'I was only ragging,' he said. 'Considering that our three-quarter line\r\nis our one strong point, I'm not likely to keep the ball from it, if I\r\nget a chance of getting it out. Make your mind easy, Babe.'\r\n\r\nThe final House-match was always a warmish game. The rivalry between\r\nthe various Houses was great, and the football cup especially was\r\nfought for with immense keenness. Also, the match was the last fixture\r\nof the season, and there was a certain feeling in the teams that if\r\nthey _did_ happen to disable a man or two, it would not matter\r\nmuch. The injured sportsman would not be needed for School-match\r\npurposes for another six months. As a result of which philosophical\r\nreflection, the tackling was ruled slightly energetic, and the\r\nhanding-off was done with vigour.\r\n\r\nThis year, to add a sort of finishing touch, there was just a little\r\nill-feeling between Dacre's and Merevale's. The cause of it was the\r\nBabe. Until the beginning of the term he had been a day boy. Then the\r\nnews began to circulate that he was going to become a boarder, either\r\nat Dacre's or at Merevale's. He chose the latter, and Dacre's felt\r\nslightly aggrieved. Some of the less sportsmanlike members of the House\r\nhad proposed that a protest should be made against his being allowed to\r\nplay, but, fortunately for the credit of Dacre's, Prescott, the captain\r\nof the House Fifteen, had put his foot down with an emphatic bang at\r\nthe suggestion. As he sagely pointed out, there were some things which\r\nwere bad form, and this was one of them. If the team wanted to express\r\ntheir disapproval, said he, let them do it on the field by tackling\r\ntheir very hardest. He personally was going to do his best, and he\r\nadvised them to do the same.\r\n\r\nThe rumour of this bad blood had got about the School in some\r\nmysterious manner, and when Swift, Merevale's only First Fifteen\r\nforward, kicked off up the hill, a large crowd was lining the ropes. It\r\nwas evident from the outset that it would be a good game.\r\n\r\nDacre's were the better side--as a team. They had no really weak spot.\r\nBut Merevale's extraordinarily strong three-quarter line somewhat made\r\nup for an inferior scrum. And the fact that the Babe was in the centre\r\nwas worth much.\r\n\r\nAt first Dacre's pressed. Their pack was unusually heavy for a\r\nHouse-team, and they made full use of it. They took the ball down the\r\nfield in short rushes till they were in Merevale's twenty-five. Then\r\nthey began to heel, and, if things had been more or less exciting for\r\nthe Merevalians before, they became doubly so now. The ground was dry,\r\nand so was the ball, and the game consequently waxed fast. Time after\r\ntime the ball went along Dacre's three-quarter line, only to end by\r\nfinding itself hurled, with the wing who was carrying it, into touch.\r\nOccasionally the centres, instead of feeding their wings, would try to\r\ndodge through themselves. And that was where the Babe came in. He was\r\nadmittedly the best tackler in the School, but on this occasion he\r\nexcelled himself. His man never had a chance of getting past. At last a\r\nlofty kick into touch over the heads of the spectators gave the players\r\na few seconds' rest.\r\n\r\nThe Babe went up to Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said, 'it's risky, but I think we'll try having the\r\nball out a bit.'\r\n\r\n'In our own twenty-five?' said Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Wherever we are. I believe it will come off all right. Anyway, we'll\r\ntry it. Tell the forwards.'\r\n\r\nFor forwards playing against a pack much heavier than themselves, it is\r\neasier to talk about letting the ball out than to do it. The first half\r\ndozen times that Merevale's scrum tried to heel they were shoved off\r\ntheir feet, and it was on the enemy's side that the ball went out. But\r\nthe seventh attempt succeeded. Out it came, cleanly and speedily.\r\nDaintree, who was playing instead of Tony, switched it across to\r\nCharteris. Charteris dodged the half who was marking him, and ran.\r\nHeeling and passing in one's own twenty-five is like smoking--an\r\nexcellent practice if indulged in in moderation. On this occasion it\r\nanswered perfectly. Charteris ran to the half-way line, and handed the\r\nball on to the Babe. The Babe was tackled from behind, and passed to\r\nThomson. Thomson dodged his man, and passed to Welch on the wing. Welch\r\nwas the fastest sprinter in the School. It was a pleasure--if you did\r\nnot happen to be one of the opposing side--to see him race down the\r\ntouch-line. He was off like an arrow. Dacre's back made a futile\r\nattempt to get at him. Welch could have given the back fifteen yards in\r\na hundred. He ran round him, and, amidst terrific applause from the\r\nMerevale's-supporting section of the audience, scored between the\r\nposts. The Babe took the kick and converted without difficulty. Five\r\nminutes afterwards the whistle blew for half-time.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the game does not call for detailed description.\r\nDacre's pressed nearly the whole of the last half hour, but twice more\r\nthe ball came out and went down Merevale's three-quarter line. Once it\r\nwas the Babe who scored with a run from his own goal-line, and once\r\nCharteris, who got in from half-way, dodging through the whole team.\r\nThe last ten minutes of the game was marked by a slight excess of\r\nenergy on both sides. Dacre's forwards were in a decidedly bad temper,\r\nand fought like tigers to break through, and Merevale's played up to\r\nthem with spirit. The Babe seemed continually to be precipitating\r\nhimself at the feet of rushing forwards, and Charteris felt as if at\r\nleast a dozen bones were broken in various portions of his anatomy. The\r\ngame ended on Merevale's line, but they had won the match and the cup\r\nby two goals and a try to nothing.\r\n\r\nCharteris limped off the field, cheerful but damaged. He ached all\r\nover, and there was a large bruise on his left cheek-bone. He and Babe\r\nwere going to the House, when they were aware that the Headmaster was\r\nbeckoning to them.\r\n\r\n'Well, MacArthur, and what was the result of the match?'\r\n\r\n'We won, sir,' boomed the Babe. 'Two goals and a try to _nil_.'\r\n\r\n'You have hurt your cheek, Charteris?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'How did you do that?'\r\n\r\n'I got a kick, sir, in one of the rushes.'\r\n\r\n'Ah. I should bathe it, Charteris. Bathe it well. I hope it will not be\r\nvery painful. Bathe it well in warm water.'\r\n\r\nHe walked on.\r\n\r\n'You know,' said Charteris to the Babe, as they went into the House,\r\n'the Old Man isn't such a bad sort after all. He has his points, don't\r\nyou think?'\r\n\r\nThe Babe said that he did.\r\n\r\n'I'm going to reform, you know,' continued Charteris confidentially.\r\n\r\n'It's about time,' said the Babe. 'You can have the bath first if you\r\nlike. Only buck up.'\r\n\r\nCharteris boiled himself for ten minutes, and then dragged his weary\r\nlimbs to his study. It was while he was sitting in a deck-chair eating\r\nmixed biscuits, and wondering if he would ever be able to summon up\r\nsufficient energy to put on garments of civilization, that somebody\r\nknocked at the door.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' shouted Charteris. 'What is it? Don't come in. I'm changing.'\r\n\r\nThe melodious treble of Master Crowinshaw, his fag, made itself heard\r\nthrough the keyhole.\r\n\r\n'The Head told me to tell you that he wanted to see you at the School\r\nHouse as soon as you can go.'\r\n\r\n'All right,' shouted Charteris. 'Thanks.'\r\n\r\n'Now what,' he continued to himself, 'does the Old Man want to see me\r\nfor? Perhaps he wants to make certain that I've bathed my cheek in warm\r\nwater. Anyhow, I suppose I must go.'\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later he presented himself at the Headmagisterial\r\ndoor. The sedate Parker, the Head's butler, who always filled Charteris\r\nwith a desire to dig him hard in the ribs just to see what would\r\nhappen, ushered him into the study.\r\n\r\nThe Headmaster was reading by the light of a lamp when Charteris came\r\nin. He laid down his book, and motioned him to a seat; after which\r\nthere was an awkward pause.\r\n\r\n'I have just received,' began the Head at last, 'a most unpleasant\r\ncommunication. Most unpleasant. From whom it comes I do not know. It\r\nis, in fact--er--anonymous. I am sorry that I ever read it.'\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Charteris made no comment. He guessed what was coming. He,\r\ntoo, was sorry that the Head had ever read the letter.\r\n\r\n'The writer says that he saw you, that he actually spoke to you, at the\r\nathletic sports at Rutton yesterday. I have called you in to tell me if\r\nthat is true.' The Head fastened an accusing eye on his companion.\r\n\r\n'It is quite true, sir,' said Charteris steadily.\r\n\r\n'What!' said the Head sharply. 'You were at Rutton?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You were perfectly aware, I suppose, that you were breaking the School\r\nrules by going there, Charteris?' enquired the Head in a cold voice.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.' There was another pause.\r\n\r\n'This is very serious,' began the Head. 'I cannot overlook this. I--'\r\n\r\nThere was a slight scuffle of feet in the passage outside. The door\r\nflew open vigorously, and a young lady entered. It was, as Charteris\r\nrecognized in a minute, his acquaintance of the afternoon, the young\r\nlady of the bicycle.\r\n\r\n'Uncle,' she said, 'have you seen my book anywhere?'\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' she broke off as her eye fell on Charteris.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' said Charteris, affably, not to be outdone in the courtesies.\r\n\r\n'Did you catch your train?'\r\n\r\n'No. Missed it.'\r\n\r\n'Hullo! what's the matter with your cheek?'\r\n\r\n'I got a kick on it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, does it hurt?'\r\n\r\n'Not much, thanks.'\r\n\r\nHere the Head, feeling perhaps a little out of it, put in his oar.\r\n\r\n'Dorothy, you must not come here now. I am busy. And how, may I ask, do\r\nyou and Charteris come to be acquainted?'\r\n\r\n'Why, he's him,' said Dorothy lucidly.\r\n\r\nThe Head looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n'Him. The chap, you know.'\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to the Head's credit that he grasped the meaning of these\r\nwords. Long study of the classics had quickened his faculty for seeing\r\nsense in passages where there was none. The situation dawned upon him.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to tell me, Dorothy, that it was Charteris who came to\r\nyour assistance yesterday?'\r\n\r\nDorothy nodded energetically.\r\n\r\n'He gave the men beans,' she said. 'He did, really,' she went on,\r\nregardless of the Head's look of horror. 'He used right and left with\r\nconsiderable effect.'\r\n\r\nDorothy's brother, a keen follower of the Ring, had been good enough\r\nsome days before to read her out an extract from an account in _The\r\nSportsman_ of a match at the National Sporting Club, and the account\r\nhad been much to her liking. She regarded it as a masterpiece of\r\nEnglish composition.\r\n\r\n'Dorothy,' said the Headmaster, 'run away to bed.' A suggestion which\r\nshe treated with scorn, it wanting a clear two hours to her legal\r\nbedtime. 'I must speak to your mother about your deplorable habit of\r\nusing slang. Dear me, I must certainly speak to her.'\r\n\r\nAnd, shamefully unabashed, Dorothy retired.\r\n\r\nThe Head was silent for a few minutes after she had gone; then he\r\nturned to Charteris again.\r\n\r\n'In consideration of this, Charteris, I shall--er--mitigate slightly\r\nthe punishment I had intended to give you.'\r\n\r\nCharteris murmured his gratification.\r\n\r\n'But,' continued the Head sternly, 'I cannot overlook the offence. I\r\nhave my duty to consider. You will therefore write me--er--ten lines of\r\nVirgil by tomorrow evening, Charteris.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Latin _and_ English,' said the relentless pedagogue.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'And, Charteris--I am speaking now--er--unofficially, not as a\r\nheadmaster, you understand--if in future you would cease to break\r\nSchool rules simply as a matter of principle, for that, I fancy, is what\r\nit amounts to, I--er--well, I think we should get on better together.\r\nAnd that is, on my part at least, a consummation--er--devoutly to be\r\nwished. Good-night, Charteris.'\r\n\r\n'Good-night, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe Head extended a large hand. Charteris took it, and his departure.\r\n\r\nThe Headmaster opened his book again, and turned over a new leaf.\r\nCharteris at the same moment, walking slowly in the direction of\r\nMerevale's, was resolving for the future to do the very same thing. And\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[9]\r\n\r\nHOW PAYNE BUCKED UP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Walkinshaw's affair from the first. Grey, the captain of the St\r\nAustin's Fifteen, was in the infirmary nursing a bad knee. To him came\r\nCharles Augustus Walkinshaw with a scheme. Walkinshaw was football\r\nsecretary, and in Grey's absence acted as captain. Besides these two\r\nthere were only a couple of last year's team left--Reade and Barrett,\r\nboth of Philpott's House.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Grey, how's the knee?' said Walkinshaw.\r\n\r\n'How's the team getting on?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Well, as far as I can see,' said Walkinshaw, 'we ought to have a\r\nrather good season, if you'd only hurry up and come back. We beat a\r\njolly hot lot of All Comers yesterday. Smith was playing for them. The\r\nBlue, you know. And lots of others. We got a goal and a try to\r\n_nil_.'\r\n\r\n'Good,' said Grey. 'Who did anything for us? Who scored?'\r\n\r\n'I got in once. Payne got the other.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove, did he? What sort of a game is he playing this year?'\r\n\r\nThe moment had come for Walkinshaw to unburden himself to his scheme.\r\nHe proceeded to do so.\r\n\r\n'Not up to much,' he said. 'Look here, Grey, I've got rather an idea.\r\nIt's my opinion Payne's not bucking up nearly as much as he might. Do\r\nyou mind if I leave him out of the next game?'\r\n\r\nGrey stared. The idea was revolutionary.\r\n\r\n'What! Leave him out? My good man, he'll be the next chap to get his\r\ncolours. He's a cert. for his cap.'\r\n\r\n'That's just it. He knows he's a cert., and he's slacking on the\r\nstrength of it. Now, my idea is that if you slung him out for a match\r\nor two, he'd buck up extra hard when he came into the team again. Can't\r\nI have a shot at it?'\r\n\r\nGrey weighed the matter. Walkinshaw pressed home his arguments.\r\n\r\n'You see, it isn't like cricket. At cricket, of course, it might put a\r\nchap off awfully to be left out, but I don't see how it can hurt a\r\nman's play at footer. Besides, he's beginning to stick on side\r\nalready.'\r\n\r\n'Is he, by Jove?' said Grey. This was the unpardonable sin. 'Well, I'll\r\ntell you what you can do if you like. Get up a scratch game, First\r\nFifteen _v._ Second, and make him captain of the Second.'\r\n\r\n'Right,' said Walkinshaw, and retired beaming.\r\n\r\nWalkinshaw, it may be remarked at once, to prevent mistakes, was a\r\nwell-meaning idiot. There was no doubt about his being well-meaning.\r\nAlso, there was no doubt about his being an idiot. He was continually\r\ngetting insane ideas into his head, and being unable to get them out\r\nagain. This matter of Payne was a good example of his customary\r\nmethods. He had put his hand on the one really first-class forward St\r\nAustin's possessed, and proposed to remove him from the team. And yet\r\nthrough it all he was perfectly well-meaning. The fact that personally\r\nhe rather disliked Payne had, to do him justice, no weight at all with\r\nhim. He would have done the same by his bosom friend under like\r\ncircumstances. This is the only excuse that can be offered for him. It\r\nwas true that Payne regarded himself as a certainty for his colours, as\r\nfar as anything can be considered certain in this vale of sorrow. But\r\nto accuse him of trading on this, and, to use the vernacular, of\r\nputting on side, was unjust to a degree.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon following this conversation Payne, who was a member of\r\nDacre's House, came into his study and banged his books down on the\r\ntable with much emphasis. This was a sign that he was feeling\r\ndissatisfied with the way in which affairs were conducted in the world.\r\nBowden, who was asleep in an armchair--he had been staying in with a\r\ncold--woke with a start. Bowden shared Payne's study. He played centre\r\nthree-quarter for the Second Fifteen.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' he said.\r\n\r\nPayne grunted. Bowden realized that matters had not been going well\r\nwith him. He attempted to soothe him with conversation, choosing what\r\nhe thought would be a congenial topic.\r\n\r\n'What's on on Saturday?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Scratch game. First _v._ Second.'\r\n\r\nBowden groaned.\r\n\r\n'I know those First _v._ Second games,' he said. 'They turn the\r\nSecond out to get butchered for thirty-five minutes each way, to\r\nimprove the First's combination. It may be fun for the First, but it's\r\nnot nearly so rollicking for us. Look here, Payne, if you find me with\r\nthe pill at any time, you can let me down easy, you know. You needn't\r\ngo bringing off any of your beastly gallery tackles.'\r\n\r\n'I won't,' said Payne. 'To start with, it would be against rules. We\r\nhappen to be on the same side.'\r\n\r\n'Rot, man; I'm not playing for the First.' This was the only\r\nexplanation that occurred to him.\r\n\r\n'I'm playing for the Second.'\r\n\r\n'What! Are you certain?'\r\n\r\n'I've seen the list. They're playing Babington instead of me.'\r\n\r\n'But why? Babington's no good.'\r\n\r\n'I think they have a sort of idea I'm slacking or something. At any\r\nrate, Walkinshaw told me that if I bucked up I might get tried again.'\r\n\r\n'Silly goat,' said Bowden. 'What are you going to do?'\r\n\r\n'I'm going to take his advice, and buck up.'\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHe did. At the beginning of the game the ropes were lined by some\r\nthirty spectators, who had come to derive a languid enjoyment from\r\nseeing the First pile up a record score. By half-time their numbers had\r\nrisen to an excited mob of something over three hundred, and the second\r\nhalf of the game was fought out to the accompaniment of a storm of\r\nyells and counter yells such as usually only belonged to\r\nschool-matches. The Second Fifteen, after a poor start, suddenly awoke\r\nto the fact that this was not going to be the conventional massacre by\r\nany means. The First had scored an unconverted try five minutes after\r\nthe kick-off, and it was after this that the Second began to get\r\ntogether. The school back bungled the drop out badly, and had to find\r\ntouch in his own twenty-five, and after that it was anyone's game. The\r\nscrums were a treat to behold. Payne was a monument of strength. Time\r\nafter time the Second had the ball out to their three-quarters, and\r\njust after half-time Bowden slipped through in the corner. The kick\r\nfailed, and the two teams, with their scores equal now, settled down\r\ngrimly to fight the thing out to a finish. But though they remained on\r\ntheir opponents' line for most of the rest of the game, the Second did\r\nnot add to their score, and the match ended in a draw of three points\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation Grey received of this came to him late in the\r\nevening. He had been reading a novel which, whatever its other merits\r\nmay have been, was not interesting, and it had sent him to sleep. He\r\nawoke to hear a well-known voice observe with some unction: 'Ah! M'yes.\r\nLeeches and hot fomentations.' This effectually banished sleep. If\r\nthere were two things in the world that he loathed, they were leeches\r\nand hot fomentations, and the School doctor apparently regarded them as\r\na panacea for every kind of bodily ailment, from a fractured skull to a\r\ncold in the head. It was this gentleman who had just spoken, but Grey's\r\nalarm vanished as he perceived that the words had no personal\r\napplication to himself. The object of the remark was a fellow-sufferer\r\nin the next bed but one. Now Grey was certain that when he had fallen\r\nasleep there had been nobody in that bed. When, therefore, the medical\r\nexpert had departed on his fell errand, the quest of leeches and hot\r\nfomentations, he sat up and gave tongue.\r\n\r\n'Who's that in that bed?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, Grey,' replied a voice. 'Didn't know you were awake. I've come\r\nto keep you company.'\r\n\r\n'That you, Barrett? What's up with you?'\r\n\r\n'Collar-bone. Dislocated it or something. Reade's over in that corner.\r\nHe has bust his ankle. Oh, yes, we've been having a nice, cheery\r\nafternoon,' concluded Barrett bitterly.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott! How did it happen?'\r\n\r\n'Payne.'\r\n\r\n'Where? In your collar-bone?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. That wasn't what I meant, though. What I was explaining was that\r\nPayne got hold of me in the middle of the field, and threw me into\r\ntouch. After which he fell on me. That was enough for my simple needs.\r\nI'm not grasping.'\r\n\r\n'How about Reade?'\r\n\r\n'The entire Second scrum collapsed on top of Reade. When we dug him out\r\nhis ankle was crocked. Mainspring gone, probably. Then they gathered up\r\nthe pieces and took them gently away. I don't know how it all ended.'\r\n\r\nJust then Walkinshaw burst into the room. He had a large bruise over\r\none eye, his arm was in a sling, and he limped. But he was in excellent\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n'I knew I was right, by Jove,' he observed to Grey. 'I knew he could\r\nbuck up if he liked.'\r\n\r\n'I know it now,' said Barrett.\r\n\r\n'Who's this you're talking about?' said Grey.\r\n\r\n'Payne. I've never seen anything like the game he played today. He was\r\neverywhere. And, by Jove, his _tackling_!'\r\n\r\n'Don't,' said Barrett, wearily.\r\n\r\n'It's the best match I ever played in,' said Walkinshaw, bubbling over\r\nwith enthusiasm. 'Do you know, the Second had all the best of the\r\ngame.'\r\n\r\n'What was the score?'\r\n\r\n'Draw. One try all.'\r\n\r\n'And now I suppose you're satisfied?' enquired Barrett. The great\r\nscheme for the regeneration of Payne had been confided to him by its\r\nproud patentee.\r\n\r\n'Almost,' said Walkinshaw. 'We'll continue the treatment for one more\r\ngame, and then we'll have him simply fizzing for the Windybury match.\r\nThat's next Saturday. By the way, I'm afraid you'll hardly be fit again\r\nin time for that, Barrett, will you?'\r\n\r\n'I may possibly,' said Barrett, coldly, 'be getting about again in time\r\nfor the Windybury match of the year after next. This year I'm afraid I\r\nshall not have the pleasure. And I should strongly advise you, if you\r\ndon't want to have to put a team of cripples into the field, to\r\ndiscontinue the treatment, as you call it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know,' said Walkinshaw.\r\n\r\nOn the following Wednesday evening, at five o'clock, something was\r\ncarried in on a stretcher, and deposited in the bed which lay between\r\nGrey and Barrett. Close scrutiny revealed the fact that it was what had\r\nonce been Charles Augustus Walkinshaw. He was slightly broken up.\r\n\r\n'Payne?' enquired Grey in chilly tones.\r\n\r\nWalkinshaw admitted the impeachment.\r\n\r\nGrey took a pencil and a piece of paper from the table at his side. 'If\r\nyou want to know what I'm doing,' he said, 'I'm writing out the team\r\nfor the Windybury match, and I'm going to make Payne captain, as the\r\nsenior Second Fifteen man. And if we win I'm jolly well going to give\r\nhim his cap after the match. If we don't win, it'll be the fault of a\r\nraving lunatic of the name of Walkinshaw, with his beastly Colney Hatch\r\nschemes for reforming slack forwards. You utter rotter!'\r\n\r\nFortunately for the future peace of mind of C. A. Walkinshaw, the\r\nlatter contingency did not occur. The School, in spite of its\r\nabsentees, contrived to pull the match off by a try to _nil_.\r\nPayne, as was only right and proper, scored the try, making his way\r\nthrough the ranks of the visiting team with the quiet persistence of a\r\nsteam-roller. After the game he came to tea, by request, at the\r\ninfirmary, and was straightaway invested by Grey with his First Fifteen\r\ncolours. On his arrival he surveyed the invalids with interest.\r\n\r\n'Rough game, footer,' he observed at length.\r\n\r\n'Don't mention it,' said Barrett politely. 'Leeches,' he added\r\ndreamily. 'Leeches and hot fomentations. _Boiling_ fomentations.\r\nWill somebody kindly murder Walkinshaw!'\r\n\r\n'Why?' asked Payne, innocently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\nAUTHOR!\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. S. M. Babington, of Dacre's House, was on the horns of a dilemma.\r\nCircumstances over which he had had no control had brought him, like\r\nanother Hercules, to the cross-roads, and had put before him the choice\r\nbetween pleasure and duty, or, rather, between pleasure and what those\r\nin authority called duty. Being human, he would have had little\r\ndifficulty in making his decision, had not the path of pleasure been so\r\nhedged about by danger as to make him doubt whether after all the thing\r\ncould be carried through.\r\n\r\nThe facts in the case were these. It was the custom of the mathematical\r\nset to which J. S. M. Babington belonged, 4B to wit, to relieve the\r\ntedium of the daily lesson with a species of round game which was\r\nplayed as follows. As soon as the master had taken his seat, one of the\r\nplayers would execute a manoeuvre calculated to draw attention on\r\nhimself, such as dropping a book or upsetting the blackboard. Called up\r\nto the desk to give explanation, he would embark on an eloquent speech\r\nfor the defence. This was the cue for the next player to begin. His\r\npart consisted in making his way to the desk and testifying to the\r\nmoral excellence of his companion, and giving in full the reasons why\r\nhe should be discharged without a stain upon his character. As soon as\r\nhe had warmed to his work he would be followed by a third player, and\r\nso on until the standing room around the desk was completely filled\r\nwith a great cloud of witnesses. The duration of the game varied, of\r\ncourse, considerably. On some occasions it could be played through with\r\nsuch success, that the master would enter into the spirit of the thing,\r\nand do his best to book the names of all offenders at one and the same\r\ntime, a feat of no inconsiderable difficulty. At other times matters\r\nwould come to a head more rapidly. In any case, much innocent fun was\r\nto be derived from it, and its popularity was great. On the day,\r\nhowever, on which this story opens, a new master had been temporarily\r\nloosed into the room in place of the Rev. Septimus Brown, who had been\r\nthere as long as the oldest inhabitant could remember. The Rev.\r\nSeptimus was a wrangler, but knew nothing of the ways of the human boy.\r\nHis successor, Mr Reginald Seymour, was a poor mathematician, but a\r\ngood master. He had been, moreover, a Cambridge Rugger Blue. This fact\r\nalone should have ensured him against the customary pleasantries, for a\r\nBlue is a man to be respected. It was not only injudicious, therefore,\r\nbut positively wrong of Babington to plunge against the blackboard on\r\nhis way to his place. If he had been a student of Tennyson, he might\r\nhave remembered that the old order is in the habit of changing and\r\nyielding place to the new.\r\n\r\nMr Seymour looked thoughtfully for a moment\r\nat the blackboard.\r\n\r\n'That was rather a crude effort,' he said pleasantly to Babington, 'you\r\nlack _finesse_. Pick it up again, please.'\r\n\r\nBabington picked it up without protest. Under the rule of the Rev.\r\nSeptimus this would have been the signal for the rest of the class to\r\nleave their places and assist him, but now they seemed to realize that\r\nthere was a time for everything, and that this was decidedly no time\r\nfor indoor games.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said Mr Seymour, when the board was in its place again.\r\n'What is your name? Eh, what? I didn't quite hear.'\r\n\r\n'Babington, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Ah. You had better come in tomorrow at two and work out examples three\r\nhundred to three-twenty in \"Hall and Knight\". There is really plenty of\r\nroom to walk in between that desk and the blackboard. It only wants\r\npractice.'\r\n\r\nWhat was left of Babington then went to his seat. He felt that his\r\nreputation as an artistic player of the game had received a shattering\r\nblow. Then there was the imposition. This in itself would have troubled\r\nhim little. To be kept in on a half-holiday is annoying, but it is one\r\nof those ills which the flesh is heir to, and your true philosopher can\r\nalways take his gruel like a man.\r\n\r\nBut it so happened that by the evening post he had received a letter\r\nfrom a cousin of his, who was a student at Guy's, and from all accounts\r\nwas building up a great reputation in the medical world. From this\r\nletter it appeared that by a complicated process of knowing people who\r\nknew other people who had influence with the management, he had\r\ncontrived to obtain two tickets for a morning performance of the new\r\npiece that had just been produced at one of the theatres. And if Mr J.\r\nS. M. Babington wished to avail himself of the opportunity, would he\r\nwrite by return, and be at Charing Cross Underground bookstall at\r\ntwenty past two.\r\n\r\nNow Babington, though he objected strongly to the drama of ancient\r\nGreece, was very fond of that of the present day, and he registered a\r\nvow that if the matter could possibly be carried through, it should be.\r\nHis choice was obvious. He could cut his engagement with Mr Seymour, or\r\nhe could keep it. The difficulty lay rather in deciding upon one or\r\nother of the alternatives. The whole thing turned upon the extent of\r\nthe penalty in the event of detection.\r\n\r\nThat was his dilemma. He sought advice.\r\n\r\n'I should risk it,' said his bosom friend Peterson.\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't advise you to,' remarked Jenkins.\r\n\r\nJenkins was equally a bosom friend, and in the matter of wisdom in no\r\nway inferior to Peterson.\r\n\r\n'What would happen, do you think?' asked Babington.\r\n\r\n'Sack,' said one authority.\r\n\r\n'Jaw, and double impot,' said another.\r\n\r\n'The _Daily Telegraph_,' muttered the tempter in a stage aside,\r\n'calls it the best comedy since Sheridan.'\r\n\r\n'So it does,' thought Babington. 'I'll risk it.'\r\n\r\n'You'll be a fool if you do,' croaked the gloomy Jenkins. 'You're bound\r\nto be caught.' But the Ayes had it. Babington wrote off that night\r\naccepting the invitation.\r\n\r\nIt was with feelings of distinct relief that he heard Mr Seymour\r\nexpress to another master his intention of catching the twelve-fifteen\r\ntrain up to town. It meant that he would not be on the scene to see him\r\nstart on the 'Hall and Knight'. Unless luck were very much against him,\r\nBabington might reasonably hope that he would accept the imposition\r\nwithout any questions. He had taken the precaution to get the examples\r\nfinished overnight, with the help of Peterson and Jenkins, aided by a\r\nweird being who actually appeared to like algebra, and turned out ten\r\nof the twenty problems in an incredibly short time in exchange for a\r\ncouple of works of fiction (down) and a tea (at a date). He himself\r\nmeant to catch the one-thirty, which would bring him to town in good\r\ntime. Peterson had promised to answer his name at roll-call, a delicate\r\noperation, in which long practice had made him, like many others of the\r\njunior members of the House, no mean proficient.\r\n\r\nIt would be pleasant for a conscientious historian to be able to say\r\nthat the one-thirty broke down just outside Victoria, and that\r\nBabington arrived at the theatre at the precise moment when the curtain\r\nfell and the gratified audience began to stream out. But truth, though\r\nit crush me. The one-thirty was so punctual that one might have thought\r\nthat it belonged to a line other than the line to which it did belong.\r\nFrom Victoria to Charing Cross is a journey that occupies no\r\nconsiderable time, and Babington found himself at his destination with\r\nfive minutes to wait. At twenty past his cousin arrived, and they made\r\ntheir way to the theatre. A brief skirmish with a liveried menial in\r\nthe lobby, and they were in their seats.\r\n\r\nSome philosopher, of extraordinary powers of intuition, once informed\r\nthe world that the best of things come at last to an end. The statement\r\nwas tested, and is now universally accepted as correct. To apply the\r\ngeneral to the particular, the play came to an end amidst uproarious\r\napplause, to which Babington contributed an unstinted quotum, about\r\nthree hours after it had begun.\r\n\r\n'What do you say to going and grubbing somewhere?' asked Babington's\r\ncousin, as they made their way out.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, there's that man Richards,' he continued, before Babington\r\ncould reply that of all possible actions he considered that of going\r\nand grubbing somewhere the most desirable. 'Fellow I know at Guy's, you\r\nknow,' he added, in explanation. 'I'll get him to join us. You'll like\r\nhim, I expect.'\r\n\r\nRichards professed himself delighted, and shook hands with Babington\r\nwith a fervour which seemed to imply that until he had met him life had\r\nbeen a dreary blank, but that now he could begin to enjoy himself\r\nagain. 'I should like to join you, if you don't mind including a friend\r\nof mine in the party,' said Richards. 'He was to meet me here. By the\r\nway, he's the author of that new piece--_The Way of the World.'_\r\n\r\n'Why, we've just been there.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, then you will probably like to meet him. Here he is.'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a man came towards them, and, with a shock that sent all\r\nthe blood in his body to the very summit of his head, and then to the\r\nvery extremities of his boots, Babington recognized Mr Seymour. The\r\nassurance of the programme that the play was by Walter Walsh was a\r\nfraud. Nay worse, a downright and culpable lie. He started with the\r\nvague idea of making a rush for safety, but before his paralysed limbs\r\ncould be induced to work, Mr Seymour had arrived, and he was being\r\nintroduced (oh, the tragic irony of it) to the man for whose benefit he\r\nwas at that very moment supposed to be working out examples three\r\nhundred to three-twenty in 'Hall and Knight'.\r\n\r\nMr Seymour shook hands, without appearing to recognize him. Babington's\r\nblood began to resume its normal position again, though he felt that\r\nthis seeming ignorance of his identity might be a mere veneer, a wile\r\nof guile, as the bard puts it. He remembered, with a pang, a story in\r\nsome magazine where a prisoner was subjected to what the light-hearted\r\ninquisitors called the torture of hope. He was allowed to escape from\r\nprison, and pass guards and sentries apparently without their noticing\r\nhim. Then, just as he stepped into the open air, the chief inquisitor\r\ntapped him gently on the shoulder, and, more in sorrow than in anger,\r\nreminded him that it was customary for condemned men to remain\r\n_inside_ their cells. Surely this was a similar case. But then the\r\nthought came to him that Mr Seymour had only seen him once, and so\r\nmight possibly have failed to remember him, for there was nothing\r\nspecial about Babington's features that arrested the eye, and stamped\r\nthem on the brain for all time. He was rather ordinary than otherwise\r\nto look at. At tea, as bad luck would have it, the two sat opposite one\r\nanother, and Babington trembled. Then the worst happened. Mr Seymour,\r\nwho had been looking attentively at him for some time, leaned forward\r\nand said in a tone evidently devoid of suspicion: 'Haven't we met\r\nbefore somewhere? I seem to remember your face.'\r\n\r\n'Er--no, no,' replied Babington. 'That is, I think not. We may have.'\r\n\r\n'I feel sure we have. What school are you at?'\r\n\r\nBabington's soul began to writhe convulsively.\r\n\r\n'What, what school? Oh, what _school_? Why, er--I'm\r\nat--er--Uppingham.'\r\n\r\nMr Seymour's face assumed a pleased expression.\r\n\r\n'Uppingham? Really. Why, I know several Uppingham fellows. Do you know\r\nMr Morton? He's a master at Uppingham, and a great friend of mine.'\r\n\r\nThe room began to dance briskly before Babington's eyes, but he\r\nclutched at a straw, or what he thought was a straw.\r\n\r\n'Uppingham? Did I say Uppingham? Of course, I mean Rugby, you know,\r\nRugby. One's always mixing the two up, you know. Isn't one?'\r\n\r\nMr Seymour looked at him in amazement. Then he looked at the others as\r\nif to ask which of the two was going mad, he or the youth opposite him.\r\nBabington's cousin listened to the wild fictions which issued from his\r\nlips in equal amazement. He thought he must be ill. Even Richards had a\r\nfleeting impression that it was a little odd that a fellow should\r\nforget what school he was at, and mistake the name Rugby for that of\r\nUppingham, or _vice versa_. Babington became an object of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n'I say, Jack,' said the cousin, 'you're feeling all right, aren't you?\r\nI mean, you don't seem to know what you're talking about. If you're\r\ngoing to be ill, say so, and I'll prescribe for you.'\r\n\r\n'Is he at Rugby?' asked Mr Seymour.\r\n\r\n'No, of course he's not. How could he have got from Rugby to London in\r\ntime for a morning performance? Why, he's at St Austin's.'\r\n\r\nMr Seymour sat for a moment in silence, taking this in. Then he\r\nchuckled. 'It's all right,' he said, 'he's not ill. We have met before,\r\nbut under such painful circumstances that Master Babington very\r\nthoughtfully dissembled, in order not to remind me of them.'\r\n\r\nHe gave a brief synopsis of what had occurred. The audience, exclusive\r\nof Babington, roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n'I suppose,' said the cousin, 'you won't prosecute, will you? It's\r\nreally such shocking luck, you know, that you ought to forget you're a\r\nmaster.'\r\n\r\nMr Seymour stirred his tea and added another lump of sugar very\r\ncarefully before replying. Babington watched him in silence, and wished\r\nthat he would settle the matter quickly, one way or the other.\r\n\r\n'Fortunately for Babington,' said Mr Seymour, 'and unfortunately for\r\nthe cause of morality, I am not a master. I was only a stop-gap, and my\r\nterm of office ceased today at one o'clock. Thus the prisoner at the\r\nbar gets off on a technical point of law, and I trust it will be a\r\nlesson to him. I suppose you had the sense to do the imposition?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, I sat up last night.'\r\n\r\n'Good. Now, if you'll take my advice, you'll reform, or another\r\nday you'll come to a bad end. By the way, how did you manage about\r\nroll-call today?'\r\n\r\n'I thought that was an awfully good part just at the end of the first\r\nact,' said Babington.\r\n\r\nMr Seymour smiled. Possibly from gratification.\r\n\r\n'Well, how did it go off?' asked Peterson that night.\r\n\r\n'Don't, old chap,' said Babington, faintly.\r\n\r\n'I told you so,' said Jenkins at a venture.\r\n\r\nBut when he had heard the whole story he withdrew the remark, and\r\ncommented on the wholly undeserved good luck some people seemed to\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[11]\r\n\r\n'THE TABBY TERROR'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe struggle between Prater's cat and Prater's cat's conscience was\r\nshort, and ended in the hollowest of victories for the former. The\r\nconscience really had no sort of chance from the beginning. It was weak\r\nby nature and flabby from long want of exercise, while the cat was in\r\nexcellent training, and was, moreover, backed up by a strong\r\ntemptation. It pocketed the stakes, which consisted of most of the\r\ncontents of a tin of sardines, and left unostentatiously by the window.\r\nWhen Smith came in after football, and found the remains, he was\r\nsurprised, and even pained. When Montgomery entered soon afterwards, he\r\nquestioned him on the subject.\r\n\r\n'I say, have you been having a sort of preliminary canter with the\r\nbanquet?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Montgomery. 'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Somebody has,' said Smith, exhibiting the empty tin. 'Doesn't seem to\r\nhave had such a bad appetite, either.'\r\n\r\n'This reminds me of the story of the great bear, the medium bear, and\r\nthe little ditto,' observed Montgomery, who was apt at an analogy. 'You\r\nmay remember that when the great bear found his porridge tampered with,\r\nhe--'\r\n\r\nAt this point Shawyer entered. He had been bidden to the feast, and was\r\nfeeling ready for it.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, tea ready?' he asked.\r\n\r\nSmith displayed the sardine tin in much the same manner as the conjurer\r\nshows a pack of cards when he entreats you to choose one, and remember\r\nthe number.\r\n\r\n'You haven't finished already, surely? Why, it's only just five.'\r\n\r\n'We haven't even begun,' said Smith. 'That's just the difficulty. The\r\nquestion is, who has been on the raid in here?'\r\n\r\n'No human being has done this horrid thing,' said Montgomery. He always\r\nliked to introduce a Holmes-Watsonian touch into the conversation. 'In\r\nthe first place, the door was locked, wasn't it, Smith?'\r\n\r\n'By Jove, so it was. Then how on earth--?'\r\n\r\n'Through the window, of course. The cat, equally of course. I should\r\nlike a private word with that cat.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose it must have been.'\r\n\r\n'Of course it was. Apart from the merely circumstantial evidence, which\r\nis strong enough to hang it off its own bat, we have absolute proof of\r\nits guilt. Just cast your eye over that butter. You follow me, Watson?'\r\n\r\nThe butter was submitted to inspection. In the very centre of it there\r\nwas a footprint.\r\n\r\n'_I_ traced his little footprints in the butter,' said Montgomery.\r\n'Now, is that the mark of a human foot?'\r\n\r\nThe jury brought in a unanimous verdict of guilty against the missing\r\nanimal, and over a sorrowful cup of tea, eked out with bread and\r\njam--butter appeared to be unpopular--discussed the matter in all its\r\nbearings. The cat had not been an inmate of Prater's House for a very\r\nlong time, and up till now what depredation it had committed had been\r\nconfined to the official larder. Now, however, it had evidently got its\r\nhand in, and was about to commence operations upon a more extensive\r\nscale. The Tabby Terror had begun. Where would it end? The general\r\nopinion was that something would have to be done about it. No one\r\nseemed to know exactly what to do. Montgomery spoke darkly of bricks,\r\nbits of string, and horse-ponds. Smith rolled the word 'rat-poison'\r\nluxuriously round his tongue. Shawyer, who was something of an expert\r\non the range, babbled of air-guns.\r\n\r\nAt tea on the following evening the first really serious engagement of\r\nthe campaign took place. The cat strolled into the tea-room in the\r\npatronizing way characteristic of his kind, but was heavily shelled\r\nwith lump-sugar, and beat a rapid retreat. That was the signal for the\r\noutbreak of serious hostilities. From that moment its paw was against\r\nevery man, and the tale of the things it stole is too terrible to\r\nrelate in detail. It scored all along the line. Like Death in the poem,\r\nit knocked at the doors of the highest and the lowest alike. Or rather,\r\nit did not exactly knock. It came in without knocking. The palace of\r\nthe prefect and the hovel of the fag suffered equally. Trentham, the\r\nhead of the House, lost sausages to an incredible amount one evening,\r\nand the next day Ripton, of the Lower Third, was robbed of his one ewe\r\nlamb in the shape of half a tin of anchovy paste. Panic reigned.\r\n\r\nIt was after this matter of the sausages that a luminous idea occurred\r\nto Trentham. He had been laid up with a slight football accident, and\r\nhis family, reading between the lines of his written statement that he\r\n'had got crocked at footer, nothing much, only (rather a nuisance)\r\nmight do him out of the House-matches', a notification of mortal\r\ninjuries, and seeming to hear a death-rattle through the words 'felt\r\nrather chippy yesterday', had come down _en masse_ to investigate.\r\n_En masse,_ that is to say, with the exception of his father, who\r\nsaid he was too busy, but felt sure it was nothing serious. ('Why, when\r\nI was a boy, my dear, I used to think nothing of an occasional tumble.\r\nThere's nothing the matter with Dick. Why, etc., etc.')\r\n\r\nTrentham's sister was his first visitor.\r\n\r\n'I say,' said he, when he had satisfied her on the subject of his\r\nhealth, 'would you like to do me a good turn?'\r\n\r\nShe intimated that she would be delighted, and asked for details.\r\n\r\n_'Buy the beak's cat,'_ hissed Trentham, in a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n'Dick, it _was_ your leg that you hurt, wasn't it? Not--not your\r\nhead?' she replied. 'I mean--'\r\n\r\n'No, I really mean it. Why can't you? It's a perfectly simple thing to\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n'But what _is_ a beak? And why should I buy its cat?'\r\n\r\n'A beak's a master. Surely you know that. You see, Prater's got a cat\r\nlately, and the beast strolls in and raids the studies. Got round over\r\nhalf a pound of prime sausages in here the other night, and he's always\r\nbagging things everywhere. You'd be doing everyone a kindness if you\r\nwould take him on. He'll get lynched some day if you don't. Besides,\r\nyou want a cat for your new house, surely. Keep down the mice, and that\r\nsort of thing, you know. This animal's a demon for mice.' This was a\r\ntelling argument. Trentham's sister had lately been married, and she\r\ncertainly had had some idea of investing in a cat to adorn her home.\r\n'As for beetles,' continued the invalid, pushing home his advantage,\r\n'they simply daren't come out of their lairs for fear of him.'\r\n\r\n'If he eats beetles,' objected his sister, 'he can't have a very good\r\ncoat.'\r\n\r\n'He doesn't eat them. Just squashes them, you know, like a policeman.\r\nHe's a decent enough beast as far as looks go.'\r\n\r\n'But if he steals things--'\r\n\r\n'No, don't you see, he only does that here, because the Praters don't\r\ninterfere with him and don't let us do anything to him. He won't try\r\nthat sort of thing on with you. If he does, get somebody to hit him\r\nover the head with a boot-jack or something. He'll soon drop it then.\r\nYou might as well, you know. The House'll simply black your boots if\r\nyou do.'\r\n\r\n'But would Mr Prater let me have the cat?'\r\n\r\n'Try him, anyhow. Pitch it fairly warm, you know. Only cat you ever\r\nloved, and that sort of thing.'\r\n\r\n'Very well. I'll try.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks, awfully. And, I say, you might just look in here on your way\r\nout and report.'\r\n\r\nMrs James Williamson, nee Miss Trentham, made her way dutifully to the\r\nMerevale's part of the House. Mrs Prater had expressed a hope that she\r\nwould have some tea before catching her train. With tea it is usual to\r\nhave milk, and with milk it is usual, if there is a cat in the house,\r\nto have feline society. Captain Kettle, which was the name thought\r\nsuitable to this cat by his godfathers and godmothers, was on hand\r\nearly. As he stood there pawing the mat impatiently, and mewing in a\r\nminor key, Mrs Williamson felt that here was the cat for her. He\r\ncertainly was good to look upon. His black heart was hidden by a sleek\r\ncoat of tabby fur, which rendered stroking a luxury. His scheming brain\r\nwas out of sight in a shapely head.\r\n\r\n'Oh, what a lovely cat!' said Mrs Williamson.\r\n\r\n'Yes, isn't he,' agreed Mrs Prater. 'We are very proud of him.'\r\n\r\n'Such a beautiful coat!'\r\n\r\n'And such a sweet purr!'\r\n\r\n'He looks so intelligent. Has he any tricks?'\r\n\r\nHad he any tricks! Why, Mrs Williamson, he could do everything except\r\nspeak. Captain Kettle, you bad boy, come here and die for your country.\r\nPuss, puss.\r\n\r\nCaptain Kettle came at last reluctantly, died for his country in record\r\ntime, and flashed back again to the saucer. He had an important\r\nappointment. Sorry to appear rude and all that sort of thing, don't you\r\nknow, but he had to see a cat about a mouse.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Trentham, when his sister looked in upon him an hour\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Dick, it's the nicest cat I ever saw. I shall never be happy if I\r\ndon't get it.'\r\n\r\n'Have you bought it?' asked the practical Trentham.\r\n\r\n'My dear Dick, I couldn't. We couldn't bargain about a cat during tea.\r\nWhy, I never met Mrs Prater before this afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'No, I suppose not,' admitted Trentham, gloomily. 'Anyhow, look here,\r\nif anything turns up to make the beak want to get rid of it, I'll tell\r\nhim you're dead nuts on it. See?'\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight after this episode matters went on as before. Mrs\r\nWilliamson departed, thinking regretfully of the cat she had left\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\nCaptain Kettle died for his country with moderate regularity, and on\r\none occasion, when he attempted to extract some milk from the very\r\ncentre of a fag's tea-party, almost died for another reason. Then the\r\nend came suddenly.\r\n\r\nTrentham had been invited to supper one Sunday by Mr Prater. When he\r\narrived it became apparent to him that the atmosphere was one of\r\nsubdued gloom. At first he could not understand this, but soon the\r\nreason was made clear. Captain Kettle had, in the expressive language\r\nof the man in the street, been and gone and done it. He had been left\r\nalone that evening in the drawing-room, while the House was at church,\r\nand his eye, roaming restlessly about in search of evil to perform, had\r\nlighted upon a cage. In that cage was a special sort of canary, in its\r\nown line as accomplished an artiste as Captain Kettle himself. It sang\r\nwith taste and feeling, and made itself generally agreeable in a number\r\nof little ways. But to Captain Kettle it was merely a bird. One of the\r\npoets sings of an acquaintance of his who was so constituted that 'a\r\nprimrose by the river's brim a simple primrose was to him, and it was\r\nnothing more'. Just so with Captain Kettle. He was not the cat to make\r\nnice distinctions between birds. Like the cat in another poem, he only\r\nknew they made him light and salutary meals. So, with the exercise of\r\nconsiderable ingenuity, he extracted that canary from its cage and ate\r\nit. He was now in disgrace.\r\n\r\n'We shall have to get rid of him,' said Mr Prater.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid so,' said Mrs Prater.\r\n\r\n'If you weren't thinking of giving him to anyone in particular, sir,'\r\nsaid Trentham, 'my sister would be awfully glad to take him, I know.\r\nShe was very keen on him when she came to see me.'\r\n\r\n'That's excellent,' said Prater. 'I was afraid we should have to send\r\nhim to a home somewhere.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose we can't keep him after all?' suggested Mrs Prater.\r\n\r\nTrentham waited in suspense.\r\n\r\n'No,' said Prater, decidedly. 'I think _not_.' So Captain Kettle\r\nwent, and the House knew him no more, and the Tabby Terror was at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[12]\r\n\r\nTHE PRIZE POEM\r\n\r\n\r\nSome quarter of a century before the period with which this story\r\ndeals, a certain rich and misanthropic man was seized with a bright\r\nidea for perpetuating his memory after death, and at the same time\r\nharassing a certain section of mankind. So in his will he set aside a\r\nportion of his income to be spent on an annual prize for the best poem\r\nsubmitted by a member of the Sixth Form of St Austin's College, on a\r\nsubject to be selected by the Headmaster. And, he added--one seems to\r\nhear him chuckling to himself--every member of the form must compete.\r\nThen he died. But the evil that men do lives after them, and each year\r\nsaw a fresh band of unwilling bards goaded to despair by his bequest.\r\nTrue, there were always one or two who hailed this ready market for\r\ntheir sonnets and odes with joy. But the majority, being barely able to\r\nrhyme 'dove' with 'love', regarded the annual announcement of the\r\nsubject chosen with feelings of the deepest disgust.\r\n\r\nThe chains were thrown off after a period of twenty-seven years in this\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nReynolds of the Remove was indirectly the cause of the change. He was\r\nin the infirmary, convalescing after an attack of German measles, when\r\nhe received a visit from Smith, an ornament of the Sixth.\r\n\r\n'By Jove,' remarked that gentleman, gazing enviously round the\r\nsick-room, 'they seem to do you pretty well here.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, not bad, is it? Take a seat. Anything been happening lately?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing much. I suppose you know we beat the M.C.C. by a wicket?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, so I heard. Anything else?'\r\n\r\n'Prize poem,' said Smith, without enthusiasm. He was not a poet.\r\n\r\nReynolds became interested at once. If there was one role in which he\r\nfancied himself (and, indeed, there were a good many), it was that of a\r\nversifier. His great ambition was to see some of his lines in print,\r\nand he had contracted the habit of sending them up to various\r\nperiodicals, with no result, so far, except the arrival of rejected\r\nMSS. at meal-times in embarrassingly long envelopes. Which he\r\nblushingly concealed with all possible speed.\r\n\r\n'What's the subject this year?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'The College--of all idiotic things.'\r\n\r\n'Couldn't have a better subject for an ode. By Jove, I wish I was in\r\nthe Sixth.'\r\n\r\n'Wish I was in the infirmary,' said Smith.\r\n\r\nReynolds was struck with an idea.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Smith,' he said, 'if you like I'll do you a poem, and you\r\ncan send it up. If it gets the prize--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, it won't get the prize,' Smith put in eagerly. 'Rogers is a cert.\r\nfor that.'\r\n\r\n'If it gets the prize,' repeated Reynolds, with asperity, 'you'll have\r\nto tell the Old Man all about it. He'll probably curse a bit, but that\r\ncan't be helped. How's this for a beginning?\r\n\r\n    \"Imposing pile, reared up 'midst pleasant grounds,\r\n    The scene of many a battle, lost or won,\r\n    At cricket or at football; whose red walls\r\n    Full many a sun has kissed 'ere day is done.\"'\r\n\r\n'Grand. Couldn't you get in something about the M.C.C. match? You could\r\nmake cricket rhyme with wicket.' Smith sat entranced with his\r\ningenuity, but the other treated so material a suggestion with scorn.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Smith, 'I must be off now. We've got a House-match on.\r\nThanks awfully about the poem.'\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Reynolds set himself seriously to the composing of an\r\node that should do him justice. That is to say, he drew up a chair and\r\ntable to the open window, wrote down the lines he had already composed,\r\nand began chewing a pen. After a few minutes he wrote another four\r\nlines, crossed them out, and selected a fresh piece of paper. He then\r\ncopied out his first four lines again. After eating his pen to a stump,\r\nhe jotted down the two words 'boys' and 'joys' at the end of separate\r\nlines. This led him to select a third piece of paper, on which he\r\nproduced a sort of _edition de luxe_ in his best handwriting, with\r\nthe title 'Ode to the College' in printed letters at the top. He was\r\nadmiring the neat effect of this when the door opened suddenly and\r\nviolently, and Mrs Lee, a lady of advanced years and energetic habits,\r\nwhose duty it was to minister to the needs of the sick and wounded in\r\nthe infirmary, entered with his tea. Mrs Lee's method of entering a\r\nroom was in accordance with the advice of the Psalmist, where he says,\r\n'Fling wide the gates'. She flung wide the gate of the sick-room, and\r\nthe result was that what is commonly called 'a thorough draught' was\r\nestablished. The air was thick with flying papers, and when calm at\r\nlength succeeded storm, two editions of 'Ode to the College' were lying\r\non the grass outside.\r\n\r\nReynolds attacked the tea without attempting to retrieve his vanished\r\nwork. Poetry is good, but tea is better. Besides, he argued within\r\nhimself, he remembered all he had written, and could easily write it\r\nout again. So, as far as he was concerned, those three sheets of paper\r\nwere a closed book.\r\n\r\nLater on in the afternoon, Montgomery of the Sixth happened to be\r\npassing by the infirmary, when Fate, aided by a sudden gust of wind,\r\nblew a piece of paper at him. 'Great Scott,' he observed, as his eye\r\nfell on the words 'Ode to the College'. Montgomery, like Smith, was no\r\nexpert in poetry. He had spent a wretched afternoon trying to hammer\r\nout something that would pass muster in the poem competition, but\r\nwithout the least success. There were four lines on the paper. Two\r\nmore, and it would be a poem, and capable of being entered for the\r\nprize as such. The words 'imposing pile', with which the fragment in\r\nhis hand began, took his fancy immensely. A poetic afflatus seized him,\r\nand in less than three hours he had added the necessary couplet,\r\n\r\n    How truly sweet it is for such as me\r\n    To gaze on thee.\r\n\r\n'And dashed neat, too,' he said, with satisfaction, as he threw the\r\nmanuscript into his drawer. 'I don't know whether \"me\" shouldn't be\r\n\"I\", but they'll have to lump it. It's a poem, anyhow, within the\r\nmeaning of the act.' And he strolled off to a neighbour's study to\r\nborrow a book.\r\n\r\nTwo nights afterwards, Morrison, also of the Sixth, was enjoying his\r\nusual during prep siesta in his study. A tap at the door roused him.\r\nHastily seizing a lexicon, he assumed the attitude of the seeker after\r\nknowledge, and said, 'Come in.' It was not the House-master, but Evans,\r\nMorrison's fag, who entered with pride on his face and a piece of paper\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n'I say,' he began, 'you remember you told me to hunt up some tags for\r\nthe poem. Will this do?'\r\n\r\nMorrison took the paper with a judicial air. On it were the words:\r\n\r\n    Imposing pile, reared up 'midst pleasant grounds,\r\n    The scene of many a battle, lost or won,\r\n    At cricket or at football; whose red walls\r\n    Full many a sun has kissed 'ere day is done.\r\n\r\n'That's ripping, as far as it goes,' said Morrison. 'Couldn't be\r\nbetter. You'll find some apples in that box. Better take a few. But\r\nlook here,' with sudden suspicion, 'I don't believe you made all this\r\nup yourself. Did you?'\r\n\r\nEvans finished selecting his apples before venturing on a reply. Then\r\nhe blushed, as much as a member of the junior school is capable of\r\nblushing.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he said, 'I didn't exactly. You see, you only told me to get\r\nthe tags. You didn't say how.'\r\n\r\n'But how did you get hold of this? Whose is it?'\r\n\r\n'Dunno. I found it in the field between the Pavilion and the\r\ninfirmary.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! well, it doesn't matter much. They're just what I wanted, which is\r\nthe great thing. Thanks. Shut the door, will you?' Whereupon Evans\r\nretired, the richer by many apples, and Morrison resumed his siesta at\r\nthe point where he had left off.\r\n\r\n'Got that poem done yet?' said Smith to Reynolds, pouring out a cup of\r\ntea for the invalid on the following Sunday.\r\n\r\n'Two lumps, please. No, not quite.'\r\n\r\n'Great Caesar, man, when'll it be ready, do you think? It's got to go\r\nin tomorrow.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm really frightfully sorry, but I got hold of a grand book.\r\nEver read--?'\r\n\r\n'Isn't any of it done?' asked Smith.\r\n\r\n'Only the first verse, I'm afraid. But, look here, you aren't keen on\r\ngetting the prize. Why not send in only the one verse? It makes a\r\nfairly decent poem.'\r\n\r\n'Hum! Think the Old 'Un'll pass it?'\r\n\r\n'He'll have to. There's nothing in the rules about length. Here it is\r\nif you want it.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks. I suppose it'll be all right? So long! I must be off.'\r\n\r\nThe Headmaster, known to the world as the Rev. Arthur James Perceval,\r\nM.A., and to the School as the Old 'Un, was sitting at breakfast,\r\nstirring his coffee, with a look of marked perplexity upon his\r\ndignified face. This was not caused by the coffee, which was excellent,\r\nbut by a letter which he held in his left hand.\r\n\r\n'Hum!' he said. Then 'Umph!' in a protesting tone, as if someone had\r\npinched him. Finally, he gave vent to a long-drawn 'Um-m-m,' in a deep\r\nbass. 'Most extraordinary. Really, most extraordinary. Exceedingly.\r\nYes. Um. Very.' He took a sip of coffee.\r\n\r\n'My dear,' said he, suddenly. Mrs Perceval started violently. She had\r\nbeen sketching out in her mind a little dinner, and wondering whether\r\nthe cook would be equal to it.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she said.\r\n\r\n'My dear, this is a very extraordinary communication. Exceedingly so.\r\nYes, very.'\r\n\r\n'Who is it from?'\r\n\r\nMr Perceval shuddered. He was a purist in speech. '_From whom_,\r\nyou should say. It is from Mr Wells, a great College friend of mine.\r\nI--ah--submitted to him for examination the poems sent in for the Sixth\r\nForm Prize. He writes in a very flippant style. I must say, very\r\nflippant. This is his letter:--\"Dear Jimmy (really, really, he should\r\nremember that we are not so young as we were); dear--ahem--Jimmy. The\r\npoems to hand. I have read them, and am writing this from my sick-bed.\r\nThe doctor tells me I may pull through even yet. There was only one any\r\ngood at all, that was Rogers's, which, though--er--squiffy (tut!) in\r\nparts, was a long way better than any of the others. But the most\r\ntaking part of the whole programme was afforded by the three comedians,\r\nwhose efforts I enclose. You will notice that each begins with exactly\r\nthe same four lines. Of course, I deprecate cribbing, but you really\r\ncan't help admiring this sort of thing. There is a reckless daring\r\nabout it which is simply fascinating. A horrible thought--have they\r\nbeen pulling your dignified leg? By the way, do you remember\"--the rest\r\nof the letter is--er--on different matters.'\r\n\r\n'James! How extraordinary!'\r\n\r\n'Um, yes. I am reluctant to suspect--er--collusion, but really here\r\nthere can be no doubt. No doubt at all. No.'\r\n\r\n'Unless,' began Mrs Perceval, tentatively. 'No doubt at all, my dear,'\r\nsnapped Reverend Jimmy. He did not wish to recall the other\r\npossibility, that his dignified leg was being pulled.\r\n\r\n'Now, for what purpose did I summon you three boys?' asked Mr Perceval,\r\nof Smith, Montgomery, and Morrison, in his room after morning school\r\nthat day. He generally began a painful interview with this question.\r\nThe method had distinct advantages. If the criminal were of a nervous\r\ndisposition, he would give himself away upon the instant. In any case,\r\nit was likely to startle him. 'For what purpose?' repeated the\r\nHeadmaster, fixing Smith with a glittering eye.\r\n\r\n'I will tell you,' continued Mr Perceval. 'It was because I desired\r\ninformation, which none but you can supply. How comes it that each of\r\nyour compositions for the Poetry Prize commences with the same four\r\nlines?' The three poets looked at one another in speechless\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n'Here,' he resumed, 'are the three papers. Compare them. Now,'--after\r\nthe inspection was over--' what explanation have you to offer? Smith,\r\nare these your lines?'\r\n\r\n'I--er--ah--_wrote_ them, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Don't prevaricate, Smith. Are you the author of those lines?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! Very good. Are you, Montgomery?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Very good. Then you, Morrison, are exonerated from all blame. You have\r\nbeen exceedingly badly treated. The first-fruit of your brain has\r\nbeen--ah--plucked by others, who toiled not neither did they spin. You\r\ncan go, Morrison.'\r\n\r\n'But, sir--'\r\n\r\n'Well, Morrison?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't write them, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I--ah--don't quite understand you, Morrison. You say that you are\r\nindebted to another for these lines?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'To Smith?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'To Montgomery?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Then, Morrison, may I ask to whom you are indebted?'\r\n\r\n'I found them in the field on a piece of paper, sir.' He claimed the\r\ndiscovery himself, because he thought that Evans might possibly prefer\r\nto remain outside this tangle.\r\n\r\n'So did I, sir.' This from Montgomery. Mr Perceval looked bewildered,\r\nas indeed he was.\r\n\r\n'And did you, Smith, also find this poem on a piece of paper in the\r\nfield?' There was a metallic ring of sarcasm in his voice.\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! Then to what circumstance were you indebted for the lines?'\r\n\r\n'I got Reynolds to do them for me, sir.'\r\n\r\nMontgomery spoke. 'It was near the infirmary that I found the paper,\r\nand Reynolds is in there.'\r\n\r\n'So did I, sir,' said Morrison, incoherently.\r\n\r\n'Then am I to understand, Smith, that to gain the prize you resorted to\r\nsuch underhand means as this?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir, we agreed that there was no danger of my getting the prize.\r\nIf I had got it, I should have told you everything. Reynolds will tell\r\nyou that, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Then what object had you in pursuing this deception?'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir, the rules say everyone must send in something, and I can't\r\nwrite poetry at all, and Reynolds likes it, so I asked him to do it.'\r\n\r\nAnd Smith waited for the storm to burst. But it did not burst. Far down\r\nin Mr Perceval's system lurked a quiet sense of humour. The situation\r\npenetrated to it. Then he remembered the examiner's letter, and it\r\ndawned upon him that there are few crueller things than to make a\r\nprosaic person write poetry.\r\n\r\n'You may go,' he said, and the three went.\r\n\r\nAnd at the next Board Meeting it was decided, mainly owing to the\r\ninfluence of an exceedingly eloquent speech from the Headmaster, to\r\nalter the rules for the Sixth Form Poetry Prize, so that from thence\r\nonward no one need compete unless he felt himself filled with the\r\nimmortal fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[13]\r\n\r\nWORK\r\n\r\n\r\n    With a pleasure that's emphatic\r\n    We retire to our attic\r\n    With the satisfying feeling that our duty has been done.\r\n\r\n    Oh! philosophers may sing\r\n    Of the troubles of a king\r\n    But of pleasures there are many and of troubles there are none,\r\n    And the culminating pleasure\r\n    Which we treasure beyond measure\r\n    Is the satisfying feeling that our duty has been done.\r\n\r\n                                           _W. S. Gilbert_\r\n\r\nWork is supposed to be the centre round which school life revolves--the\r\nhub of the school wheel, the lode-star of the schoolboy's existence,\r\nand a great many other things. 'You come to school to work', is the\r\nformula used by masters when sentencing a victim to the wailing and\r\ngnashing of teeth provided by two hours' extra tuition on a hot\r\nafternoon. In this, I think, they err, and my opinion is backed up by\r\nnumerous scholars of my acquaintance, who have even gone so far--on\r\noccasions when they themselves have been the victims--as to express\r\npositive disapproval of the existing state of things. In the dear, dead\r\ndays (beyond recall), I used often to long to put the case to my\r\nform-master in its only fair aspect, but always refrained from motives\r\nof policy. Masters are so apt to take offence at the well-meant\r\nendeavours of their form to instruct them in the way they should go.\r\n\r\nWhat I should have liked to have done would have been something after\r\nthis fashion. Entering the sanctum of the Headmaster, I should have\r\nmotioned him to his seat--if he were seated already, have assured him\r\nthat to rise was unnecessary. I should then have taken a seat myself,\r\ntaking care to preserve a calm fixity of demeanour, and finally, with a\r\npreliminary cough, I should have embarked upon the following moving\r\naddress: 'My dear sir, my dear Reverend Jones or Brown (as the case may\r\nbe), believe me when I say that your whole system of work is founded on\r\na fallacious dream and reeks of rottenness. No, no, I beg that you will\r\nnot interrupt me. The real state of the case, if I may say so, is\r\nbriefly this: a boy goes to school to enjoy himself, and, on arriving,\r\nfinds to his consternation that a great deal more work is expected of\r\nhim than he is prepared to do. What course, then, Reverend Jones or\r\nBrown, does he take? He proceeds to do as much work as will steer him\r\nsafely between the, ah--I may say, the Scylla of punishment and the\r\nCharybdis of being considered what my, er--fellow-pupils euphoniously\r\nterm a swot. That, I think, is all this morning. _Good_ day. Pray\r\ndo not trouble to rise. I will find my way out.' I should then have\r\nmade for the door, locked it, if possible, on the outside, and, rushing\r\nto the railway station, have taken a through ticket to Spitzbergen or\r\nsome other place where Extradition treaties do not hold good.\r\n\r\nBut 'twas not mine to play the Tib. Gracchus, to emulate the O.\r\nCromwell. So far from pouring my opinions like so much boiling oil into\r\nthe ear of my task-master, I was content to play the part of audience\r\nwhile _he_ did the talking, my sole remark being 'Yes'r' at fixed\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I knew that I was in the right. My bosom throbbed with the\r\njustice of my cause. For why? The ambition of every human new boy\r\nis surely to become like J. Essop of the First Eleven, who can hit a\r\nball over two ponds, a wood, and seven villages, rather than to\r\nresemble that pale young student, Mill-Stuart, who, though he can\r\nspeak Sanskrit like a native of Sanskritia, couldn't score a single\r\noff a slow long-hop.\r\n\r\nAnd this ambition is a laudable one. For the athlete is the product of\r\nnature--a step towards the more perfect type of animal, while the\r\nscholar is the outcome of artificiality. What, I ask, does the scholar\r\ngain, either morally or physically, or in any other way, by knowing who\r\nwas tribune of the people in 284 BC or what is the precise difference\r\nbetween the various constructions of _cum_? It is not as if\r\nignorance of the tribune's identity caused him any mental unrest. In\r\nshort, what excuse is there for the student? 'None,' shrieks Echo\r\nenthusiastically. 'None whatever.'\r\n\r\nOur children are being led to ruin by this system. They will become\r\ndons and think in Greek. The victim of the craze stops at nothing. He\r\npuns in Latin. He quips and quirks in Ionic and Doric. In the worst\r\nstages of the disease he will edit Greek plays and say that Merry quite\r\nmisses the fun of the passage, or that Jebb is mediocre. Think, I beg\r\nof you, paterfamilias, and you, mater ditto, what your feelings would\r\nbe were you to find Henry or Archibald Cuthbert correcting proofs of\r\n_The Agamemnon_, and inventing 'nasty ones' for Mr Sidgwick! Very\r\nwell then. Be warned.\r\n\r\nOur bright-eyed lads are taught insane constructions in Greek and Latin\r\nfrom morning till night, and they come for their holidays, in many\r\ncases, without the merest foundation of a batting style. Ask them what\r\na Yorker is, and they will say: 'A man from York, though I presume you\r\nmean a Yorkshireman.' They will read Herodotus without a dictionary for\r\npleasure, but ask them to translate the childishly simple sentence:\r\n'Trott was soon in his timber-yard with a length 'un that whipped\r\nacross from the off,' and they'll shrink abashed and swear they have\r\nnot skill at that, as Gilbert says.\r\n\r\nThe papers sometimes contain humorous forecasts of future education,\r\nwhen cricket and football shall come to their own. They little know the\r\nexcellence of the thing they mock at. When we get schools that teach\r\nnothing but games, then will the sun definitely refuse to set on the\r\nroast beef of old England. May it be soon. Some day, mayhap, I shall\r\ngather my great-great-grandsons round my knee, and tell them--as one\r\ntells tales of Faery--that I can remember the time when Work was\r\nconsidered the be-all and the end-all of a school career. Perchance,\r\nwhen my great-great-grandson John (called John after the famous Jones\r\nof that name) has brought home the prize for English Essay on 'Rugby\r\n_v._ Association', I shall pat his head (gently) and the tears\r\nwill come to my old eyes as I recall the time when I, too, might have\r\nwon a prize--for that obsolete subject, Latin Prose--and was only\r\nprevented by the superior excellence of my thirty-and-one fellow\r\nstudents, coupled, indeed, with my own inability to conjugate\r\n_sum._\r\n\r\nSuch days, I say, may come. But now are the Dark Ages. The only thing\r\nthat can possibly make Work anything but an unmitigated nuisance is the\r\nprospect of a 'Varsity scholarship, and the thought that, in the event\r\nof failure, a 'Varsity career will be out of the question.\r\n\r\nWith this thought constantly before him, the student can put a certain\r\namount of enthusiasm into his work, and even go to the length of rising\r\nat five o'clock o' mornings to drink yet deeper of the cup of\r\nknowledge. I have done it myself. 'Varsity means games and yellow\r\nwaistcoats and Proctors, and that sort of thing. It is worth working\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nBut for the unfortunate individual who is barred by circumstances from\r\nparticipating in these joys, what inducement is there to work? Is such\r\na one to leave the school nets in order to stew in a stuffy room over a\r\nThucydides? I trow not.\r\n\r\nChapter one of my great forthcoming work, _The Compleat Slacker_,\r\ncontains minute instructions on the art of avoiding preparation from\r\nbeginning to end of term. Foremost among the words of advice ranks this\r\nmaxim: Get an official list of the books you are to do, and examine\r\nthem carefully with a view to seeing what it is possible to do unseen.\r\nThus, if Virgil is among these authors, you can rely on being able to\r\ndo him with success. People who ought to know better will tell you that\r\nVirgil is hard. Such a shallow falsehood needs little comment. A\r\nscholar who cannot translate ten lines of _The Aeneid_ between the\r\ntime he is put on and the time he begins to speak is unworthy of pity\r\nor consideration, and if I meet him in the street I shall assuredly cut\r\nhim. Aeschylus, on the other hand, is a demon, and needs careful\r\nwatching, though in an emergency you can always say the reading is\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nSometimes the compleat slacker falls into a trap. The saddest case I\r\ncan remember is that of poor Charles Vanderpoop. He was a bright young\r\nlad, and showed some promise of rising to heights as a slacker. He fell\r\nin this fashion. One Easter term his form had half-finished a speech of\r\nDemosthenes, and the form-master gave them to understand that they\r\nwould absorb the rest during the forthcoming term. Charles, being\r\nnaturally anxious to do as little work as possible during the summer\r\nmonths, spent his Easter holidays carefully preparing this speech, so\r\nas to have it ready in advance. What was his horror, on returning to\r\nSchool at the appointed date, to find that they were going to throw\r\nDemosthenes over altogether, and patronize Plato. Threats, entreaties,\r\nprayers--all were accounted nothing by the master who had led him into\r\nthis morass of troubles. It is believed that the shock destroyed his\r\nreason. At any rate, the fact remains that that term (the summer term,\r\nmark you) he won two prizes. In the following term he won three. To\r\nrecapitulate his outrages from that time to the present were a\r\nharrowing and unnecessary task. Suffice it that he is now a Regius\r\nProfessor, and I saw in the papers a short time ago that a lecture of\r\nhis on 'The Probable Origin of the Greek Negative', created quite a\r\n_furore_. If this is not Tragedy with a big T, I should like to\r\nknow what it is.\r\n\r\nAs an exciting pastime, unseen translation must rank very high.\r\nEveryone who has ever tried translating unseen must acknowledge that\r\nall other forms of excitement seem but feeble makeshifts after it. I\r\nhave, in the course of a career of sustained usefulness to the human\r\nrace, had my share of thrills. I have asked a strong and busy porter,\r\nat Paddington, when the Brighton train started. I have gone for the\r\nbroad-jump record in trying to avoid a motor-car. I have played\r\nSpillikins and Ping-Pong. But never again have I felt the excitement\r\nthat used to wander athwart my moral backbone when I was put on to\r\ntranslate a passage containing a notorious _crux_ and seventeen\r\ndoubtful readings, with only that innate genius, which is the wonder of\r\nthe civilized world, to pull me through. And what a glow of pride one\r\nfeels when it is all over; when one has made a glorious, golden guess\r\nat the _crux_, and trampled the doubtful readings under foot with\r\ninspired ease. It is like a day at the seaside.\r\n\r\nWork is bad enough, but Examinations are worse, especially the Board\r\nExaminations. By doing from ten to twenty minutes prep every night, the\r\ncompleat slacker could get through most of the term with average\r\nsuccess. Then came the Examinations. The dabbler in unseen translations\r\nfound himself caught as in a snare. Gone was the peaceful security in\r\nwhich he had lulled to rest all the well-meant efforts of his guardian\r\nangel to rouse him to a sense of his duties. There, right in front of\r\nhim, yawned the abyss of Retribution.\r\n\r\nAlas! poor slacker. I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of\r\nmost excellent fancy. Where be his gibes now? How is he to cope with\r\nthe fiendish ingenuity of the examiners? How is he to master the\r\ncontents of a book of Thucydides in a couple of days? It is a fearsome\r\nproblem. Perhaps he will get up in the small hours and work by candle\r\nlight from two till eight o'clock. In this case he will start his day a\r\nmental and physical wreck. Perhaps he will try to work and be led away\r\nby the love of light reading.\r\n\r\nIn any case he will fail to obtain enough marks to satisfy the\r\nexaminers, though whether examiners ever are satisfied, except by Harry\r\nthe hero of the school story (Every Lad's Library, uniform edition, 2s\r\n6d), is rather a doubtful question.\r\n\r\nIn such straits, matters resolve themselves into a sort of drama with\r\nthree characters. We will call our hero Smith.\r\n\r\n_Scene:_ a Study\r\n\r\n_Dramatis Personae:_\r\n            SMITH\r\n            CONSCIENCE\r\n            MEPHISTOPHELES\r\n\r\n_Enter_ SMITH (_down centre_)\r\n\r\n_He seats himself at table and opens a Thucydides._\r\n\r\n_Enter_ CONSCIENCE _through ceiling_ (R.), MEPHISTOPHELES\r\n_through floor_ (L.).\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE (_with a kindly smile_): Precisely what I was about to\r\nremark, my dear lad. A little Thucydides would be a very good thing.\r\nThucydides, as you doubtless know, was a very famous Athenian\r\nhistorian. Date?\r\n\r\nSMITH: Er--um--let me see.\r\n\r\nMEPH. (_aside_): Look in the Introduction and pretend you did it\r\nby accident.\r\n\r\nSMITH (_having done so_): 431 B.C. _circ_.\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE _wipes away a tear_.\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE: Thucydides made himself a thorough master of the concisest\r\nof styles.\r\n\r\nMEPH.: And in doing so became infernally obscure. Excuse shop.\r\n\r\nSMITH (_gloomily_): Hum!\r\n\r\nMEPH. (_sneeringly_): Ha!\r\n\r\n_Long pause_.\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE (_gently_): Do you not think, my dear lad, that you had\r\nbetter begin? Time and tide, as you are aware, wait for no man. And--\r\n\r\nSMITH: Yes?\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE: You have not, I fear, a very firm grasp of the subject.\r\nHowever, if you work hard till eleven--\r\n\r\nSMITH (_gloomily_): Hum! Three hours!\r\n\r\nMEPH. (_cheerily_): Exactly so. Three hours. A little more if\r\nanything. By the way, excuse me asking, but have you prepared the\r\nsubject thoroughly during the term?\r\n\r\nSMITH: My _dear_ sir! Of _course!_\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE (_reprovingly_):???!!??!\r\n\r\nSMITH: Well, perhaps, not quite so much as I might have done. Such a\r\nlot of things to do this term. Cricket, for instance.\r\n\r\nMEPH.: Rather. Talking of cricket, you seemed to be shaping rather well\r\nlast Saturday. I had just run up on business, and someone told me you\r\nmade eighty not out. Get your century all right?\r\n\r\nSMITH (_brightening at the recollection_): Just a bit--117 not\r\nout. I hit--but perhaps you've heard?\r\n\r\nMEPH.: Not at all, not at all. Let's hear all about it.\r\n\r\n_CONSCIENCE seeks to interpose, but is prevented by MEPH., who eggs\r\nSMITH on to talk cricket for over an hour._\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE _(at last; in an acid voice)_: That is a history of the\r\nPeloponnesian War by Thucydides on the table in front of you. I thought\r\nI would mention it, in case you had forgotten.\r\n\r\nSMITH: Great Scott, yes! Here, I say, I must start.\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE: Hear! Hear!\r\n\r\nMEPH. _(insinuatingly)_: One moment. Did you say you _had_\r\nprepared this book during the term? Afraid I'm a little hard of\r\nhearing. Eh, what?\r\n\r\nSMITH: Well--er--no, I have not. Have you ever played billiards with a\r\nwalking-stick and five balls?\r\n\r\nMEPH.: Quite so, quite so. I quite understand. Don't you distress\r\nyourself, old chap. You obviously can't get through a whole book of\r\nThucydides in under two hours, can you?\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE _(severely)_: He might, by attentive application to\r\nstudy, master a considerable portion of the historian's _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ in that time.\r\n\r\nMEPH.: Yes, and find that not one of the passages he had prepared was\r\nset in the paper.\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE: At the least, he would, if he were to pursue the course\r\nwhich I have indicated, greatly benefit his mind.\r\n\r\nMEPH. _gives a short, derisive laugh. Long pause._\r\n\r\nMEPH. _(looking towards bookshelf)_: Hullo, you've got a decent\r\nlot of books, pommy word you have. _Rodney Stone, Vice Versa, Many\r\nCargoes._ Ripping. Ever read _Many Cargoes?_\r\n\r\nCONSCIENCE _(glancing at his watch)_: I am sorry, but I must\r\nreally go now. I will see you some other day.\r\n\r\n_Exit sorrowfully._\r\n\r\nMEPH.: Well, thank goodness _he's_ gone. Never saw such a fearful\r\nold bore in my life. Can't think why you let him hang on to you so. We\r\nmay as well make a night of it now, eh? No use your trying to work at\r\nthis time of night.\r\n\r\nSMITH: Not a bit.\r\n\r\nMEPH.: Did you say you'd not read _Many Cargoes?_\r\n\r\nSMITH: Never. Only got it today. Good?\r\n\r\nMEPH.: Simply ripping. All short stories. Make you yell.\r\n\r\nSMITH _(with a last effort)_: But don't you think--\r\n\r\nMEPH.: Oh no. Besides, you can easily get up early tomorrow for the\r\nThucydides.\r\n\r\nSMITH: Of course I can. Never thought of that. Heave us _Many\r\nCargoes._ Thanks.\r\n\r\n_Begins to read. MEPH. grins fiendishly, and vanishes through floor\r\nenveloped in red flame. Sobbing heard from the direction of the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nScene closes._\r\n\r\nNext morning, of course, he will oversleep himself, and his Thucydides\r\npaper will be of such a calibre that that eminent historian will writhe\r\nin his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[14]\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of all forms of lettered effusiveness, that which exploits the\r\n    original work of others and professes to supply us with right\r\n    opinions thereanent is the least wanted.\r\n\r\n                                     _Kenneth Grahame_\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me one of the worst flaws in our mistaken\r\nsocial system, that absolutely no distinction is made between the\r\nmaster who forces the human boy to take down notes from dictation and\r\nthe rest of mankind. I mean that, if in a moment of righteous\r\nindignation you rend such a one limb from limb, you will almost\r\ncertainly be subjected to the utmost rigour of the law, and you will be\r\nlucky if you escape a heavy fine of five or ten shillings, exclusive of\r\nthe costs of the case. Now, this is not right on the face of it. It is\r\neven wrong. The law should take into account the extreme provocation\r\nwhich led to the action. Punish if you will the man who travels\r\nsecond-class with a third-class ticket, or who borrows a pencil and\r\nforgets to return it; but there are occasions when justice should be\r\ntempered with mercy, and this murdering of pedagogues is undoubtedly\r\nsuch an occasion.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, however, that there are two varieties of\r\nnotes. The printed notes at the end of your Thucydides or Homer are\r\ndistinctly useful when they aim at acting up to their true vocation,\r\nnamely, the translating of difficult passages or words. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the author will insist on airing his scholarship, and instead\r\nof translations he supplies parallel passages, which neither interest,\r\nelevate, nor amuse the reader. This, of course, is mere vanity. The\r\nauthor, sitting in his comfortable chair with something short within\r\neasy reach, recks nothing of the misery he is inflicting on hundreds of\r\npeople who have done him no harm at all. He turns over the pages of his\r\nbook of _Familiar Quotations_ with brutal callousness, and for\r\nevery tricky passage in the work which he is editing, finds and makes a\r\nnote of three or four even trickier ones from other works. Who has not\r\nin his time been brought face to face with a word which defies\r\ntranslation? There are two courses open to you on such an occasion, to\r\nlook the word up in the lexicon, or in the notes. You, of course, turn\r\nup the notes, and find: 'See line 80.' You look up line 80, hoping to\r\nsee a translation, and there you are told that a rather similar\r\nconstruction occurs in Xenophades' _Lyrics from a Padded Cell_. On\r\nthis, the craven of spirit will resort to the lexicon, but the man of\r\nmettle will close his book with an emphatic bang, and refuse to have\r\nanything more to do with it. Of a different sort are the notes which\r\nsimply translate the difficulty and subside. These are a boon to the\r\nscholar. Without them it would be almost impossible to prepare one's\r\nwork during school, and we should be reduced to the prosaic expedient\r\nof working in prep. time. What we want is the commentator who\r\ntranslates _mensa_ as 'a table' without giving a page and a half\r\nof notes on the uses of the table in ancient Greece, with an excursus\r\non the habit common in those times of retiring underneath it after\r\ndinner, and a list of the passages in Apollonius Rhodius where the word\r\n'table' is mentioned.\r\n\r\nThese voluminous notes are apt to prove a nuisance in more ways than\r\none. Your average master is generally inordinately fond of them, and\r\nwill frequently ask some member of the form to read his note on\r\nso-and-so out to his fellows. This sometimes leads to curious results,\r\nas it is hardly to be expected that the youth called upon will be\r\nattending, even if he is awake, which is unlikely. On one occasion\r\nan acquaintance of mine, 'whose name I am not at liberty to divulge',\r\nwas suddenly aware that he was being addressed, and, on giving the\r\nmatter his attention, found that it was the form-master asking him to\r\nread out his note on _Balbus murum aedificavit_. My friend is a\r\nkind-hearted youth and of an obliging disposition, and would willingly\r\nhave done what was asked of him, but there were obstacles, first and\r\nforemost of which ranked the fact that, taking advantage of his\r\nposition on the back desk (whither he thought the basilisk eye of\r\nAuthority could not reach), he had substituted _Bab Ballads_ for\r\nthe words of Virgil, and was engrossed in the contents of that modern\r\nclassic. The subsequent explanations lasted several hours. In fact, it\r\nis probable that the master does not understand the facts of the case\r\nthoroughly even now. It is true that he called him a 'loathsome, slimy,\r\nrepulsive toad', but even this seems to fall short of the grandeur of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nThose notes, also, which are, alas! only too common nowadays, that deal\r\nwith peculiarities of grammar, how supremely repulsive they are! It is\r\nimpossible to glean any sense from them, as the Editor mixes up\r\nNipperwick's view with Sidgeley's reasoning and Spreckendzedeutscheim's\r\nsurmise with Donnerundblitzendorf's conjecture in a way that seems to\r\nargue a thorough unsoundness of mind and morals, a cynical insanity\r\ncombined with a blatant indecency. He occasionally starts in a\r\nreasonable manner by giving one view as (1) and the next as (2). So far\r\neveryone is happy and satisfied. The trouble commences when he has\r\noccasion to refer back to some former view, when he will say: 'Thus we\r\nsee (1) and (14) that,' etc. The unlucky student puts a finger on the\r\npage to keep the place, and hunts up view one. Having found this, and\r\nmarked the spot with another finger, he proceeds to look up view\r\nfourteen. He places another finger on this, and reads on, as follows:\r\n'Zmpe, however, maintains that Schrumpff (see 3) is practically insane,\r\nthat Spleckzh (see 34) is only a little better, and that Rswkg (see 97\r\na (b) C3) is so far from being right that his views may be dismissed as\r\nreadily as those of Xkryt (see 5x).' At this point brain-fever sets in,\r\nthe victim's last coherent thought being a passionate wish for more\r\nfingers. A friend of mine who was the wonder of all who knew him, in\r\nthat he was known to have scored ten per cent in one of these papers on\r\nquestions like the above, once divulged to an interviewer the fact that\r\nhe owed his success to his methods of learning rather than to his\r\nability. On the night before an exam, he would retire to some secret,\r\nsolitary place, such as the boot-room, and commence learning these\r\nnotes by heart. This, though a formidable task, was not so bad as the\r\nother alternative. The result was that, although in the majority of\r\ncases he would put down for one question an answer that would have been\r\nright for another, yet occasionally, luck being with him, he would hit\r\nthe mark. Hence his ten per cent.\r\n\r\nAnother fruitful source of discomfort is provided by the type of master\r\nwho lectures on a subject for half an hour, and then, with a bland\r\nsmile, invites, or rather challenges, his form to write a 'good, long\r\nnote' on the quintessence of his discourse. For the inexperienced this\r\nis an awful moment. They must write something--but what? For the last\r\nhalf hour they have been trying to impress the master with the fact\r\nthat they belong to the class of people who can always listen best with\r\ntheir eyes closed. Nor poppy, nor mandragora, nor all the drowsy syrups\r\nof the world can ever medicine them to that sweet sleep that they have\r\njust been enjoying. And now they must write a 'good, long note'. It is\r\nin such extremities that your veteran shows up well. He does not betray\r\nany discomfort. Not he. He rather enjoys the prospect, in fact, of\r\nbeing permitted to place the master's golden eloquence on paper. So he\r\ntakes up his pen with alacrity. No need to think what to write. He\r\nembarks on an essay concerning the master, showing up all his flaws in\r\na pitiless light, and analysing his thorough worthlessness of\r\ncharacter. On so congenial a subject he can, of course, write reams,\r\nand as the master seldom, if ever, desires to read the 'good, long\r\nnote', he acquires a well-earned reputation for attending in school and\r\nbeing able to express himself readily with his pen. _Vivat\r\nfloreatque_.\r\n\r\nBut all these forms of notes are as nothing compared with the notes\r\nthat youths even in this our boasted land of freedom are forced to take\r\ndown from dictation. Of the 'good, long note' your French scholar might\r\nwell remark: '_C'est terrible_', but justice would compel him to\r\nadd, as he thought of the dictation note: '_mais ce n'est pas le\r\ndiable_'. For these notes from dictation are, especially on a warm\r\nday, indubitably _le diable_.\r\n\r\nSuch notes are always dictated so rapidly that it is impossible to do\r\nanything towards understanding them as you go. You have to write your\r\nhardest to keep up. The beauty of this, from one point of view, is\r\nthat, if you miss a sentence, you have lost the thread of the whole\r\nthing, and it is useless to attempt to take it up again at once. The\r\nonly plan is to wait for some perceptible break in the flow of words,\r\nand dash in like lightning. It is much the same sort of thing as\r\nboarding a bus when in motion. And so you can take a long rest,\r\nprovided you are in an obscure part of the room. In passing, I might\r\nadd that a very pleasing indoor game can be played by asking the\r\nmaster, 'what came after so-and-so?' mentioning a point of the oration\r\nsome half-hour back. This always provides a respite of a few minutes\r\nwhile he is thinking of some bitter repartee worthy of the occasion,\r\nand if repeated several times during an afternoon may cause much\r\ninnocent merriment.\r\n\r\nOf course, the real venom that lurks hid within notes from dictation\r\ndoes not appear until the time for examination arrives. Then you find\r\nyourself face to face with sixty or seventy closely and badly written\r\npages of a note-book, all of which must be learnt by heart if you would\r\naspire to the dizzy heights of half-marks. It is useless to tell your\r\nexaminer that you had no chance of getting up the subject. 'Why,' he\r\nwill reply, 'I gave you notes on that very thing myself.' 'You did,\r\nsir,' you say, as you advance stealthily upon him, 'but as you dictated\r\nthose notes at the rate of two hundred words a minute, and as my brain,\r\nthough large, is not capable of absorbing sixty pages of a note-book in\r\none night, how the suggestively asterisked aposiopesis do you expect me\r\nto know them? Ah-h-h!' The last word is a war-cry, as you fling\r\nyourself bodily on him, and tear him courteously, but firmly, into\r\nminute fragments. Experience, which, as we all know, teaches, will in\r\ntime lead you into adopting some method by which you may evade this\r\ntaking of notes. A good plan is to occupy yourself with the composition\r\nof a journal, an unofficial magazine not intended for the eyes of the\r\nprofane, but confined rigidly to your own circle of acquaintances. The\r\nchief advantage of such a work is that you will continue to write while\r\nthe notes are being dictated. To throw your pen down with an air of\r\nfinality and begin reading some congenial work of fiction would be a\r\ngallant action, but impolitic. No, writing of some sort is essential,\r\nand as it is out of the question to take down the notes, what better\r\nsubstitute than an unofficial journal could be found? To one whose\r\ncontributions to the School magazine are constantly being cut down to\r\nmere skeletons by the hands of censors, there is a rapture otherwise\r\nunattainable in a page of really scurrilous items about those in\r\nauthority. Try it yourselves, my beamish lads. Think of something\r\nreally bad about somebody. Write it down and gloat over it. Sometimes,\r\nindeed, it is of the utmost use in determining your future career. You\r\nwill probably remember those Titanic articles that appeared at the\r\nbeginning of the war in _The Weekly Luggage-Train_, dealing with\r\nall the crimes of the War Office--the generals, the soldiers, the\r\nenemy--of everybody, in fact, except the editor, staff and office-boy\r\nof _The W.L.T._ Well, the writer of those epoch-making articles\r\nconfesses that he owes all his skill to his early training, when, a\r\nhappy lad at his little desk in school, he used to write trenchantly in\r\nhis note-book on the subject of the authorities. There is an example\r\nfor you. Of course we can never be like him, but let, oh! let us be as\r\nlike him as we're able to be. A final word to those lost ones who\r\ndictate the notes. Why are our ears so constantly assailed with\r\nunnecessary explanations of, and opinions on, English literature? Prey\r\nupon the Classics if you will. It is a revolting habit, but too common\r\nto excite overmuch horror. But surely anybody, presupposing a certain\r\nbias towards sanity, can understand the Classics of our own language,\r\nwith the exception, of course, of Browning. Take Tennyson, for example.\r\nHow often have we been forced to take down from dictation the miserable\r\nmaunderings of some commentator on the subject of _Maud_. A person\r\nreads _Maud_, and either likes it or dislikes it. In any case his\r\nopinion is not likely to be influenced by writing down at express speed\r\nthe opinions of somebody else concerning the methods or objectivity and\r\nsubjectivity of the author when he produced the work.\r\n\r\nSomebody told me a short time ago that Shelley was an example of\r\nsupreme, divine, superhuman genius. It is the sort of thing Mr\r\nGilbert's 'rapturous maidens' might have said: 'How Botticellian! How\r\nFra Angelican! How perceptively intense and consummately utter!' There\r\nis really no material difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[15]\r\n\r\nNOW, TALKING ABOUT CRICKET--\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of yore, when these white hairs were brown--or was it\r\nblack? At any rate, they were not white--and I was at school, it was\r\nalways my custom, when Fate obliged me to walk to school with a casual\r\nacquaintance, to whom I could not unburden my soul of those profound\r\nthoughts which even then occupied my mind, to turn the struggling\r\nconversation to the relative merits of cricket and football.\r\n\r\n'Do you like cricket better than footer?' was my formula. Now, though\r\nat the time, in order to save fruitless argument, I always agreed with\r\nmy companion, and praised the game he praised, in the innermost depths\r\nof my sub-consciousness, cricket ranked a long way in front of all\r\nother forms of sport. I may be wrong. More than once in my career it\r\nhas been represented to me that I couldn't play cricket for nuts. My\r\ncaptain said as much when I ran him out in _the_ match of the\r\nseason after he had made forty-nine and looked like stopping. A bowling\r\nacquaintance heartily endorsed his opinion on the occasion of my\r\nmissing three catches off him in one over. This, however, I attribute\r\nto prejudice, for the man I missed ultimately reached his century,\r\nmainly off the deliveries of my bowling acquaintance. I pointed out to\r\nhim that, had I accepted any one of the three chances, we should have\r\nmissed seeing the prettiest century made on the ground that season; but\r\nhe was one of those bowlers who sacrifice all that is beautiful in the\r\ngame to mere wickets. A sordid practice.\r\n\r\nLater on, the persistence with which my county ignored my claims to\r\ninclusion in the team, convinced me that I must leave cricket fame to\r\nothers. True, I did figure, rather prominently, too, in one county\r\nmatch. It was at the Oval, Surrey _v_. Middlesex. How well I\r\nremember that occasion! Albert Trott was bowling (Bertie we used to\r\ncall him); I forget who was batting. Suddenly the ball came soaring in\r\nmy direction. I was not nervous. I put down the sandwich I was eating,\r\nrose from my seat, picked the ball up neatly, and returned it with\r\nunerring aim to a fieldsman who was waiting for it with becoming\r\ndeference. Thunders of applause went up from the crowded ring.\r\n\r\nThat was the highest point I ever reached in practical cricket. But, as\r\nthe historian says of Mr Winkle, a man may be an excellent sportsman in\r\ntheory, even if he fail in practice. That's me. Reader (if any), have\r\nyou ever played cricket in the passage outside your study with a\r\nwalking-stick and a ball of paper? That's the game, my boy, for testing\r\nyour skill of wrist and eye. A century _v_. the M.C.C. is well\r\nenough in its way, but give me the man who can watch 'em in a narrow\r\npassage, lit only by a flickering gas-jet--one for every hit, four if\r\nit reaches the end, and six if it goes downstairs full-pitch, any pace\r\nbowling allowed. To make double figures in such a match is to taste\r\nlife. Only you had better do your tasting when the House-master is out\r\nfor the evening.\r\n\r\nI like to watch the young cricket idea shooting. I refer to the lower\r\ngames, where 'next man in' umpires with his pads on, his loins girt,\r\nand a bat in his hand. Many people have wondered why it is that no\r\nbudding umpire can officiate unless he holds a bat. For my part, I\r\nthink there is little foundation for the theory that it is part of a\r\nsemi-religious rite, on the analogy of the Freemasons' special\r\nhandshake and the like. Nor do I altogether agree with the authorities\r\nwho allege that man, when standing up, needs something as a prop or\r\nsupport. There is a shadow of reason, I grant, in this supposition, but\r\nafter years of keen observation I am inclined to think that the umpire\r\nkeeps his bat by him, firstly, in order that no unlicensed hand shall\r\ncommandeer it unbeknownst, and secondly, so that he shall be ready to\r\ngo in directly his predecessor is out. There is an ill-concealed\r\nrestiveness about his movements, as he watches the batsmen getting set,\r\nthat betrays an overwrought spirit. Then of a sudden one of them plays\r\na ball on to his pad. '_'s that_?' asks the bowler, with an\r\noverdone carelessness. 'Clean out. Now _I'm_ in,' and already he\r\nis rushing up the middle of the pitch to take possession. When he gets\r\nto the wicket a short argument ensues. 'Look here, you idiot, I hit it\r\nhard.' 'Rot, man, out of the way.' '!!??!' 'Look here, Smith,\r\n_are_ you going to dispute the umpire's decision?' Chorus of\r\nfieldsmen: 'Get out, Smith, you ass. You've been given out years ago.'\r\nOverwhelmed by popular execration, Smith reluctantly departs,\r\nregistering in the black depths of his soul a resolution to take on the\r\numpireship at once, with a view to gaining an artistic revenge by\r\ngiving his enemy run out on the earliest possible occasion. There is a\r\nprimeval _insouciance_ about this sort of thing which is as\r\nrefreshing to a mind jaded with the stiff formality of professional\r\numpires as a cold shower-bath.\r\n\r\nI have made a special study of last-wicket men; they are divided into\r\ntwo classes, the deplorably nervous, or the outrageously confident. The\r\nnervous largely outnumber the confident. The launching of a last-wicket\r\nman, when there are ten to make to win, or five minutes left to make a\r\ndraw of a losing game, is fully as impressive a ceremony as the\r\nlaunching of the latest battleship. An interested crowd harasses the\r\npoor victim as he is putting on his pads. 'Feel in a funk?' asks some\r\ntactless friend. 'N-n-no, norrabit.' 'That's right,' says the captain\r\nencouragingly, 'bowling's as easy as anything.'\r\n\r\nThis cheers the wretch up a little, until he remembers suddenly that\r\nthe captain himself was distinctly at sea with the despised trundling,\r\nand succumbed to his second ball, about which he obviously had no idea\r\nwhatever. At this he breaks down utterly, and, if emotional, will sob\r\ninto his batting glove. He is assisted down the Pavilion steps, and\r\nreaches the wickets in a state of collapse. Here, very probably, a\r\nreaction will set in. The sight of the crease often comes as a positive\r\nrelief after the vague terrors experienced in the Pavilion.\r\n\r\nThe confident last-wicket man, on the other hand, goes forth to battle\r\nwith a light quip upon his lips. The lot of a last-wicket batsman, with\r\na good eye and a sense of humour, is a very enviable one. The\r\nincredulous disgust of the fast bowler, who thinks that at last he may\r\nsafely try that slow head-ball of his, and finds it lifted genially\r\nover the leg-boundary, is well worth seeing. I remember in one school\r\nmatch, the last man, unfortunately on the opposite side, did this three\r\ntimes in one over, ultimately retiring to a fluky catch in the slips\r\nwith forty-one to his name. Nervousness at cricket is a curious thing.\r\nAs the author of _Willow the King_, himself a county cricketer,\r\nhas said, it is not the fear of getting out that causes funk. It is a\r\nsort of intangible _je ne sais quoi_. I trust I make myself clear.\r\nSome batsmen are nervous all through a long innings. With others the\r\nfeeling disappears with the first boundary.\r\n\r\nA young lady--it is, of course, not polite to mention her age to the\r\nminute, but it ranged somewhere between eight and ten--was taken to see\r\na cricket match once. After watching the game with interest for some\r\ntime, she gave out this profound truth: 'They all attend specially to\r\none man.' It would be difficult to sum up the causes of funk more\r\nlucidly and concisely. To be an object of interest is sometimes\r\npleasant, but when ten fieldsmen, a bowler, two umpires, and countless\r\nspectators are eagerly watching your every movement, the thing becomes\r\nembarrassing.\r\n\r\nThat is why it is, on the whole, preferable to be a cricket spectator\r\nrather than a cricket player. No game affords the spectator such unique\r\nopportunities of exerting his critical talents. You may have noticed\r\nthat it is always the reporter who knows most about the game. Everyone,\r\nmoreover, is at heart a critic, whether he represent the majesty of the\r\nPress or not. From the lady of Hoxton, who crushes her friend's latest\r\nconfection with the words, 'My, wot an 'at!' down to that lowest class\r\nof all, the persons who call your attention (in print) to the sinister\r\nmeaning of everything Clytemnestra says in _The Agamemnon_, the\r\nwhole world enjoys expressing an opinion of its own about something.\r\n\r\nIn football you are vouchsafed fewer chances. Practically all you can\r\ndo is to shout 'off-side' whenever an opponent scores, which affords\r\nbut meagre employment for a really critical mind. In cricket, however,\r\nnothing can escape you. Everything must be done in full sight of\r\neverybody. There the players stand, without refuge, simply inviting\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nIt is best, however, not to make one's remarks too loud. If you do, you\r\ncall down upon yourself the attention of others, and are yourself\r\ncriticized. I remember once, when I was of tender years, watching a\r\nschool match, and one of the batsmen lifted a ball clean over the\r\nPavilion. This was too much for my sensitive and critical young mind.\r\n'On the carpet, sir,' I shouted sternly, well up in the treble clef,\r\n'keep 'em on the carpet.' I will draw a veil. Suffice it to say that I\r\nbecame a sport and derision, and was careful for the future to\r\ncriticize in a whisper. But the reverse by no means crushed me. Even\r\nnow I take a melancholy pleasure in watching school matches, and saying\r\nSo-and-So will make quite a fair _school-boy_ bat in time, but he\r\nmust get rid of that stroke of his on the off, and that shocking\r\nleg-hit, and a few of those _awful_ strokes in the slips, but that\r\non the whole, he is by no means lacking in promise. I find it\r\nrefreshing. If, however, you feel compelled not merely to look on, but\r\nto play, as one often does at schools where cricket is compulsory, it\r\nis impossible to exaggerate the importance of white boots. The game you\r\nplay before you get white boots is not cricket, but a weak imitation.\r\nThe process of initiation is generally this. One plays in shoes for a\r\nfew years with the most dire result, running away to square leg from\r\nfast balls, and so on, till despair seizes the soul. Then an angel in\r\nhuman form, in the very effective disguise of the man at the school\r\nboot-shop, hints that, for an absurdly small sum in cash, you may\r\nbecome the sole managing director of a pair of _white buckskin_\r\nboots with real spikes. You try them on. They fit, and the initiation\r\nis complete. You no longer run away from fast balls. You turn them\r\nneatly off to the boundary. In a word, you begin for the first time to\r\nplay the game, the whole game, and nothing but the game.\r\n\r\nThere are misguided people who complain that cricket is becoming a\r\nbusiness more than a game, as if that were not the most fortunate thing\r\nthat could happen. When it ceases to be a mere business and becomes a\r\nreligious ceremony, it will be a sign that the millennium is at hand.\r\nThe person who regards cricket as anything less than a business is no\r\nfit companion, gentle reader, for the likes of you and me. As long as\r\nthe game goes in his favour the cloven hoof may not show itself. But\r\ngive him a good steady spell of leather-hunting, and you will know him\r\nfor what he is, a mere _dilettante_, a dabbler, in a word, a worm,\r\nwho ought never to be allowed to play at all. The worst of this species\r\nwill sometimes take advantage of the fact that the game in which they\r\nhappen to be playing is only a scratch game, upon the result of which\r\nno very great issues hang, to pollute the air they breathe with verbal,\r\nand the ground they stand on with physical, buffooneries. Many a time\r\nhave I, and many a time have you, if you are what I take you for, shed\r\ntears of blood, at the sight of such. Careless returns, overthrows--but\r\nenough of a painful subject. Let us pass on.\r\n\r\nI have always thought it a better fate for a man to be born a bowler\r\nthan a bat. A batsman certainly gets a considerable amount of innocent\r\nfun by snicking good fast balls just off his wicket to the ropes, and\r\nstanding stolidly in front against slow leg-breaks. These things are\r\ngood, and help one to sleep peacefully o' nights, and enjoy one's\r\nmeals. But no batsman can experience that supreme emotion of 'something\r\nattempted, something done', which comes to a bowler when a ball pitches\r\nin a hole near point's feet, and whips into the leg stump. It is one\r\ncrowded second of glorious life. Again, the words 'retired hurt' on the\r\nscore-sheet are far more pleasant to the bowler than the batsman. The\r\ngroan of a batsman when a loose ball hits him full pitch in the ribs is\r\ngenuine. But the 'Awfully-sorry-old-chap-it-slipped' of the bowler is\r\nnot. Half a loaf is better than no bread, as Mr Chamberlain might say,\r\nand if he cannot hit the wicket, he is perfectly contented with hitting\r\nthe man. In my opinion, therefore, the bowler's lot, in spite of\r\nbilliard table wickets, red marl, and such like inventions of a\r\ndegenerate age, is the happier one.\r\n\r\nAnd here, glowing with pride of originality at the thought that I have\r\nwritten of cricket without mentioning Alfred Mynn or Fuller Pilch, I\r\nheave a reminiscent sigh, blot my MS., and thrust my pen back into its\r\nsheath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[16]\r\n\r\nTHE TOM BROWN QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man in the corner had been trying to worry me into a conversation\r\nfor some time. He had asked me if I objected to having the window open.\r\nHe had said something rather bitter about the War Office, and had hoped\r\nI did not object to smoking. Then, finding that I stuck to my book\r\nthrough everything, he made a fresh attack.\r\n\r\n'I see you are reading _Tom Brown's Schooldays_,' he said.\r\n\r\nThis was a plain and uninteresting statement of fact, and appeared to\r\nme to require no answer. I read on.\r\n\r\n'Fine book, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Very.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you have heard of the Tom Brown Question?'\r\n\r\nI shut my book wearily, and said I had not.\r\n\r\n'It is similar to the Homeric Question. You have heard of that, I\r\nsuppose?'\r\n\r\nI knew that there was a discussion about the identity of the author of\r\nthe Iliad. When at school I had been made to take down notes on the\r\nsubject until I had grown to loathe the very name of Homer.\r\n\r\n'You see,' went on my companion, 'the difficulty about _Tom Brown's\r\nSchooldays_ is this. It is obvious that part one and part two were\r\nwritten by different people. You admit that, I suppose?'\r\n\r\n'I always thought Mr Hughes wrote the whole book.'\r\n\r\n'Dear me, not really? Why, I thought everyone knew that he only wrote\r\nthe first half. The question is, who wrote the second. I know, but I\r\ndon't suppose ten other people do. No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What makes you think he didn't write the second part?'\r\n\r\n'My dear sir, just read it. Read part one carefully, and then read part\r\ntwo. Why, you can see in a minute.'\r\n\r\nI said I had read the book three times, but had never noticed anything\r\npeculiar about it, except that the second half was not nearly so\r\ninteresting as the first.\r\n\r\n'Well, just tell me this. Do you think the same man created East and\r\nArthur? Now then.'\r\n\r\nI admitted that it was difficult to understand such a thing.\r\n\r\n'There was a time, of course,' continued my friend, 'when everybody\r\nthought as you do. The book was published under Hughes's name, and it\r\nwas not until Professor Burkett-Smith wrote his celebrated monograph on\r\nthe subject that anybody suspected a dual, or rather a composite,\r\nauthorship. Burkett-Smith, if you remember, based his arguments on two\r\nvery significant points. The first of these was a comparison between\r\nthe football match in the first part and the cricket match in the\r\nsecond. After commenting upon the truth of the former description, he\r\nwent on to criticize the latter. Do you remember that match? You do?\r\nVery well. You recall how Tom wins the toss on a plumb wicket?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Then with the usual liberality of young hands (I quote from the book)\r\nhe put the M.C.C. in first. Now, my dear sir, I ask you, would a school\r\ncaptain do that? I am young, says one of Gilbert's characters, the\r\nGrand Duke, I think, but, he adds, I am not so young as that. Tom may\r\nhave been young, but would he, _could_ he have been young enough\r\nto put his opponents in on a true wicket, when he had won the toss?\r\nWould the Tom Brown of part one have done such a thing?'\r\n\r\n'Never,' I shouted, with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n'But that's nothing to what he does afterwards. He permits, he actually\r\nsits there and permits, comic songs and speeches to be made during the\r\nluncheon interval. Comic Songs! Do you hear me, sir? COMIC SONGS!! And\r\nthis when he wanted every minute of time he could get to save the\r\nmatch. Would the Tom Brown of part one have done such a thing?'\r\n\r\n'Never, never.' I positively shrieked the words this time.\r\n\r\n'Burkett-Smith put that point very well. His second argument is founded\r\non a single remark of Tom's, or rather--'\r\n\r\n'Or rather,' I interrupted, fiercely,' or rather of the wretched\r\nmiserable--'\r\n\r\n'Contemptible,' said my friend.\r\n\r\n'Despicable, scoundrelly, impostor who masquerades as Tom in the second\r\nhalf of the book.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly,' said he. 'Thank you very much. I have often thought the same\r\nmyself. The remark to which I refer is that which he makes to the\r\nmaster while he is looking on at the M.C.C. match. In passing, sir,\r\nmight I ask you whether the Tom Brown of part one would have been on\r\nspeaking terms with such a master?'\r\n\r\nI shook my head violently. I was too exhausted to speak.\r\n\r\n'You remember the remark? The master commented on the fact that Arthur\r\nis a member of the first eleven. I forget Tom's exact words, but the\r\nsubstance of them is this, that, though on his merits Arthur was not\r\nworth his place, he thought it would do him such a lot of good being in\r\nthe team. Do I make myself plain, sir? He--thought--it--would--do--\r\nhim--such--a--lot--of--good--being--in--the--team!!!'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. We sat looking at one another, forming silently with\r\nour lips the words that still echoed through the carriage.\r\n\r\n'Burkett-Smith,' continued my companion, 'makes a great deal of that\r\nremark. His peroration is a very fine piece of composition. \"Whether\r\n(concludes he) the captain of a school cricket team who could own\r\nspontaneously to having been guilty of so horrible, so terrible an act\r\nof favouritismical jobbery, who could sit unmoved and see his team\r\nbeing beaten in the most important match of the season (and, indeed,\r\nfor all that the author tells us it may have been the only match of the\r\nseason), for no other reason than that he thought a first eleven cap\r\nwould prove a valuable tonic to an unspeakable personal friend of his,\r\nwhether, I say, the Tom Brown who acted thus could have been the Tom\r\nBrown who headed the revolt of the fags in part one, is a question\r\nwhich, to the present writer, offers no difficulties. I await with\r\nconfidence the verdict of a free, enlightened, and conscientious public\r\nof my fellow-countrymen.\" Fine piece of writing, that, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Very,' I said.\r\n\r\n'That pamphlet, of course, caused a considerable stir. Opposing parties\r\nbegan to be formed, some maintaining that Burkett-Smith was entirely\r\nright, others that he was entirely wrong, while the rest said he might\r\nhave been more wrong if he had not been so right, but that if he had\r\nnot been so mistaken he would probably have been a great deal more\r\ncorrect. The great argument put forward by the supporters of what I may\r\ncall the \"One Author\" view, was, that the fight in part two could not\r\nhave been written by anyone except the author of the fight with\r\nFlashman in the school-house hall. And this is the point which has led\r\nto all the discussion. Eliminate the Slogger Williams episode, and the\r\nwhole of the second part stands out clearly as the work of another\r\nhand. But there is one thing that seems to have escaped the notice of\r\neverybody.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?' I said.\r\n\r\nHe leant forward impressively, and whispered. 'Only the actual fight is\r\nthe work of the genuine author. The interference of Arthur has been\r\ninterpolated!'\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' I said. 'Not really?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Fact, I assure you. Why, think for a minute. Could a man capable\r\nof describing a fight as that fight is described, also be capable of\r\nstopping it just as the man the reader has backed all through is\r\nwinning? It would be brutal. Positively brutal, sir!'\r\n\r\n'Then, how do you explain it?'\r\n\r\n'A year ago I could not have told you. Now I can. For five years I have\r\nbeen unravelling the mystery by the aid of that one clue. Listen. When\r\nMr Hughes had finished part one, he threw down his pen and started to\r\nWales for a holiday. He had been there a week or more, when one day, as\r\nhe was reclining on the peak of a mountain looking down a deep\r\nprecipice, he was aware of a body of men approaching him. They were\r\ndressed soberly in garments of an inky black. Each had side whiskers,\r\nand each wore spectacles. \"Mr Hughes, I believe?\" said the leader, as\r\nthey came up to him.\r\n\r\n'\"Your servant, sir,\" said he.\r\n\r\n'\"We have come to speak to you on an important matter, Mr Hughes. We\r\nare the committee of the Secret Society For Putting Wholesome\r\nLiterature Within The Reach Of Every Boy, And Seeing That He Gets It.\r\nI, sir, am the president of the S.S.F.P.W.L.W.T.R.O.E.B.A.S.T.H.G.I.\"\r\nHe bowed.\r\n\r\n'\"Really, sir, I--er--don't think I have the pleasure,\" began Mr\r\nHughes.\r\n\r\n'\"You shall have the pleasure, sir. We have come to speak to you about\r\nyour book. Our representative has read Part I, and reports unfavourably\r\nupon it. It contains no moral. There are scenes of violence, and your\r\nhero is far from perfect.\"\r\n\r\n'\"I think you mistake my object,\" said Mr Hughes; \"Tom is a boy, not a\r\npatent medicine. In other words, he is not supposed to be perfect.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Well, I am not here to bandy words. The second part of your book\r\nmust be written to suit the rules of our Society. Do you agree, or\r\nshall we throw you over that precipice?\"\r\n\r\n'\"Never. I mean, I don't agree.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Then we must write it for you. Remember, sir, that you will be\r\nconstantly watched, and if you attempt to write that second part\r\nyourself--\"' (he paused dramatically). 'So the second part was written\r\nby the committee of the Society. So now you know.'\r\n\r\n'But,' said I, 'how do you account for the fight with Slogger\r\nWilliams?'\r\n\r\n'The president relented slightly towards the end, and consented to Mr\r\nHughes inserting a chapter of his own, on condition that the Society\r\nshould finish it. And the Society did. See?'\r\n\r\n'But--'\r\n\r\n'Ticket.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'Ticket, please, sir.'\r\n\r\nI looked up. The guard was standing at the open door. My companion had\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n'Guard,' said I, as I handed him my ticket, 'where's the gentleman who\r\ntravelled up with me?'\r\n\r\n'Gentleman, sir? I haven't seen nobody.'\r\n\r\n'Not a man in tweeds with red hair? I mean, in tweeds and owning red\r\nhair.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir. You've been alone in the carriage all the way up. Must have\r\ndreamed it, sir.'\r\n\r\nPossibly I did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Tales of St. Austin's, by P. G. Wodehouse"
