    "There is not much more of the story of William Tell. The death of\r\nGessler was a signal to the Swiss to rise in revolt, and soon the whole\r\ncountry was up in arms against the Austrians. It had been chiefly the\r\nfear of the Governor that had prevented a rising before. It had been\r\nbrewing for a long time. The people had been bound by a solemn oath to\r\ndrive the enemy out of the country. All through Switzerland\r\npreparations for a revolution were going on, and nobles and peasants\r\nhad united.\r\n\r\nDirectly the news arrived that the Governor was slain, meetings of the\r\npeople were held in every town in Switzerland, and it was resolved to\r\nbegin the revolution without delay. All the fortresses that Gessler had\r\nbuilt during his years of rule were carried by assault on the same\r\nnight. The last to fall was one which had only been begun a short time\r\nback, and the people who had been forced to help to build it spent a\r\nvery pleasant hour pulling down the stones which had cost them such\r\nlabour to put in their place. Even the children helped. It was a great\r\ntreat to them to break what they pleased without being told not to.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said Tell, as he watched them, \"in years to come, when these\r\nsame children are gray-haired, they will remember this night as freshly\r\nas they will remember it to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nA number of people rushed up, bearing the pole which Gessler's soldiers\r\nhad set up in the meadow. The hat was still on top of it, nailed to the\r\nwood by Tell's arrow.\r\n\r\n\"Here's the hat!\" shouted Ruodi--\"the hat to which we were to bow!\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do with it?\" cried several voices.\r\n\r\n\"Destroy it! Burn it!\" said others. \"To the flames with this emblem of\r\ntyranny!\"\r\n\r\nBut Tell stopped them.\r\n\r\n\"Let us preserve it,\" he said. \"Gessler set it up to be a means\r\nof enslaving the country; we will set it up as a memorial of our\r\nnewly-gained liberty. Nobly is fulfilled the oath we swore to drive\r\nthe tyrants from our land. Let the pole mark the spot where the\r\nrevolution finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _is_ it finished?\" said Arnold of Melchthal. \"It is a nice\r\npoint. When the Emperor of Austria hears that we have killed his friend\r\nGessler, and burnt down all his fine new fortresses, will he not come\r\nhere to seek revenge?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will,\" said Tell. \"And let him come. And let him bring all his\r\nmighty armies. We have driven out the enemy that was in our land. We\r\nwill meet and drive away the enemy that comes from another country.\r\nSwitzerland is not easy to attack. There are but a few mountain passes\r\nby which the foe can approach. We will stop these with our bodies. And\r\none great strength we have: we are united. And united we need fear no\r\nfoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted everybody.\r\n\r\n\"But who is this that approaches?\" said Tell. \"He seems excited.\r\nPerhaps he brings news.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Rösselmann the pastor, and he brought stirring news.\r\n\r\n\"These are strange times in which we live,\" said Rösselmann, coming up.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what has happened?\" cried everybody.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, and be amazed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! How came you by the news?\"\r\n\r\n\"John Müller of Schaffhausen brought it. And he is a truthful man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"As the Emperor rode from Stein to Baden the lords of Eschenbach and\r\nTegerfelden, jealous, it is said, of his power, fell upon him with\r\ntheir spears. His bodyguard were on the other side of a stream--the\r\nEmperor had just crossed it--and could not come to his assistance. He\r\ndied instantly.\"\r\n\r\nBy the death of the Emperor the revolution in Switzerland was enabled\r\nto proceed without check. The successor of the Emperor had too much to\r\ndo in defending himself against the slayers of his father to think of\r\nattacking the Swiss, and by the time he was at leisure they were too\r\nstrong to be attacked. So the Swiss became free.\r\n\r\nAs for William Tell, he retired to his home, and lived there very\r\nhappily ever afterwards with his wife and his two sons, who in a few\r\nyears became very nearly as skilful in the use of the cross-bow as\r\ntheir father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Some say the tale related here\r\n       Is amplified and twisted;\r\n     Some say it isn't very clear\r\n       That William Tell existed;\r\n     Some say he freed his country _so_,\r\n       The Governor demolished.\r\n     Perhaps he did. I only know\r\n       That taxes aren't abolished!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Illustrations and accompanying descriptive verses]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[PROLOGUE.]\r\n\r\n     The Swiss, against their Austrian foes,\r\n       Had ne'er a soul to lead 'em,\r\n     Till Tell, as you've heard tell, arose\r\n       And guided them to freedom.\r\n     Tell's tale we tell again--an act\r\n       For which pray no one scold us--\r\n     This tale of Tell we tell, in fact,\r\n       As this Tell tale was told us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE I.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Beneath a tyrant foreign yoke,\r\n       How love of freedom waxes!\r\n     (Especially when foreign folk\r\n       Come round collecting taxes.)\r\n     The Swiss, held down by Gessler's fist,\r\n       Would fain have used evasion;\r\n     Yet none there seemed who could resist\r\n       His methods of persuasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GESSLER'S METHODS OF PERSUASION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE II.\r\n\r\n\r\n     And pride so filled this Gessler's soul\r\n       (A monarch's pride outclassing),\r\n     He stuck his hat up on a pole,\r\n       That all might bow in passing.\r\n     Then rose the patriot, William Tell--\r\n       \"We've groaned 'neath Austria's sway first;\r\n     Must we be ruled by poles as well?\r\n       I've just a word to say first!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEY WOULD MARCH ABOUT, BEATING TIN CANS AND SHOUTING]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE III.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The crowd about the pole at morn\r\n       Used various \"persuaders\"--\r\n     They flung old cans (to prove their scorn\r\n       Of all tin-pot invaders);\r\n     And cabbage-stumps were freely dealt,\r\n       And apples (inexpensive),\r\n     And rotten eggs (to show they felt\r\n       A foreign yoke offensive).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EGG FLEW ACROSS THE MEADOW, AND BURST OVER LEUTHOLD'S\r\nSHOULDER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Said William Tell, \"And has this cuss\r\n       For conquest such a passion\r\n     He needs must set his cap at us\r\n       In this exalted fashion?\"\r\n     And then the people gave a cry,\r\n       'Twixt joy and apprehension,\r\n     To see him pass the symbol by\r\n       With studied inattention!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HERE! HI!\" SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS, \"STOP!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE V.\r\n\r\n\r\n     At first the sentinel, aghast,\r\n       Glared like an angry dumb thing;\r\n     Then \"Hi!\" he shouted, \"not so fast,\r\n       You're overlooking something!\"\r\n     The sturdy Tell made no response;\r\n       Then through the hills resounded\r\n     A mighty thwack upon his sconce--\r\n       The people were astounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEY SAW FRIESSHARDT RAISE HIS PIKE, AND BRING IT DOWN\r\nWITH ALL HIS FORCE ON TELL'S HEAD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Could Tell an insult such as this\r\n       Ignore or pass? I doubt it!\r\n     No, no; that patriotic Swiss\r\n       Was very cross about it.\r\n     The people, interested now,\r\n       Exclaimed, \"Here! Stop a minute\r\n     If there's to be a jolly row,\r\n       By Jingo! we'll be in it!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"LOOK HERE!\" HE BEGAN. \"LOOK THERE!\" SAID FRIESSHARDT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Said Tell, \"This satrap of the Duke\r\n       Is sore in need of gumption;\r\n     With my good bow I will rebuke\r\n       Such arrow-gant presumption.\"\r\n     \"Stand back!\" the soldier says, says he;\r\n       \"This roughness is unseemly!\"\r\n     The people cried, \"We _will_ be FREE!\"\r\n       And so they were--extremely!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRIESSHARDT RUSHED TO STOP HIM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n     They dealt that soldier thump on thump\r\n       (He hadn't any notion,\r\n     When on Tell's head he raised that bump,\r\n       Of raising this commotion);\r\n     Tell's arrow sped, the people crowed,\r\n       And loudly cheered his action;\r\n     While Tell's expressive features showed\r\n       A certain satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CROWD DANCED AND SHOUTED]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Now, when the cat's away, the mice\r\n       Are very enterprising,\r\n     But cats return, and, in a trice--\r\n       Well, Gessler nipped that rising.\r\n     And when those soldiers lodged complaint\r\n       (Which truly didn't lack ground),\r\n     The people practised self-restraint\r\n       And fell into the background.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"COME, COME, COME!\" SAID GESSLER, \"TELL ME ALL ABOUT\r\nIT\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE X.\r\n\r\n\r\n     And Tell, before the tyrant hailed,\r\n       No patriot you'd have guessed him,\r\n     For even his stout bosom quailed\r\n       When Gessler thus addressed him:--\r\n     \"As you're the crack shot of these Swiss\r\n       (I've often heard it said so),\r\n     Suppose you take a shot at this,\r\n       Placed on your youngster's head--so!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I HAVE HERE AN APPLE\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The bearing,\" as they say, \"of that\r\n       Lay in the apple-cation,\"\r\n     And nobody will wonder at\r\n       A parent's agitation;\r\n     That anguish filled Tell's bosom proud\r\n       Needs scarcely to be stated,\r\n     And, it will be observed, the crowd\r\n       Was also agitated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERE WAS A STIR OF EXCITEMENT IN THE CROWD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Said Gessler, \"This is all my eye!\r\n       Come, hurry up and _buck_ up!\r\n     Remember, if you miss, you die--\r\n       That ought to keep your pluck up.\r\n     The flying arrow may, no doubt,\r\n       Your offspring's bosom enter--\"\r\n     But here there rose a mighty shout:\r\n       \"By George! He's scored a centre!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOMENT'S SUSPENSE, AND THEN A TERRIFIC CHEER AROSE\r\nFROM THE SPECTATORS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n     But, as the arrow cleft the core,\r\n       Cried G. with indignation,\r\n     \"What was the second arrow for?\r\n       Come, no e-quiver-cation!\r\n     You had a second in your fist.\"\r\n       Said Tell, the missile grippin',\r\n     \"This shaft (had I that apple missed)\r\n       Was meant for you, my pippin!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SEIZE THAT MAN!\" HE SHOUTED]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n     With rage the tyrant said, said he,\r\n       \"It's time to stop this prating;\r\n     I find your style of repartee\r\n       Extremely irritating.\r\n     You'll hang for this, be pleased to note.\"\r\n       On this they bound and gagged him\r\n     (For Gessler's castle booked by boat),\r\n       And through the village dragged him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE WAS LED AWAY TO THE SHORE OF THE LAKE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n     But slips between the cup and lip,\r\n       When least expected, peer through--\r\n     A storm arose upon the trip\r\n       Which Tell alone could steer through.\r\n     Thus, of all hands he quickly got\r\n       (As you may see) the upper,\r\n     At Gessler took a parting shot,\r\n       And hurried home to supper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TELL'S SECOND ARROW HAD FOUND ITS MARK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Some say the tale related here\r\n       Is amplified and twisted;\r\n     Some say it isn't very clear\r\n       That William Tell existed;\r\n     Some say he freed his country <i>so</i>,\r\n       The Governor demolished.\r\n     Perhaps he did.
