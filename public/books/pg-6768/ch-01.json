Wodehouse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN UPSTAIRS\r\n\r\nSOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT\r\n\r\nDEEP WATERS\r\n\r\nWHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE\r\n\r\nBY ADVICE OF COUNSEL\r\n\r\nROUGH-HEW THEM HOW WE WILL\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO DISLIKED CATS\r\n\r\nRUTH IN EXILE\r\n\r\nARCHIBALD'S BENEFIT\r\n\r\nTHE MAN, THE MAID, AND THE MIASMA\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD ANGEL\r\n\r\nPOTS O' MONEY\r\n\r\nOUT OF SCHOOL\r\n\r\nTHREE FROM DUNSTERVILLE\r\n\r\nTHE TUPPENNY MILLIONAIRE\r\n\r\nAHEAD OF SCHEDULE\r\n\r\nSIR AGRAVAINE\r\n\r\nTHE GOAL-KEEPER AND THE PLUTOCRAT\r\n\r\nIN ALCALA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN UPSTAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were three distinct stages in the evolution of Annette Brougham's\r\nattitude towards the knocking in the room above. In the beginning it\r\nhad been merely a vague discomfort. Absorbed in the composition of her\r\nwaltz, she had heard it almost subconsciously. The second stage set in\r\nwhen it became a physical pain like red-hot pincers wrenching her mind\r\nfrom her music. Finally, with a thrill in indignation, she knew it for\r\nwhat it was--an insult. The unseen brute disliked her playing, and was\r\nintimating his views with a boot-heel.\r\n\r\nDefiantly, with her foot on the loud pedal, she struck--almost\r\nslapped--the keys once more.\r\n\r\n'Bang!' from the room above. 'Bang! Bang!'\r\n\r\nAnnette rose. Her face was pink, her chin tilted. Her eyes sparkled\r\nwith the light of battle. She left the room and started to mount the\r\nstairs. No spectator, however just, could have helped feeling a pang of\r\npity for the wretched man who stood unconscious of imminent doom,\r\npossibly even triumphant, behind the door at which she was on the point\r\nof tapping.\r\n\r\n'Come in!' cried the voice, rather a pleasant voice; but what is a\r\npleasant voice if the soul be vile?\r\n\r\nAnnette went in. The room was a typical Chelsea studio, scantily\r\nfurnished and lacking a carpet. In the centre was an easel, behind\r\nwhich were visible a pair of trousered legs. A cloud of grey smoke was\r\ncurling up over the top of the easel.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon,' began Annette.\r\n\r\n'I don't want any models at present,' said the Brute. 'Leave your card\r\non the table.'\r\n\r\n'I am not a model,' said Annette, coldly. 'I merely came--'\r\n\r\nAt this the Brute emerged from his fortifications and, removing his\r\npipe from his mouth, jerked his chair out into the open.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon,' he said. 'Won't you sit down?'\r\n\r\nHow reckless is Nature in the distribution of her gifts! Not only had\r\nthis black-hearted knocker on floors a pleasant voice, but, in\r\naddition, a pleasing exterior. He was slightly dishevelled at the\r\nmoment, and his hair stood up in a disordered mop; but in spite of\r\nthese drawbacks, he was quite passably good-looking. Annette admitted\r\nthis. Though wrathful, she was fair.\r\n\r\n'I thought it was another model,' he explained. 'They've been coming in\r\nat the rate of ten an hour ever since I settled here. I didn't object\r\nat first, but after about the eightieth child of sunny Italy had shown\r\nup it began to get on my nerves.'\r\n\r\nAnnette waited coldly till he had finished.\r\n\r\n'I am sorry,' she said, in a this-is-where-you-get-yours voice, 'if my\r\nplaying disturbed you.'\r\n\r\nOne would have thought nobody but an Eskimo wearing his furs and winter\r\nunder-clothing could have withstood the iciness of her manner; but the\r\nBrute did not freeze.\r\n\r\n'I am sorry,' repeated Annette, well below zero, 'if my playing\r\ndisturbed you. I live in the room below, and I heard you knocking.'\r\n\r\n'No, no,' protested the young man, affably; 'I like it. Really I do.'\r\n\r\n'Then why knock on the floor?' said Annette, turning to go. 'It is so\r\nbad for my ceiling,' she said over shoulder. 'I thought you would not\r\nmind my mentioning it. Good afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'No; but one moment. Don't go.'\r\n\r\nShe stopped. He was surveying her with a friendly smile. She noticed\r\nmost reluctantly that he had a nice smile. His composure began to\r\nenrage her more and more. Long ere this he should have been writhing at\r\nher feet in the dust, crushed and abject.\r\n\r\n'You see,' he said, 'I'm awfully sorry, but it's like this. I love\r\nmusic, but what I mean is, you weren't playing a _tune_. It was\r\njust the same bit over and over again.'\r\n\r\n'I was trying to get a phrase,' said Annette, with dignity, but less\r\ncoldly. In spite of herself she was beginning to thaw. There was\r\nsomething singularly attractive about this shock-headed youth.\r\n\r\n'A phrase?'\r\n\r\n'Of music. For my waltz. I am composing a waltz.'\r\n\r\nA look of such unqualified admiration overspread the young man's face\r\nthat the last remnants of the ice-pack melted. For the first time since\r\nthey had met Annette found herself positively liking this blackguardly\r\nfloor-smiter.\r\n\r\n'Can you compose music?' he said, impressed.\r\n\r\n'I have written one or two songs.'\r\n\r\n'It must be great to be able to do things--artistic things, I mean,\r\nlike composing.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you do, don't you? You paint.'\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his head with a cheerful grin.\r\n\r\n'I fancy,' he said, 'I should make a pretty good house-painter. I want\r\nscope. Canvas seems to cramp me.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to cause him no discomfort. He appeared rather amused than\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n'Let me look.'\r\n\r\nShe crossed over to the easel.\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't,' he warned her. 'You really want to? Is this not mere\r\nrecklessness? Very well, then.'\r\n\r\nTo the eye of an experienced critic the picture would certainly have\r\nseemed crude. It was a study of a dark-eyed child holding a large black\r\ncat. Statisticians estimate that there is no moment during the day when\r\none or more young artists somewhere on the face of the globe are not\r\npainting pictures of children holding cats.\r\n\r\n'I call it \"Child and Cat\",' said the young man. 'Rather a neat title,\r\ndon't you think? Gives you the main idea of the thing right away.\r\nThat,' he explained, pointing obligingly with the stem of his pipe, 'is\r\nthe cat.'\r\n\r\nAnnette belonged to that large section of the public which likes or\r\ndislikes a picture according to whether its subject happens to please\r\nor displease them. Probably there was not one of the million or so\r\nchild-and-cat eyesores at present in existence which she would not have\r\nliked. Besides, he had been very nice about her music.\r\n\r\n'I think it's splendid,' she announced.\r\n\r\nThe young man's face displayed almost more surprise than joy.\r\n\r\n'Do you really?' he said. 'Then I can die happy--that is, if you'll let\r\nme come down and listen to those songs of yours first.'\r\n\r\n'You would only knock on the floor,' objected Annette.\r\n\r\n'I'll never knock on another floor as long as I live,' said the\r\nex-brute, reassuringly. 'I hate knocking on floors. I don't see\r\nwhat people want to knock on floors _for_, anyway.'\r\n\r\nFriendships ripen quickly in Chelsea. Within the space of an hour and a\r\nquarter Annette had learned that the young man's name was Alan Beverley\r\n(for which Family Heraldic affliction she pitied rather than despised\r\nhim), that he did not depend entirely on his work for a living, having\r\na little money of his own, and that he considered this a fortunate\r\nthing. From the very beginning of their talk he pleased her. She found\r\nhim an absolutely new and original variety of the unsuccessful painter.\r\nUnlike Reginald Sellers, who had a studio in the same building, and\r\nsometimes dropped in to drink her coffee and pour out his troubles, he\r\ndid not attribute his non-success to any malice or stupidity on the\r\npart of the public. She was so used to hearing Sellers lash the\r\nPhilistine and hold forth on unappreciated merit that she could hardly\r\nbelieve the miracle when, in answer to a sympathetic bromide on the\r\npopular lack of taste in Art, Beverley replied that, as far as he was\r\nconcerned, the public showed strong good sense. If he had been striving\r\nwith every nerve to win her esteem, he could not have done it more\r\nsurely than with that one remark. Though she invariably listened with a\r\nsweet patience which encouraged them to continue long after the point\r\nat which she had begun in spirit to throw things at them, Annette had\r\nno sympathy with men who whined. She herself was a fighter. She hated\r\nas much as anyone the sickening blows which Fate hands out to the\r\nstruggling and ambitious; but she never made them the basis of a\r\nmonologue act. Often, after a dreary trip round the offices of the\r\nmusic-publishers, she would howl bitterly in secret, and even gnaw her\r\npillow in the watches of the night; but in public her pride kept her\r\nunvaryingly bright and cheerful.\r\n\r\nToday, for the first time, she revealed something of her woes. There\r\nwas that about the mop-headed young man which invited confidences. She\r\ntold him of the stony-heartedness of music-publishers, of the\r\ndifficulty of getting songs printed unless you paid for them, of their\r\nwretched sales.\r\n\r\n'But those songs you've been playing,' said Beverley, 'they've been\r\npublished?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, those three. But they are the only ones.'\r\n\r\n'And didn't they sell?'\r\n\r\n'Hardly at all. You see, a song doesn't sell unless somebody well known\r\nsings it. And people promise to sing them, and then don't keep their\r\nword. You can't depend on what they say.'\r\n\r\n'Give me their names,' said Beverley, 'and I'll go round tomorrow and\r\nshoot the whole lot. But can't you do anything?'\r\n\r\n'Only keep on keeping on.'\r\n\r\n'I wish,' he said, 'that any time you're feeling blue about things you\r\nwould come up and pour out the poison on me. It's no good bottling it\r\nup. Come up and tell me about it, and you'll feel ever so much better.\r\nOr let me come down. Any time things aren't going right just knock on\r\nthe ceiling.'\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n'Don't rub it in,' pleaded Beverley. 'It isn't fair. There's nobody so\r\nsensitive as a reformed floor-knocker. You will come up or let me come\r\ndown, won't you? Whenever I have that sad, depressed feeling, I go out\r\nand kill a policeman. But you wouldn't care for that. So the only thing\r\nfor you to do is to knock on the ceiling. Then I'll come charging down\r\nand see if there's anything I can do to help.'\r\n\r\n'You'll be sorry you ever said this.'\r\n\r\n'I won't,' he said stoutly.\r\n\r\n'If you really mean it, it _would_ be a relief,' she admitted.\r\n'Sometimes I'd give all the money I'm ever likely to make for someone\r\nto shriek my grievances at. I always think it must have been so nice\r\nfor the people in the old novels, when they used to say: \"Sit down and\r\nI will tell you the story of my life.\" Mustn't it have been heavenly?'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Beverley, rising, 'you know where I am if I'm wanted.\r\nRight up there where the knocking came from.'\r\n\r\n'Knocking?' said Annette. 'I remember no knocking.'\r\n\r\n'Would you mind shaking hands?' said Beverley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA particularly maddening hour with one of her pupils drove her up the\r\nvery next day. Her pupils were at once her salvation and her despair.\r\nThey gave her the means of supporting life, but they made life hardly\r\nworth supporting. Some of them were learning the piano. Others thought\r\nthey sang. All had solid ivory skulls. There was about a teaspoonful of\r\ngrey matter distributed among the entire squad, and the pupil Annette\r\nhad been teaching that afternoon had come in at the tail-end of the\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nIn the studio with Beverley she found Reginald Sellers, standing in a\r\ncritical attitude before the easel. She was not very fond of him. He\r\nwas a long, offensive, patronizing person, with a moustache that looked\r\nlike a smear of charcoal, and a habit of addressing her as 'Ah, little\r\none!'\r\n\r\nBeverley looked up.\r\n\r\n'Have you brought your hatchet, Miss Brougham? If you have, you're just\r\nin time to join in the massacre of the innocents. Sellers has been\r\nsmiting my child and cat hip and thigh. Look at his eye. There! Did you\r\nsee it flash then? He's on the warpath again.'\r\n\r\n'My dear Beverley,' said Sellers, rather stiffly, 'I am merely\r\nendeavouring to give you my idea of the picture's defects. I am sorry\r\nif my criticism has to be a little harsh.'\r\n\r\n'Go right on,' said Beverley, cordially. 'Don't mind me; it's all for\r\nmy good.'\r\n\r\n'Well, in a word, then, it is lifeless. Neither the child nor the cat\r\nlives.'\r\n\r\nHe stepped back a pace and made a frame of his hands.\r\n\r\n'The cat now,' he said. 'It is--how shall I put it? It has\r\nno--no--er--'\r\n\r\n'That kind of cat wouldn't,' said Beverley. 'It isn't that breed.'\r\n\r\n'I think it's a dear cat,' said Annette. She felt her temper, always\r\nquick, getting the better of her. She knew just how incompetent\r\nSellers was, and it irritated her beyond endurance to see Beverley's\r\ngood-humoured acceptance of his patronage.\r\n\r\n'At any rate,' said Beverley, with a grin, 'you both seem to recognize\r\nthat it is a cat. You're solid on that point, and that's something,\r\nseeing I'm only a beginner.'\r\n\r\n'I know, my dear fellow; I know,' said Sellers, graciously. 'You\r\nmustn't let my criticism discourage you. Don't think that your work\r\nlacks promise. Far from it. I am sure that in time you will do very\r\nwell indeed. Quite well.'\r\n\r\nA cold glitter might have been observed in Annette's eyes.\r\n\r\n'Mr Sellers,' she said, smoothly, 'had to work very hard himself before\r\nhe reached his present position. You know his work, of course?'\r\n\r\nFor the first time Beverley seemed somewhat confused.\r\n\r\n'I--er--why--' he began.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but of course you do,' she went on, sweetly. 'It's in all the\r\nmagazines.'\r\n\r\nBeverley looked at the great man with admiration, and saw that he had\r\nflushed uncomfortably. He put this down to the modesty of genius.\r\n\r\n'In the advertisement pages,' said Annette. 'Mr Sellers drew that\r\npicture of the Waukeesy Shoe and the Restawhile Settee and the tin of\r\nsardines in the Little Gem Sardine advertisement. He is very good at\r\nstill life.'\r\n\r\nThere was a tense silence. Beverley could almost hear the voice of the\r\nreferee uttering the count.\r\n\r\n'Miss Brougham,' said Sellers at last, spitting out the words, 'has\r\nconfined herself to the purely commercial side of my work. There is\r\nanother.'\r\n\r\n'Why, of course there is. You sold a landscape for five pounds only\r\neight months ago, didn't you? And another three months before that.'\r\n\r\nIt was enough. Sellers bowed stiffly and stalked from the room.\r\n\r\nBeverley picked up a duster and began slowly to sweep the floor with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing?' demanded Annette, in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n'The fragments of the wretched man,' whispered Beverley. 'They must be\r\nswept up and decently interred. You certainly have got the punch, Miss\r\nBrougham.'\r\n\r\nHe dropped the duster with a startled exclamation, for Annette had\r\nsuddenly burst into a flood of tears. With her face buried in her hands\r\nshe sat in her chair and sobbed desperately.\r\n\r\n'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\r\n\r\n'I'm a cat! I'm a beast! I hate myself!'\r\n\r\n'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\r\n\r\n'I'm a pig! I'm a fiend!'\r\n\r\n'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\r\n\r\n'We're all struggling and trying to get on and having hard luck, and\r\ninstead of doing what I can to help, I go and t-t-taunt him with not\r\nbeing able to sell his pictures! I'm not fit to live! _Oh!_'\r\n\r\n'Good Lord!' said Beverley, blankly.\r\n\r\nA series of gulping sobs followed, diminishing by degrees into silence.\r\nPresently she looked up and smiled, a moist and pathetic smile.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' she said, 'for being so stupid. But he was so horrid and\r\npatronizing to you, I couldn't help scratching. I believe I'm the worst\r\ncat in London.'\r\n\r\n'No, this is,' said Beverley, pointing to the canvas. 'At least,\r\naccording to the late Sellers. But, I say, tell me, isn't the deceased\r\na great artist, then? He came curveting in here with his chest out and\r\nstarted to slate my masterpiece, so I naturally said, \"What-ho! 'Tis a\r\ngenius!\" Isn't he?'\r\n\r\n'He can't sell his pictures anywhere. He lives on the little he can get\r\nfrom illustrating advertisements. And I t-taunt--'\r\n\r\n'_Please!_' said Beverley, apprehensively.\r\n\r\nShe recovered herself with a gulp.\r\n\r\n'I can't help it,' she said, miserably. 'I rubbed it in. Oh, it was\r\nhateful of me! But I was all on edge from teaching one of my awful\r\npupils, and when he started to patronize you--'\r\n\r\nShe blinked.\r\n\r\n'Poor devil!' said Beverley. 'I never guessed. Good Lord!'\r\n\r\nAnnette rose.\r\n\r\n'I must go and tell him I'm sorry,' she said. 'He'll snub me horribly,\r\nbut I must.'\r\n\r\nShe went out. Beverley lit a pipe and stood at the window looking\r\nthoughtfully down into the street.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a good rule in life never to apologize. The right sort of people\r\ndo not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of\r\nthem. Sellers belonged to the latter class. When Annette, meek,\r\npenitent, with all her claws sheathed, came to him and grovelled, he\r\nforgave her with a repulsive magnanimity which in a less subdued mood\r\nwould have stung her to renewed pugnacity. As it was, she allowed\r\nherself to be forgiven, and retired with a dismal conviction that from\r\nnow on he would be more insufferable than ever.\r\n\r\nHer surmise proved absolutely correct. His visits to the newcomer's\r\nstudio began again, and Beverley's picture, now nearing completion,\r\ncame in for criticism enough to have filled a volume. The good humour\r\nwith which he received it amazed Annette. She had no proprietary\r\ninterest in the painting beyond what she acquired from a growing regard\r\nfor its parent (which disturbed her a good deal when she had time to\r\nthink of it); but there were moments when only the recollection of her\r\nremorse for her previous outbreak kept her from rending the critic.\r\nBeverley, however, appeared to have no artistic sensitiveness\r\nwhatsoever. When Sellers savaged the cat in a manner which should have\r\nbrought the S.P.C.A. down upon him, Beverley merely beamed. His\r\nlong-sufferingness was beyond Annette's comprehension.\r\n\r\nShe began to admire him for it.\r\n\r\nTo make his position as critic still more impregnable, Sellers was now\r\nable to speak as one having authority. After years of floundering, his\r\nluck seemed at last to have turned. His pictures, which for months had\r\nlain at an agent's, careened like crippled battleships, had at length\r\nbegun to find a market. Within the past two weeks three landscapes and\r\nan allegorical painting had sold for good prices; and under the\r\ninfluence of success he expanded like an opening floweret. When\r\nEpstein, the agent, wrote to say that the allegory had been purchased\r\nby a Glasgow plutocrat of the name of Bates for one hundred and sixty\r\nguineas, Sellers' views on Philistines and their crass materialism and\r\nlack of taste underwent a marked modification. He spoke with some\r\nfriendliness of the man Bates.\r\n\r\n'To me,' said Beverley, when informed of the event by Annette, 'the\r\nmatter has a deeper significance. It proves that Glasgow has at last\r\nproduced a sober man. No drinker would have dared face that allegory.\r\nThe whole business is very gratifying.'\r\n\r\nBeverley himself was progressing slowly in the field of Art. He had\r\nfinished the 'Child and Cat', and had taken it to Epstein together with\r\na letter of introduction from Sellers. Sellers' habitual attitude now\r\nwas that of the kindly celebrity who has arrived and wishes to give the\r\nyoungsters a chance.\r\n\r\nSince its departure Beverley had not done much in the way of actual\r\nexecution. Whenever Annette came to his studio he was either sitting in\r\na chair with his feet on the window-sill, smoking, or in the same\r\nattitude listening to Sellers' views on art. Sellers being on the\r\nupgrade, a man with many pounds to his credit in the bank, had more\r\nleisure now. He had given up his advertisement work, and was planning a\r\ngreat canvas--another allegorical work. This left him free to devote a\r\ngood deal of time to Beverley, and he did so. Beverley sat and smoked\r\nthrough his harangues. He may have been listening, or he may not.\r\nAnnette listened once or twice, and the experience had the effect of\r\nsending her to Beverley, quivering with indignation.\r\n\r\n'Why do you _let_ him patronize you like that?' she demanded. 'If\r\nanybody came and talked to me like that about my music, I'd--I'd--I\r\ndon't know what I'd do. Yes, even if he were really a great musician.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you consider Sellers a great artist, then, even now?'\r\n\r\n'He seems to be able to sell his pictures, so I suppose they must be\r\ngood; but nothing could give him the right to patronize you as he\r\ndoes.'\r\n\r\n'\"My learned friend's manner would be intolerable in an emperor to a\r\nblack-beetle,\"' quoted Beverley. 'Well, what are we going to do about\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n'If only you could sell a picture, too!'\r\n\r\n'Ah! Well, I've done my part of the contract. I've delivered the goods.\r\nThere the thing is at Epstein's. The public can't blame me if it\r\ndoesn't sell. All they've got to do is to waltz in in their thousands\r\nand fight for it. And, by the way, talking of waltzes--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, it's finished,' said Annette, dispiritedly. 'Published too, for\r\nthat matter.'\r\n\r\n'Published! What's the matter, then? Why this drooping sadness? Why\r\naren't you running around the square, singing like a bird?'\r\n\r\n'Because,' said Annette, 'unfortunately, I had to pay the expenses of\r\npublication. It was only five pounds, but the sales haven't caught up\r\nwith that yet. If they ever do, perhaps there'll be a new edition.'\r\n\r\n'And will you have to pay for that?'\r\n\r\n'No. The publishers would.'\r\n\r\n'Who are they?'\r\n\r\n'Grusczinsky and Buchterkirch.'\r\n\r\n'Heavens, then what are you worrying about? The thing's a cert. A man\r\nwith a name like Grusczinsky could sell a dozen editions by himself.\r\nHelped and inspired by Buchterkirch, he will make the waltz the talk of\r\nthe country. Infants will croon it in their cots.'\r\n\r\n'He didn't seem to think so when I saw him last.'\r\n\r\n'Of course not. He doesn't know his own power. Grusczinsky's shrinking\r\ndiffidence is a by-word in musical circles. He is the genuine Human\r\nViolet. You must give him time.'\r\n\r\n'I'll give him anything if he'll only sell an edition or two,' said\r\nAnnette.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding thing was that he did. There seemed no particular\r\nreason why the sale of that waltz should not have been as small and as\r\nslow as that of any other waltz by an unknown composer. But almost\r\nwithout warning it expanded from a trickle into a flood. Grusczinsky,\r\nbeaming paternally whenever Annette entered the shop--which was\r\noften--announced two new editions in a week. Beverley, his artistic\r\ngrowth still under a watchful eye of Sellers, said he had never had\r\nany doubts as to the success of the thing from the moment when a single\r\nphrase in it had so carried him away that he had been compelled to stamp\r\nhis applause enthusiastically on the floor. Even Sellers forgot his own\r\ntriumphs long enough to allow him to offer affable congratulations. And\r\nmoney came rolling in, smoothing the path of life.\r\n\r\nThose were great days. There was a hat ...\r\n\r\nLife, in short, was very full and splendid. There was, indeed, but one\r\nthing which kept it from being perfect. The usual drawback to success is\r\nthat it annoys one's friends so; but in Annette's case this drawback was\r\nabsent. Sellers' demeanour towards her was that of an old-established\r\ninmate welcoming a novice into the Hall of Fame. Her pupils--worthy\r\nsouls, though bone-headed--fawned upon her. Beverley seemed more pleased\r\nthan anyone. Yet it was Beverley who prevented her paradise from being\r\ncomplete. Successful herself, she wanted all her friends to be successful;\r\nbut Beverley, to her discomfort, remained a cheery failure, and worse,\r\nabsolutely refused to snub Sellers. It was not as if Sellers' advice and\r\ncomments were disinterested. Beverley was simply the instrument on which\r\nhe played his songs of triumph. It distressed Annette to such an extent\r\nthat now, if she went upstairs and heard Sellers' voice in the studio,\r\nshe came down again without knocking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, sitting in her room, she heard the telephone-bell ring.\r\n\r\nThe telephone was on the stairs, just outside her door. She went out\r\nand took up the receiver.\r\n\r\n'Halloa!' said a querulous voice. 'Is Mr Beverley there?'\r\n\r\nAnnette remembered having heard him go out. She could always tell his\r\nfootstep.\r\n\r\n'He is out,' she said. 'Is there any message?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the voice, emphatically. 'Tell him that Rupert Morrison\r\nrang up to ask what he was to do with all this great stack of music\r\nthat's arrived. Does he want it forwarded on to him, or what?' The\r\nvoice was growing high and excited. Evidently Mr Morrison was in a\r\nstate of nervous tension when a man does not care particularly who\r\nhears his troubles so long as he unburdens himself of them to someone.\r\n\r\n'Music?' said Annette.\r\n\r\n'Music!' shrilled Mr Morrison. 'Stacks and stacks and stacks of it. Is\r\nhe playing a practical joke on me, or what?' he demanded, hysterically.\r\nPlainly he had now come to regard Annette as a legitimate confidante.\r\nShe was listening. That was the main point. He wanted someone--he did\r\nnot care whom--who would listen. 'He lends me his rooms,' wailed Mr\r\nMorrison, 'so that I can be perfectly quiet and undisturbed while I\r\nwrite my novel, and, first thing I know, this music starts to arrive.\r\nHow can I be quiet and undisturbed when the floor's littered two yards\r\nhigh with great parcels of music, and more coming every day?'\r\n\r\nAnnette clung weakly to the telephone box. Her mind was in a whirl, but\r\nshe was beginning to see many things.\r\n\r\n'Are you there?' called Mr Morrison.\r\n\r\n'Yes. What--what firm does the music come from?'\r\n\r\n'What's that?'\r\n\r\n'Who are the publishers who send the music?'\r\n\r\n'I can't remember. Some long name. Yes, I've got it. Grusczinsky and\r\nsomeone.'\r\n\r\n'I'll tell Mr Beverley,' said Annette, quietly. A great weight seemed\r\nto have settled on her head.\r\n\r\n'Halloa! Halloa! Are you there?' came Mr Morrison's voice.\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'And tell him there are some pictures, too.'\r\n\r\n'Pictures?'\r\n\r\n'Four great beastly pictures. The size of elephants. I tell you, there\r\nisn't room to move. And--'\r\n\r\nAnnette hung up the receiver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr Beverley, returned from his walk, was racing up the stairs three at\r\na time in his energetic way, when, as he arrived at Annette's door, it\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n'Have you a minute to spare?' said Annette.\r\n\r\n'Of course. What's the trouble? Have they sold another edition of the\r\nwaltz?'\r\n\r\n'I have not heard, Mr--Bates.'\r\n\r\nFor once she looked to see the cheerful composure of the man upstairs\r\nbecome ruffled; but he received the blow without agitation.\r\n\r\n'You know my name?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I know a good deal more than your name. You are a Glasgow\r\nmillionaire.'\r\n\r\n'It's true,' he admitted, 'but it's hereditary. My father was one\r\nbefore me.'\r\n\r\n'And you use your money,' said Annette, bitterly, 'creating fools'\r\nparadises for your friends, which last, I suppose, until you grow tired\r\nof the amusement and destroy them. Doesn't it ever strike you, Mr\r\nBates, that it's a little cruel? Do you think Mr Sellers will settle\r\ndown again cheerfully to hack-work when you stop buying his pictures,\r\nand he finds out that--that--'\r\n\r\n'I shan't stop,' said the young man. 'If a Glasgow millionaire mayn't\r\nbuy Sellers' allegorical pictures, whose allegorical pictures may he\r\nbuy? Sellers will never find out. He'll go on painting and I'll go on\r\nbuying, and all will be joy and peace.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed! And what future have you arranged for me?'\r\n\r\n'You?' he said, reflectively. 'I want to marry you.'\r\n\r\nAnnette stiffened from head to foot. He met her blazing eyes with a\r\nlook of quiet devotion.\r\n\r\n'Marry me?'\r\n\r\n'I know what you are thinking,' he said. 'Your mind is dwelling on the\r\nprospect of living in a house decorated throughout with Sellers'\r\nallegorical pictures. But it won't be. We'll store them in the attic.'\r\n\r\nShe began to speak, but he interrupted her.\r\n\r\n'Listen!' he said. 'Sit down and I will tell you the story of my life.\r\nWe'll skip the first twenty-eight years and three months, merely\r\nmentioning that for the greater part of that time I was looking for\r\nsomebody just like you. A month and nine days ago I found you. You were\r\ncrossing the Embankment. I was also on the Embankment. In a taxi. I\r\nstopped the taxi, got out, and observed you just stepping into the\r\nCharing Cross Underground. I sprang--'\r\n\r\n'This does not interest me,' said Annette.\r\n\r\n'The plot thickens,' he assured her. 'We left our hero springing, I\r\nthink. Just so. Well, you took the West End train and got off at Sloane\r\nSquare. So did I. You crossed Sloane Square, turned up King's Road, and\r\nfinally arrived here. I followed. I saw a notice up, \"Studio to Let\". I\r\nreflected that, having done a little painting in an amateur way, I\r\ncould pose as an artist all right; so I took the studio. Also the name\r\nof Alan Beverley. My own is Bill Bates. I had often wondered what it\r\nwould feel like to be called by some name like Alan Beverley or Cyril\r\nTrevelyan. It was simply the spin of the coin which decided me in\r\nfavour of the former. Once in, the problem was how to get to know you.\r\nWhen I heard you playing I knew it was all right. I had only to keep\r\nknocking on the floor long enough--'\r\n\r\n'Do--you--mean--to--tell--me'--Annette's voice trembled 'do you mean to\r\ntell me that you knocked that time simply to make me come up?'\r\n\r\n'That was it. Rather a scheme, don't you think? And now, would you mind\r\ntelling me how you found out that I had been buying your waltz? Those\r\nremarks of yours about fools' paradises were not inspired solely by\r\nthe affairs of Sellers. But it beats me how you did it. I swore\r\nRozinsky, or whatever his name is, to secrecy.'\r\n\r\n'A Mr Morrison,' said Annette, indifferently, 'rang up on the telephone\r\nand asked me to tell you that he was greatly worried by the piles of\r\nmusic which were littering the rooms you lent him.'\r\n\r\nThe young man burst into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n'Poor old Morrison! I forgot all about him. I lent him my rooms at the\r\nAlbany. He's writing a novel, and he can't work if the slightest thing\r\ngoes wrong. It just shows--'\r\n\r\n'Mr Bates!'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you didn't intend to hurt me. I dare say you meant only to be\r\nkind. But--but--oh, can't you see how you have humiliated me? You have\r\ntreated me like a child, giving me a make-believe success just to--just\r\nto keep me quiet, I suppose. You--'\r\n\r\nHe was fumbling in his pocket.\r\n\r\n'May I read you a letter?' he said.\r\n\r\n'A letter?'\r\n\r\n'Quite a short one. It is from Epstein, the picture-dealer. This is\r\nwhat he says. \"Sir,\" meaning me, not \"Dear Bill,\" mind you--just \"Sir.\"\r\n\"I am glad to be able to inform you that I have this morning received\r\nan offer of ten guineas for your picture, 'Child and Cat'. Kindly let\r\nme know if I am to dispose of it at this price.\"'\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Annette, in a small voice.\r\n\r\n'I have just been to Epstein's. It seems that the purchaser is a Miss\r\nBrown. She gave an address in Bayswater. I called at the address. No\r\nMiss Brown lives there, but one of your pupils does. I asked her if she\r\nwas expecting a parcel for Miss Brown, and she said that she had had\r\nyour letter and quite understood and would take it in when it arrived.'\r\n\r\nAnnette was hiding her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n'Go away!' she said, faintly.\r\n\r\nMr Bates moved a step nearer.\r\n\r\n'Do you remember that story of the people on the island who eked out a\r\nprecarious livelihood by taking in one another's washing?' he asked,\r\ncasually.\r\n\r\n'Go away!' cried Annette.\r\n\r\n'I've always thought,' he said, 'that it must have drawn them very\r\nclose together--made them feel rather attached to each other. Don't\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'Go away!'\r\n\r\n'I don't want to go away. I want to stay and hear you say you'll marry\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'_Please_ go away! I want to think.'\r\n\r\nShe heard him moving towards the door. He stopped, then went on again.\r\nThe door closed quietly. Presently from the room above came the sound\r\nof footsteps--footsteps pacing monotonously to and fro like those of an\r\nanimal in a cage.\r\n\r\nAnnette sat listening. There was no break in the footsteps.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she got up. In one corner of the room was a long pole used for\r\nraising and lowering the window-sash. She took it, and for a moment\r\nstood irresolute. Then with a quick movement, she lifted it and\r\nstabbed three times at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT\r\n\r\n\r\nA girl stood on the shingle that fringes Millbourne Bay, gazing at the\r\nred roofs of the little village across the water. She was a pretty\r\ngirl, small and trim. Just now some secret sorrow seemed to be\r\ntroubling her, for on her forehead were wrinkles and in her eyes a look\r\nof wistfulness. She had, in fact, all the distinguishing marks of one\r\nwho is thinking of her sailor lover.\r\n\r\nBut she was not. She had no sailor lover. What she was thinking of was\r\nthat at about this time they would be lighting up the shop-windows in\r\nLondon, and that of all the deadly, depressing spots she had ever\r\nvisited this village of Millbourne was the deadliest.\r\n\r\nThe evening shadows deepened. The incoming tide glistened oilily as it\r\nrolled over the mud flats. She rose and shivered.\r\n\r\n'Goo! What a hole!' she said, eyeing the unconscious village morosely.\r\n'_What_ a hole!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was Sally Preston's first evening in Millbourne. She had arrived\r\nby the afternoon train from London--not of her own free will. Left to\r\nherself, she would not have come within sixty miles of the place.\r\nLondon supplied all that she demanded from life. She had been born in\r\nLondon; she had lived there ever since--she hoped to die there. She\r\nliked fogs, motor-buses, noise, policemen, paper-boys, shops, taxi-cabs,\r\nartificial light, stone pavements, houses in long, grey rows, mud,\r\nbanana-skins, and moving-picture exhibitions. Especially moving-picture\r\nexhibitions. It was, indeed, her taste for these that had caused her\r\nbanishment to Millbourne.\r\n\r\nThe great public is not yet unanimous on the subject of moving-picture\r\nexhibitions. Sally, as I have said, approved of them. Her father, on\r\nthe other hand, did not. An austere ex-butler, who let lodgings in\r\nEbury Street and preached on Sundays in Hyde Park, he looked askance\r\nat the 'movies'. It was his boast that he had never been inside a\r\ntheatre in his life, and he classed cinema palaces with theatres as\r\nwiles of the devil. Sally, suddenly unmasked as an habitual frequenter\r\nof these abandoned places, sprang with one bound into prominence as\r\nthe Bad Girl of the Family. Instant removal from the range of\r\ntemptation being the only possible plan, it seemed to Mr Preston that\r\na trip to the country was indicated.\r\n\r\nHe selected Millbourne because he had been butler at the Hall there,\r\nand because his sister Jane, who had been a parlour-maid at the\r\nRectory, was now married and living in the village.\r\n\r\nCertainly he could not have chosen a more promising reformatory for\r\nSally. Here, if anywhere, might she forget the heady joys of the\r\ncinema. Tucked away in the corner of its little bay, which an\r\naccommodating island converts into a still lagoon, Millbourne lies\r\ndozing. In all sleepy Hampshire there is no sleepier spot. It is a\r\nplace of calm-eyed men and drowsy dogs. Things crumble away and are not\r\nreplaced. Tradesmen book orders, and then lose interest and forget to\r\ndeliver the goods. Only centenarians die, and nobody worries about\r\nanything--or did not until Sally came and gave them something to worry\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext door to Sally's Aunt Jane, in a cosy little cottage with a\r\nwonderful little garden, lived Thomas Kitchener, a large, grave,\r\nself-sufficing young man, who, by sheer application to work, had\r\nbecome already, though only twenty-five, second gardener at the Hall.\r\nGardening absorbed him. When he was not working at the Hall he was\r\nworking at home. On the morning following Sally's arrival, it being a\r\nThursday and his day off, he was crouching in a constrained attitude in\r\nhis garden, every fibre of his being concentrated on the interment of a\r\nplump young bulb. Consequently, when a chunk of mud came sailing over\r\nthe fence, he did not notice it.\r\n\r\nA second, however, compelled attention by bursting like a shell on the\r\nback of his neck. He looked up, startled. Nobody was in sight. He was\r\npuzzled. It could hardly be raining mud. Yet the alternative theory,\r\nthat someone in the next garden was throwing it, was hardly less\r\nbizarre. The nature of his friendship with Sally's Aunt Jane and old\r\nMr Williams, her husband, was comfortable rather than rollicking. It\r\nwas inconceivable that they should be flinging clods at him.\r\n\r\nAs he stood wondering whether he should go to the fence and look over,\r\nor simply accept the phenomenon as one of those things which no fellow\r\ncan understand, there popped up before him the head and shoulders of a\r\ngirl. Poised in her right hand was a third clod, which, seeing that\r\nthere was now no need for its services, she allowed to fall to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n'Halloa!' she said. 'Good morning.'\r\n\r\nShe was a pretty girl, small and trim. Tom was by way of being the\r\nstrong, silent man with a career to think of and no time for bothering\r\nabout girls, but he saw that. There was, moreover, a certain alertness\r\nin her expression rarely found in the feminine population of\r\nMillbourne, who were apt to be slightly bovine.\r\n\r\n'What do you think _you're_ messing about at?' she said, affably.\r\n\r\nTom was a slow-minded young man, who liked to have his thoughts well\r\nunder control before he spoke. He was not one of your gay rattlers.\r\nBesides, there was something about this girl which confused him to an\r\nextraordinary extent. He was conscious of new and strange emotions. He\r\nstood staring silently.\r\n\r\n'What's your name, anyway?'\r\n\r\nHe could answer that. He did so.\r\n\r\n'Oh! Mine's Sally Preston. Mrs Williams is my aunt. I've come from\r\nLondon.'\r\n\r\nTom had no remarks to make about London.\r\n\r\n'Have you lived here all your life?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Tom.\r\n\r\n'My goodness! Don't you ever feel fed up? Don't you want a change?'\r\n\r\nTom considered the point.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Well, _I_ do. I want one now.'\r\n\r\n'It's a nice place,' hazarded Tom.\r\n\r\n'It's nothing of the sort. It's the beastliest hole in existence. It's\r\nabsolutely chronic. Perhaps you wonder why I'm here. Don't think I\r\n_wanted_ to come here. Not me! I was sent. It was like this.' She\r\ngave him a rapid summary of her troubles. 'There! Don't you call it a\r\nbit thick?' she concluded.\r\n\r\nTom considered this point, too.\r\n\r\n'You must make the best of it,' he said, at length.\r\n\r\n'I won't! I'll make father take me back.'\r\n\r\nTom considered this point also. Rarely, if ever, had he been given so\r\nmany things to think about in one morning.\r\n\r\n'How?' he inquired, at length.\r\n\r\n'I don't know. I'll find some way. You see if I don't. I'll get away\r\nfrom here jolly quick, I give you _my_ word.'\r\n\r\nTom bent low over a rose-bush. His face was hidden, but the brown of\r\nhis neck seemed to take on a richer hue, and his ears were undeniably\r\ncrimson. His feet moved restlessly, and from his unseen mouth there\r\nproceeded the first gallant speech his lips had ever framed. Merely\r\nconsidered as a speech, it was, perhaps, nothing wonderful; but from\r\nTom it was a miracle of chivalry and polish.\r\n\r\nWhat he said was: 'I hope not.'\r\n\r\nAnd instinct telling him that he had made his supreme effort, and that\r\nanything further must be bathos, he turned abruptly and stalked into\r\nhis cottage, where he drank tea and ate bacon and thought chaotic\r\nthoughts. And when his appetite declined to carry him more than half-way\r\nthrough the third rasher, he understood. He was in love.\r\n\r\nThese strong, silent men who mean to be head-gardeners before they are\r\nthirty, and eliminate woman from their lives as a dangerous obstacle to\r\nthe successful career, pay a heavy penalty when they do fall in love.\r\nThe average irresponsible young man who has hung about North Street on\r\nSaturday nights, walked through the meadows and round by the mill and\r\nback home past the creek on Sunday afternoons, taken his seat in the\r\nbrake for the annual outing, shuffled his way through the polka at the\r\ntradesmen's ball, and generally seized all legitimate opportunities\r\nfor sporting with Amaryllis in the shade, has a hundred advantages\r\nwhich your successful careerer lacks. There was hardly a moment during\r\nthe days which followed when Tom did not regret his neglected\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nFor he was not Sally's only victim in Millbourne. That was the trouble.\r\nHer beauty was not of that elusive type which steals imperceptibly into\r\nthe vision of the rare connoisseur. It was sudden and compelling. It\r\nhit you. Bright brown eyes beneath a mass of fair hair, a determined\r\nlittle chin, a slim figure--these are disturbing things; and the\r\nyouths of peaceful Millbourne sat up and took notice as one youth.\r\nThrow your mind back to the last musical comedy you saw. Recall the\r\nleading lady's song with chorus of young men, all proffering devotion\r\nsimultaneously in a neat row. Well, that was how the lads of the\r\nvillage comported themselves towards Sally.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Williams, till then a highly-esteemed but little-frequented\r\ncouple, were astonished at the sudden influx of visitors. The cottage\r\nbecame practically a _salon_. There was not an evening when the\r\nlittle sitting-room looking out on the garden was not packed. It is\r\ntrue that the conversation lacked some of the sparkle generally found\r\nin the better class of _salon_. To be absolutely accurate, there\r\nwas hardly any conversation. The youths of Melbourne were sturdy and\r\nhonest. They were the backbone of England. England, in her hour of\r\nneed, could have called upon them with the comfortable certainty that,\r\nunless they happened to be otherwise engaged, they would leap to her\r\naid.\r\n\r\nBut they did not shine at small-talk. Conversationally they were a\r\nspent force after they had asked Mr Williams how his rheumatism was.\r\nThereafter they contented themselves with sitting massively about in\r\ncorners, glowering at each other. Still, it was all very jolly and\r\nsociable, and helped to pass the long evenings. And, as Mrs Williams\r\npointed out, in reply to some rather strong remarks from Mr Williams on\r\nthe subject of packs of young fools who made it impossible for a man to\r\nget a quiet smoke in his own home, it kept them out of the public-houses.\r\n\r\nTom Kitchener, meanwhile, observed the invasion with growing dismay.\r\nShyness barred him from the evening gatherings, and what was going on\r\nin that house, with young bloods like Ted Pringle, Albert Parsons,\r\nArthur Brown, and Joe Blossom (to name four of the most assiduous)\r\nexercising their fascinations at close range, he did not like to\r\nthink. Again and again he strove to brace himself up to join the feasts\r\nof reason and flows of soul which he knew were taking place nightly\r\naround the object of his devotions, but every time he failed. Habit is\r\na terrible thing; it shackles the strongest, and Tom had fallen into\r\nthe habit of inquiring after Mr Williams' rheumatism over the garden\r\nfence first thing in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt was a civil, neighbourly thing to do, but it annihilated the only\r\nexcuse he could think of for looking in at night. He could not help\r\nhimself. It was like some frightful scourge--the morphine habit, or\r\nsomething of that sort. Every morning he swore to himself that nothing\r\nwould induce him to mention the subject of rheumatism, but no sooner\r\nhad the stricken old gentleman's head appeared above the fence than\r\nout it came.\r\n\r\n'Morning, Mr Williams.'\r\n\r\n'Morning, Tom.'\r\n\r\nPause, indicative of a strong man struggling with himself; then:\r\n\r\n'How's the rheumatism, Mr Williams?'\r\n\r\n'Better, thank'ee, Tom.'\r\n\r\nAnd there he was, with his guns spiked.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did not give up. He brought to his wooing the same\r\ndetermination which had made him second gardener at the Hall at\r\ntwenty-five. He was a novice at the game, but instinct told him that a\r\ngood line of action was to shower gifts. He did so. All he had to shower\r\nwas vegetables, and he showered them in a way that would have caused the\r\ngoddess Ceres to be talked about. His garden became a perfect crater,\r\nerupting vegetables. Why vegetables? I think I hear some heckler cry.\r\nWhy not flowers--fresh, fair, fragrant flowers? You can do a lot with\r\nflowers. Girls love them. There is poetry in them. And, what is more,\r\nthere is a recognized language of flowers. Shoot in a rose, or a\r\ncalceolaria, or an herbaceous border, or something, I gather, and you\r\nhave made a formal proposal of marriage without any of the trouble of\r\nrehearsing a long speech and practising appropriate gestures in front\r\nof your bedroom looking-glass. Why, then, did not Thomas Kitchener give\r\nSally Preston flowers? Well, you see, unfortunately, it was now late\r\nautumn, and there were no flowers. Nature had temporarily exhausted her\r\nfloral blessings, and was jogging along with potatoes and artichokes\r\nand things. Love is like that. It invariably comes just at the wrong\r\ntime. A few months before there had been enough roses in Tom\r\nKitchener's garden to win the hearts of a dozen girls. Now there were\r\nonly vegetables, 'Twas ever thus.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that a devotion so practically displayed\r\nshould escape comment. This was supplied by that shrewd observer, old\r\nMr Williams. He spoke seriously to Tom across the fence on the subject\r\nof his passion.\r\n\r\n'Young Tom,' he said, 'drop it.'\r\n\r\nTom muttered unintelligibly. Mr Williams adjusted the top-hat without\r\nwhich he never stirred abroad, even into his garden. He blinked\r\nbenevolently at Tom.\r\n\r\n'You're making up to that young gal of Jane's,' he proceeded. 'You\r\ncan't deceive _me_. All these p'taties, and what not. _I_ seen\r\nyour game fast enough. Just you drop it, young Tom.'\r\n\r\n'Why?' muttered Tom, rebelliously. A sudden distaste for old Mr\r\nWilliams blazed within him.\r\n\r\n'Why? 'Cos you'll only burn your fingers if you don't, that's why. I\r\nbeen watching this young gal of Jane's, and I seen what sort of a young\r\ngal she be. She's a flipperty piece, that's what she be. You marry that\r\nyoung gal, Tom, and you'll never have no more quiet and happiness.\r\nShe'd just take and turn the place upsy-down on you. The man as marries\r\nthat young gal has got to be master in his own home. He's got to show\r\nher what's what. Now, you ain't got the devil in you to do that, Tom.\r\nYou're what I might call a sort of a sheep. I admires it in you, Tom. I\r\nlike to see a young man steady and quiet, same as what you be. So\r\nthat's how it is, you see. Just you drop this foolishness, young Tom,\r\nand leave that young gal be, else you'll burn your fingers, same as\r\nwhat I say.'\r\n\r\nAnd, giving his top-hat a rakish tilt, the old gentleman ambled\r\nindoors, satisfied that he had dropped a guarded hint in a pleasant and\r\ntactful manner.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed that this interview stung Tom to swift action.\r\nOtherwise, one cannot explain why he should not have been just as\r\nreticent on the subject nearest his heart when bestowing on Sally the\r\ntwenty-seventh cabbage as he had been when administering the hundred\r\nand sixtieth potato. At any rate, the fact remains that, as that\r\nfateful vegetable changed hands across the fence, something resembling\r\na proposal of marriage did actually proceed from him. As a sustained\r\npiece of emotional prose it fell short of the highest standard. Most of\r\nit was lost at the back of his throat, and what did emerge was mainly\r\ninaudible. However, as she distinctly caught the word 'love' twice, and\r\nas Tom was shuffling his feet and streaming with perspiration, and\r\nlooking everywhere at once except at her, Sally grasped the situation.\r\nWhereupon, without any visible emotion, she accepted him.\r\n\r\nTom had to ask her to repeat her remark. He could not believe his\r\nluck. It is singular how diffident a normally self-confident man can\r\nbecome, once he is in love. When Colonel Milvery, of the Hall, had\r\ninformed him of his promotion to the post of second gardener, Tom had\r\ndemanded no _encore_. He knew his worth. He was perfectly aware\r\nthat he was a good gardener, and official recognition of the fact left\r\nhim gratified, but unperturbed. But this affair of Sally was quite\r\nanother matter. It had revolutionized his standards of value--forced\r\nhim to consider himself as a man, entirely apart from his skill as a\r\ngardener. And until this moment he had had grave doubt as to whether,\r\napart from his skill as a gardener, he amounted to much.\r\n\r\nHe was overwhelmed. He kissed Sally across the fence humbly. Sally, for\r\nher part, seemed very unconcerned about it all. A more critical man\r\nthan Thomas Kitchener might have said that, to all appearances, the\r\nthing rather bored Sally.\r\n\r\n'Don't tell anybody just yet,' she stipulated.\r\n\r\nTom would have given much to be allowed to announce his triumph\r\ndefiantly to old Mr Williams, to say nothing of making a considerable\r\nnoise about it in the village; but her wish was law, and he reluctantly\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are moments in a man's life when, however enthusiastic a\r\ngardener he may be, his soul soars above vegetables. Tom's shot with a\r\njerk into the animal kingdom. The first present he gave Sally in his\r\ncapacity of fiance was a dog.\r\n\r\nIt was a half-grown puppy with long legs and a long tail, belonging\r\nto no one species, but generously distributing itself among about six.\r\nSally loved it, and took it with her wherever she went. And on one of\r\nthese rambles down swooped Constable Cobb, the village policeman,\r\npointing out that, contrary to regulations, the puppy had no collar.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that a judicious meekness on Sally's part might have\r\naverted disaster. Mr Cobb was human, and Sally was looking\r\nparticularly attractive that morning. Meekness, however, did not come\r\neasily to Sally. In a speech which began as argument and ended (Mr\r\nCobb proving solid and unyielding) as pure cheek, she utterly routed\r\nthe constable. But her victory was only a moral one, for as she turned\r\nto go Mr Cobb, dull red and puffing slightly, was already entering\r\nparticulars of the affair in his note-book, and Sally knew that the\r\nlast word was with him.\r\n\r\nOn her way back she met Tom Kitchener. He was looking very tough and\r\nstrong, and at the sight of him a half-formed idea, which she had\r\nregretfully dismissed as impracticable, of assaulting Constable Cobb,\r\nreturned to her in an amended form. Tom did not know it, but the\r\nreason why she smiled so radiantly upon him at that moment was that she\r\nhad just elected him to the post of hired assassin. While she did not\r\nwant Constable Cobb actually assassinated, she earnestly desired him\r\nto have his helmet smashed down over his eyes; and it seemed to her\r\nthat Tom was the man to do it.\r\n\r\nShe poured out her grievance to him and suggested her scheme. She even\r\nelaborated it.\r\n\r\n'Why shouldn't you wait for him one night and throw him into the creek?\r\nIt isn't deep, and it's jolly muddy.'\r\n\r\n'Um!' said Tom, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n'It would just teach him,' she pointed out.\r\n\r\nBut the prospect of undertaking the higher education of the police did\r\nnot seem to appeal to Tom. In his heart he rather sympathized with\r\nConstable Cobb. He saw the policeman's point of view. It is all very\r\nwell to talk, but when you are stationed in a sleepy village where no\r\none ever murders, or robs, or commits arson, or even gets drunk and\r\ndisorderly in the street, a puppy without a collar is simply a godsend.\r\nA man must look out for himself.\r\n\r\nHe tried to make this side of the question clear to Sally, but failed\r\nsignally. She took a deplorable view of his attitude.\r\n\r\n'I might have known you'd have been afraid,' she said, with a\r\ncontemptuous jerk of her chin. 'Good morning.'\r\n\r\nTom flushed. He knew he had never been afraid of anything in his life,\r\nexcept her; but nevertheless the accusation stung. And as he was still\r\nafraid of her he stammered as he began to deny the charge.\r\n\r\n'Oh, leave off!' said Sally, irritably. 'Suck a lozenge.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not afraid,' said Tom, condensing his remarks to their minimum as\r\nhis only chance of being intelligible.\r\n\r\n'You are.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not. It's just that I--'\r\n\r\nA nasty gleam came into Sally's eyes. Her manner was haughty.\r\n\r\n'It doesn't matter.' She paused. 'I've no doubt Ted Pringle will do\r\nwhat I want.'\r\n\r\nFor all her contempt, she could not keep a touch of uneasiness from her\r\neyes as she prepared to make her next remark. There was a look about\r\nTom's set jaw which made her hesitate. But her temper had run away with\r\nher, and she went on.\r\n\r\n'I am sure he will,' she said. 'When we became engaged he said that he\r\nwould do anything for me.'\r\n\r\nThere are some speeches that are such conversational knockout blows\r\nthat one can hardly believe that life will ever pick itself up and go\r\non again after them. Yet it does. The dramatist brings down the\r\ncurtain on such speeches. The novelist blocks his reader's path with a\r\nzareba of stars. But in life there are no curtains, no stars, nothing\r\nfinal and definite--only ragged pauses and discomfort. There was such\r\na pause now.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' said Tom at last. 'You promised to marry me.'\r\n\r\n'I know I did--and I promised to marry Ted Pringle!'\r\n\r\nThat touch of panic which she could not wholly repress, the panic that\r\ncomes to everyone when a situation has run away with them like a\r\nstrange, unmanageable machine, infused a shade too much of the defiant\r\ninto Sally's manner. She had wished to be cool, even casual, but she\r\nwas beginning to be afraid. Why, she could not have said. Certainly she\r\ndid not anticipate violence on Tom's part. Perhaps that was it. Perhaps\r\nit was just because he was so quiet that she was afraid. She had always\r\nlooked on him contemptuously as an amiable, transparent lout, and now\r\nhe was puzzling her. She got an impression of something formidable\r\nbehind his stolidity, something that made her feel mean and\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nShe fought against the feeling, but it gripped her; and, in spite of\r\nherself, she found her voice growing shrill and out of control.\r\n\r\n'I promised to marry Ted Pringle, and I promised to marry Joe Blossom,\r\nand I promised to marry Albert Parsons. And I was going to promise to\r\nmarry Arthur Brown and anybody else who asked me. So now you know! I\r\ntold you I'd make father take me back to London. Well, when he hears\r\nthat I've promised to marry four different men, I bet he'll have me\r\nhome by the first train.'\r\n\r\nShe stopped. She had more to say, but she could not say it. She stood\r\nlooking at him. And he looked at her. His face was grey and his mouth\r\noddly twisted. Silence seemed to fall on the whole universe.\r\n\r\nSally was really afraid now, and she knew it. She was feeling very\r\nsmall and defenceless in an extremely alarming world. She could not\r\nhave said what it was that had happened to her. She only knew that life\r\nhad become of a sudden very vivid, and that her ideas as to what was\r\namusing had undergone a striking change. A man's development is a slow\r\nand steady process of the years--a woman's a thing of an instant. In\r\nthe silence which followed her words Sally had grown up.\r\n\r\nTom broke the silence.\r\n\r\n'Is that true?' he said.\r\n\r\nHis voice made her start. He had spoken quietly, but there was a new\r\nnote in it, strange to her. Just as she could not have said what it was\r\nthat had happened to her, so now she could not have said what had\r\nhappened to Tom. He, too, had changed, but how she did not know. Yet\r\nthe explanation was simple. He also had, in a sense, grown up. He was\r\nno longer afraid of her.\r\n\r\nHe stood thinking. Hours seemed to pass.\r\n\r\n'Come along!' he said, at last, and he began to move off down the road.\r\n\r\nSally followed. The possibility of refusing did not enter her mind.\r\n\r\n'Where are you going?' she asked. It was unbearable, this silence.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.\r\n\r\nIn this fashion, he leading, she following, they went down the road\r\ninto a lane, and through a gate into a field. They passed into a second\r\nfield, and as they did so Sally's heart gave a leap. Ted Pringle was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nTed Pringle was a big young man, bigger even than Tom Kitchener, and,\r\nlike Tom, he was of silent habit. He eyed the little procession\r\ninquiringly, but spoke no word. There was a pause.\r\n\r\n'Ted,' said Tom, 'there's been a mistake.'\r\n\r\nHe stepped quickly to Sally's side, and the next moment he had swung\r\nher off her feet and kissed her.\r\n\r\nTo the type of mind that Millbourne breeds, actions speak louder than\r\nwords, and Ted Pringle, who had gaped, gaped no more. He sprang\r\nforward, and Tom, pushing Sally aside, turned to meet him.\r\n\r\nI cannot help feeling a little sorry for Ted Pringle. In the light of\r\nwhat happened, I could wish that it were possible to portray him as a\r\nhulking brute of evil appearance and worse morals--the sort of person\r\nconcerning whom one could reflect comfortably that he deserved all he\r\ngot. I should like to make him an unsympathetic character, over whose\r\ndownfall the reader would gloat. But honesty compels me to own that Ted\r\nwas a thoroughly decent young man in every way. He was a good citizen,\r\na dutiful son, and would certainly have made an excellent husband.\r\nFurthermore, in the dispute on hand he had right on his side fully as\r\nmuch as Tom. The whole affair was one of those elemental clashings of\r\nman and man where the historian cannot sympathize with either side at\r\nthe expense of the other, but must confine himself to a mere statement\r\nof what occurred. And, briefly, what occurred was that Tom, bringing to\r\nthe fray a pent-up fury which his adversary had had no time to\r\ngenerate, fought Ted to a complete standstill in the space of two\r\nminutes and a half.\r\n\r\nSally had watched the proceedings, sick and horrified. She had never\r\nseen men fight before, and the terror of it overwhelmed her. Her\r\nvanity received no pleasant stimulation from the thought that it was\r\nfor her sake that this storm had been let loose. For the moment her\r\nvanity was dead, stunned by collision with the realities. She found\r\nherself watching in a dream. She saw Ted fall, rise, fall again, and\r\nlie where he had fallen; and then she was aware that Tom was speaking.\r\n\r\n'Come along!'\r\n\r\nShe hung back. Ted was lying very still. Gruesome ideas presented\r\nthemselves. She had just accepted them as truth when Ted wriggled. He\r\nwriggled again. Then he sat up suddenly, looked at her with unseeing\r\neyes, and said something in a thick voice. She gave a little sob of\r\nrelief. It was ghastly, but not so ghastly as what she had been\r\nimagining.\r\n\r\nSomebody touched her arm. Tom was by her side, grim and formidable. He\r\nwas wiping blood from his face.\r\n\r\n'Come along!'\r\n\r\nShe followed him without a word. And presently, behold, in another\r\nfield, whistling meditatively and regardless of impending ill, Albert\r\nParsons.\r\n\r\nIn everything that he did Tom was a man of method. He did not depart\r\nfrom his chosen formula.\r\n\r\n'Albert,' he said, 'there's been a mistake.'\r\n\r\nAnd Albert gaped, as Ted had gaped.\r\n\r\nTom kissed Sally with the gravity of one performing a ritual.\r\n\r\nThe uglinesses of life, as we grow accustomed to them, lose their power\r\nto shock, and there is no doubt that Sally looked with a different eye\r\nupon this second struggle. She was conscious of a thrill of\r\nexcitement, very different from the shrinking horror which had seized\r\nher before. Her stunned vanity began to tingle into life again. The\r\nfight was raging furiously over the trampled turf, and quite suddenly,\r\nas she watched, she was aware that her heart was with Tom.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer two strange brutes fighting in a field. It was her man\r\nbattling for her sake.\r\n\r\nShe desired overwhelmingly that he should win, that he should not be\r\nhurt, that he should sweep triumphantly over Albert Parsons as he had\r\nswept over Ted Pringle.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it was evident, even to her, that he was being hurt, and\r\nthat he was very far from sweeping triumphantly over Albert Parsons. He\r\nhad not allowed himself time to recover from his first battle, and his\r\nblows were slow and weary. Albert, moreover, was made of sterner stuff\r\nthan Ted. Though now a peaceful tender of cows, there had been a time\r\nin his hot youth when, travelling with a circus, he had fought, week\r\nin, week out, relays of just such rustic warriors as Tom. He knew their\r\nmethods--their headlong rushes, their swinging blows. They were the\r\nmerest commonplaces of life to him. He slipped Tom, he side-stepped\r\nTom, he jabbed Tom; he did everything to Tom that a trained boxer can\r\ndo to a reckless novice, except knock the fight out of him, until\r\npresently, through the sheer labour of hitting, he, too, grew weary.\r\n\r\nNow, in the days when Albert Parsons had fought whole families of Toms\r\nin an evening, he had fought in rounds, with the boss holding the\r\nwatch, and half-minute rests, and water to refresh him, and all orderly\r\nand proper. Today there were no rounds, no rests, no water, and the\r\npeaceful tending of cows had caused flesh to grow where there had been\r\nonly muscle. Tom's headlong rushes became less easy to side-step, his\r\nswinging blows more difficult than the scientific counter that shot out\r\nto check them. As he tired Tom seemed to regain strength. The tide of\r\nthe battle began to ebb. He clinched, and Tom threw him off. He\r\nfeinted, and while he was feinting Tom was on him. It was the climax of\r\nthe battle--the last rally. Down went Albert, and stayed down.\r\nPhysically, he was not finished; but in his mind a question had framed\r\nitself--the question. 'Was it worth it?'--and he was answering, 'No.'\r\nThere were other girls in the world. No girl was worth all this\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nHe did not rise.\r\n\r\n'Come along!' said Tom.\r\n\r\nHe spoke thickly. His breath was coming in gasps. He was a terrible\r\nspectacle, but Sally was past the weaker emotions. She was back in the\r\nStone Age, and her only feeling was one of passionate pride. She tried\r\nto speak. She struggled to put all she felt into words, but something\r\nkept her dumb, and she followed him in silence.\r\n\r\nIn the lane outside his cottage, down by the creek, Joe Blossom was\r\nclipping a hedge. The sound of footsteps made him turn.\r\n\r\nHe did not recognize Tom till he spoke.\r\n\r\n'Joe, there's been a mistake,' said Tom.\r\n\r\n'Been a gunpowder explosion, more like,' said Joe, a simple, practical\r\nman. 'What you been doin' to your face?'\r\n\r\n'She's going to marry me, Joe.'\r\n\r\nJoe eyed Sally inquiringly.\r\n\r\n'Eh? You promised to marry _me_.'\r\n\r\n'She promised to marry all of us. You, me, Ted Pringle, and Albert\r\nParsons.'\r\n\r\n'Promised--to--marry--all--of--us!'\r\n\r\n'That's where the mistake was. She's only going to marry me. I--I've\r\narranged it with Ted and Albert, and now I've come to explain to you,\r\nJoe.'\r\n\r\n'You promised to marry--!'\r\n\r\nThe colossal nature of Sally's deceit was plainly troubling Joe\r\nBlossom. He expelled his breath in a long note of amazement. Then he\r\nsummed up.\r\n\r\n'Why you're nothing more nor less than a Joshua!'\r\n\r\nThe years that had passed since Joe had attended the village\r\nSunday-school had weakened his once easy familiarity with the\r\ncharacters of the Old Testament. It is possible that he had somebody\r\nelse in his mind.\r\n\r\nTom stuck doggedly to his point.\r\n\r\n'You can't marry her, Joe.'\r\n\r\nJoe Blossom raised his shears and clipped a protruding branch. The\r\npoint under discussion seemed to have ceased to interest him.\r\n\r\n'Who wants to?' he said. 'Good riddance!'\r\n\r\nThey went down the lane. Silence still brooded over them. The words\r\nshe wanted continued to evade her.\r\n\r\nThey came to a grassy bank. Tom sat down. He was feeling unutterably\r\ntired.\r\n\r\n'Tom!'\r\n\r\nHe looked up. His mind was working dizzily.\r\n\r\n'You're going to marry me,' he muttered.\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n'I know,' she said. 'Tom, dear, lay your head on my lap and go to\r\nsleep.'\r\n\r\nIf this story proves anything (beyond the advantage of being in good\r\ntraining when you fight), it proves that you cannot get away from the\r\nmoving pictures even in a place like Millbourne; for as Sally sat\r\nthere, nursing Tom, it suddenly struck her that this was the very\r\nsituation with which that 'Romance of the Middle Ages' film ended. You\r\nknow the one I mean. Sir Percival Ye Something (which has slipped my\r\nmemory for the moment) goes out after the Holy Grail; meets damsel in\r\ndistress; overcomes her persecutors; rescues her; gets wounded, and is\r\nnursed back to life in her arms. Sally had seen it a dozen times. And\r\nevery time she had reflected that the days of romance are dead, and\r\nthat that sort of thing can't happen nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorians of the social life of the later Roman Empire speak of a\r\ncertain young man of Ariminum, who would jump into rivers and swim in\r\n'em. When his friends said, 'You fish!' he would answer, 'Oh, pish!\r\nFish can't swim like _me_, they've no vim in 'em.'\r\n\r\nJust such another was George Barnert Callender.\r\n\r\nOn land, in his land clothes, George was a young man who excited little\r\nremark. He looked very much like other young men. He was much about the\r\nordinary height. His carriage suggested the possession of an ordinary\r\namount of physical strength. Such was George--on shore. But remove his\r\nclothes, drape him in a bathing-suit, and insert him in the water, and\r\ninstantly, like the gentleman in _The Tempest_, he 'suffered a\r\nsea-change into something rich and strange.' Other men puffed, snorted,\r\nand splashed. George passed through the ocean with the silent dignity of\r\na torpedo. Other men swallowed water, here a mouthful, there a pint,\r\nanon, maybe, a quart or so, and returned to the shore like foundering\r\nderelicts. George's mouth had all the exclusiveness of a fashionable\r\nclub. His breast-stroke was a thing to see and wonder at. When he did\r\nthe crawl, strong men gasped. When he swam on his back, you felt that\r\nthat was the only possible method of progression.\r\n\r\nGeorge came to Marvis Bay at about five o'clock one evening in July.\r\nMarvis Bay has a well-established reputation as a summer resort, and,\r\nwhile not perhaps in every respect the paradise which the excitable\r\nwriter of the local guide-book asserts it to be, on the whole it earns\r\nits reputation. Its sands are smooth and firm, sloping almost\r\nimperceptibly into the ocean. There is surf for those who like it, and\r\nsmoother water beyond for those whose ideals in bathing are not\r\nconfined to jumping up and down on a given jelly-fish. At the northern\r\nend of the beach there is a long pier. It was to this that George made\r\nhis way on his arrival.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant on the pier. Once you had passed the initial zareba of\r\nfruit stands, souvenir stands, ice-cream stands, and the lair of the\r\nenthusiast whose aim in life it was to sell you picture post-cards, and\r\nhad won through to the long walk where the seats were, you were\r\npractically alone with Nature. At this hour of the day the place was\r\ndeserted; George had it to himself. He strolled slowly along. The water\r\nglittered under the sun-rays, breaking into a flurry of white foam as\r\nit reached the beach. A cool breeze blew. The whole scenic arrangements\r\nwere a great improvement on the stuffy city he had left. Not that\r\nGeorge had come to Marvis Bay with the single aim of finding an\r\nantidote to metropolitan stuffiness. There was a more important reason.\r\nIn three days Marvis Bay was to be the scene of the production of\r\n_Fate's Footballs_, a comedy in four acts by G. Barnert Callender.\r\nFor George, though you would not have suspected it from his exterior,\r\nwas one of those in whose cerebra the grey matter splashes restlessly\r\nabout, producing strong curtains and crisp dialogue. The company was\r\ndue at Marvis Bay on the following evening for the last spasm of\r\nrehearsals.\r\n\r\nGeorge's mind, as he paced the pier, was divided between the beauties\r\nof Nature and the forthcoming crisis in his affairs in the ratio of\r\none-eighth to the former and seven-eighths to the latter. At the moment\r\nwhen he had left London, thoroughly disgusted with the entire\r\ntheatrical world in general and the company which was rehearsing\r\n_Fate's Footballs_ in particular, rehearsals had just reached that\r\nstage of brisk delirium when the author toys with his bottle of poison\r\nand the stage-manager becomes icily polite. _The Footpills_--as\r\nArthur Mifflin, the leading juvenile in the great play, insisted upon\r\ncalling it, much to George's disapproval--was his first piece. Never\r\nbefore had he been in one of those kitchens where many cooks prepare,\r\nand sometimes spoil, the theatrical broth. Consequently the chaos\r\nseemed to him unique. Had he been a more experienced dramatist, he would\r\nhave said to himself, 'Twas ever thus.' As it was, what he said to\r\nhimself--and others--was more forcible.\r\n\r\nHe was trying to dismiss the whole thing from his mind--a feat which\r\nhad hitherto proved beyond his powers--when Fate, in an unusually\r\nkindly mood, enabled him to do so in a flash by presenting to his\r\njaundiced gaze what, on consideration, he decided was the most\r\nbeautiful girl he had ever seen. 'When a man's afraid,' shrewdly sings\r\nthe bard, 'a beautiful maid is a cheering sight to see'. In the present\r\ninstance the sight acted on George like a tonic. He forgot that the lady\r\nto whom an injudicious management had assigned the role of heroine in\r\n_Fate's Footballs_ invariably--no doubt from the best motives--omitted\r\nto give the cynical _roue_ his cue for the big speech in Act III.\r\nHis mind no longer dwelt on the fact that Arthur Mifflin, an estimable\r\nperson in private life, and one who had been a friend of his at\r\nCambridge, preferred to deliver the impassioned lines of the great\r\nrenunciation scene in a manner suggesting a small boy (and a sufferer\r\nfrom nasal catarrh at that) speaking a piece at a Sunday-school treat.\r\nThe recollection of the hideous depression and gloom which the leading\r\ncomedian had radiated in great clouds fled from him like some grisly\r\nnightmare before the goddess of day. Every cell in his brain was\r\noccupied, to the exclusion of all other thoughts, by the girl swimming\r\nin the water below.\r\n\r\nShe swam well. His practised eye saw that. Her strong, easy strokes\r\ncarried her swiftly over the swell of the waves. He stared, transfixed.\r\nHe was a well-brought-up young man, and he knew how ill-bred it was to\r\nstare; but this was a special occasion. Ordinary rules of conventional\r\netiquette could not apply to a case like this. He stared. More, he\r\ngaped. As the girl passed on into the shadow of the pier he leaned\r\nfarther over the rail, and his neck extended in joints like a\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nAt this point the girl turned to swim on her back. Her eyes met his.\r\nHers were deep and clear; his, bulging. For what seemed an eternity to\r\nGeorge, she continued to look at him. Then, turning over again, she\r\nshot past under the pier.\r\n\r\nGeorge's neck was now at its full stretch. No power of will or muscle\r\ncould add another yard to it. Realizing this, he leaned farther over\r\nthe rail, and farther still. His hat slid from his hand. He grabbed at\r\nit, and, over-balancing, fell with a splash into the water.\r\n\r\nNow, in ordinary circumstances, to fall twelve feet into the ocean with\r\nall his clothes on would have incommoded George little. He would hardly\r\nhave noticed it. He would have swum to shore with merely a feeling of\r\namused self-reproach akin to that of the man who absent-mindedly walks\r\ninto a lamp-post in the street. When, therefore, he came to the\r\nsurface he prepared without agitation to strike out in his usual bold\r\nfashion. At this moment, however, two hands, grasping him beneath the\r\narms, lifted his head still farther from the waves, and a voice in his\r\near said, 'Keep still; don't struggle. There's no danger.'\r\n\r\nGeorge did not struggle. His brain, working with the cool rapidity of a\r\nbuzz-saw in an ice-box, had planned a line of action. Few things are\r\nmore difficult in this world for a young man than the securing of an\r\nintroduction to the right girl under just the right conditions. When he\r\nis looking his best he is presented to her in the midst of a crowd, and\r\nis swept away after a rapid hand-shake. When there is no crowd he has\r\ntoothache, or the sun has just begun to make his nose peel. Thousands\r\nof young lives have been saddened in this manner.\r\n\r\nHow different was George's case! By this simple accident, he reflected,\r\nas, helping the good work along with an occasional surreptitious\r\nleg-stroke, he was towed shorewards, there had been formed an\r\nacquaintanceship, if nothing more, which could not lightly be broken. A\r\ngirl who has saved a man from drowning cannot pass him by next day with\r\na formal bow. And what a girl, too! There had been a time, in extreme\r\nyouth, when his feminine ideal was the sort of girl who has fuzzy,\r\ngolden hair, and drops things. Indeed in his first year at the\r\nUniversity he had said--and written--as much to one of the type, the\r\nepisode concluding with a strong little drama, in which a wrathful,\r\ncheque-signing father had starred, supported by a subdued, misogynistic\r\nson. Which things, aided by the march of time, had turned George's\r\ntastes towards the healthy, open-air girl, who did things instead of\r\ndropping them.\r\n\r\nThe pleasantest functions must come to an end sooner or later; and in\r\ndue season George felt his heels grate on the sand. His preserver\r\nloosed her hold. They stood up and faced each other. George began to\r\nexpress his gratitude as best he could--it was not easy to find neat,\r\nconvincing sentences on the spur of the moment--but she cut him short.\r\n\r\n'Of course, it was nothing. Nothing at all,' she said, brushing the\r\nsea-water from her eyes. 'It was just lucky I happened to be there.'\r\n\r\n'It was splendid,' said the infatuated dramatist. 'It was magnificent.\r\nIt--'\r\n\r\nHe saw that she was smiling.\r\n\r\n'You're very wet,' she said.\r\n\r\nGeorge glanced down at his soaked clothes. It had been a nice suit\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n'Hadn't you better hurry back and change into something dry?'\r\n\r\nLooking round about him, George perceived that sundry of the\r\ninquisitive were swooping down, with speculation in their eyes. It was\r\ntime to depart.\r\n\r\n'Have you far to go?'\r\n\r\n'Not far. I'm staying at the Beach View Hotel.'\r\n\r\n'Why, so am I. I hope we shall meet again.'\r\n\r\n'We shall,' said George confidently.\r\n\r\n'How did you happen to fall in?'\r\n\r\n'I was--er--I was looking at something in the water.'\r\n\r\n'I thought you were,' said the girl, quietly.\r\n\r\nGeorge blushed.\r\n\r\n'I know,' he said, 'it was abominably rude of me to stare like that;\r\nbut--'\r\n\r\n'You should learn to swim,' interrupted the girl. 'I can't understand\r\nwhy every boy in the country isn't made to learn to swim before he's\r\nten years old. And it isn't a bit difficult, really. I could teach you\r\nin a week.'\r\n\r\nThe struggle between George and George's conscience was brief. The\r\nconscience, weak by nature and flabby from long want of exercise, had\r\nno sort of chance from the start.\r\n\r\n'I wish you would,' said George. And with those words he realized that\r\nhe had definitely committed himself to his hypocritical role. Till\r\nthat moment explanation would have been difficult, but possible. Now it\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\n'I will,' said the girl. 'I'll start tomorrow if you like.' She waded\r\ninto the water.\r\n\r\n'We'll talk it over at the hotel,' she said, hastily. 'Here comes a\r\ncrowd of horrid people. I'm going to swim out again.'\r\n\r\nShe hurried into deeper water, while George, turning, made his way\r\nthrough a growing throng of goggling spectators. Of the fifteen who got\r\nwithin speaking distance of him, six told him that he was wet. The\r\nother nine asked him if he had fallen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer name was Vaughan, and she was visiting Marvis Bay in company with\r\nan aunt. So much George ascertained from the management of the hotel.\r\nLater, after dinner, meeting both ladies on the esplanade, he gleaned\r\nfurther information--to wit, that her first name was Mary, that her\r\naunt was glad to make his acquaintance, liked Marvis Bay but preferred\r\nTrouville, and thought it was getting a little chilly and would go\r\nindoors.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of the third factor had a restorative effect upon\r\nGeorge's conversation, which had begun to languish. In feminine society\r\nas a rule he was apt to be constrained, but with Mary Vaughan it was\r\ndifferent. Within a couple of minutes he was pouring out his troubles.\r\nThe cue-withholding leading lady, the stick-like Mifflin, the funereal\r\ncomedian--up they all came, and she, gently sympathetic, was\r\nendeavouring, not without success, to prove to him that things were not\r\nso bad as they seemed.\r\n\r\n'It's sure to be all right on the night,' she said.\r\n\r\nHow rare is the combination of beauty and intelligence! George thought\r\nhe had never heard such a clear-headed, well-expressed remark.\r\n\r\n'I suppose it will,' he said, 'but they were very bad when I left.\r\nMifflin, for instance. He seems to think Nature intended him for a\r\nNapoleon of Advertising. He has a bee in his bonnet about booming the\r\npiece. Sits up at nights, when he ought to be sleeping or studying his\r\npart, thinking out new schemes for advertising the show. And the\r\ncomedian. His speciality is drawing me aside and asking me to write in\r\nnew scenes for him. I couldn't stand it any longer. I just came away\r\nand left them to fight it out among themselves.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sure you have no need to worry. A play with such a good story is\r\ncertain to succeed.'\r\n\r\nGeorge had previously obliged with a brief description of the plot of\r\n_The Footpills_.\r\n\r\n'Did you like the story?' he said, tenderly.\r\n\r\n'I thought it was fine.'\r\n\r\n'How sympathetic you are!' cooed George, glutinously, edging a little\r\ncloser. 'Do you know--'\r\n\r\n'Shall we be going back to the hotel?' said the girl.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose noisome creatures, the hired murderers of _Fate's Footpills_,\r\ndescended upon Marvis Bay early next afternoon, and George, meeting\r\nthem at the station, in reluctant pursuance of a promise given to\r\nArthur Mifflin, felt moodily that, if only they could make their\r\nacting one-half as full of colour as their clothes, the play would be\r\none of the most pronounced successes of modern times. In the forefront\r\ngleamed, like the white plumes of Navarre, the light flannel suit of\r\nArthur Mifflin, the woodenest juvenile in captivity.\r\n\r\nHis woodenness was, however, confined to stage rehearsals. It may be\r\nmentioned that, once the run of a piece had begun, he was sufficiently\r\nvolatile, and in private life he was almost excessively so--a fact\r\nwhich had been noted at an early date by the keen-eyed authorities of\r\nhis University, the discovery leading to his tearing himself away from\r\nAlma Mater by request with some suddenness. He was a long, slender\r\nyouth, with green eyes, jet-black hair, and a passionate fondness for\r\nthe sound of his own voice.\r\n\r\n'Well, here we are,' he said, kicking breezily at George's leg with his\r\ncane.\r\n\r\n'I saw you,' said George, coldly, side-stepping.\r\n\r\n'The whole team,' continued Mr Mifflin; 'all bright, bonny, and trained\r\nto the minute.'\r\n\r\n'What happened after I left?' George asked. 'Has anybody begun to act\r\nyet? Or are they waiting till the dress-rehearsal?'\r\n\r\n'The rehearsals,' admitted Mr Mifflin, handsomely, 'weren't perfect;\r\nbut you wait. It'll be all right on the night.'\r\n\r\nGeorge thought he had never heard such a futile, vapid remark.\r\n\r\n'Besides,' said Mr Mifflin, 'I have an idea which will make the show.\r\nLend me your ear--both ears. You shall have them back. Tell me: what\r\npulls people into a theatre? A good play? Sometimes. But failing that,\r\nas in the present case, what? Fine acting by the leading juvenile? We\r\nhave that, but it is not enough. No, my boy; advertisement is the\r\nthing. Look at all these men on the beach. Are they going to roll in of\r\ntheir own free wills to see a play like _The Footpills_? Not on\r\nyour life. About the time the curtain rises every man of them will be\r\nsitting in his own private corner of the beach--'\r\n\r\n'How many corners do you think the beach has?'\r\n\r\n'Gazing into a girl's eyes, singing, \"Shine on, thou harvest moon\", and\r\ntelling her how his boss is practically dependent on his advice. You\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\n'I don't,' said George, coldly.\r\n\r\n'Unless,' proceeded Mr Mifflin, 'we advertise. And by advertise, I\r\nmean advertise in the right way. We have a Press-agent, but for all the\r\ngood he does he might be back on the old farm, gathering in the hay.\r\nLuckily for us, I am among those present. I have brains, I have\r\nresource. What's that?'\r\n\r\n'I said nothing.'\r\n\r\n'I thought you did. Well, I have an idea which will drag these people\r\nlike a magnet. I thought it out coming down in the train.'\r\n\r\n'What is it?'\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you later. There are a few details to be worked upon first.\r\nMeanwhile, let us trickle to the sea-front and take a sail in one of\r\nthose boats. I am at my best in a boat. I rather fancy Nature intended\r\nme for a Viking.'\r\n\r\nMatters having been arranged with the financier to whom the boat\r\nbelonged, they set forth. Mr Mifflin, having remarked, 'Yo-ho!' in a\r\nmeditative voice, seated himself at the helm, somewhat saddened by his\r\nfailure to borrow a quid of tobacco from the _Ocean Beauty's_\r\nproprietor. For, as he justly observed, without properties and make-up,\r\nwhere were you? George, being skilled in the ways of boats, was in\r\ncharge of the sheet. The summer day had lost its oppressive heat. The\r\nsun no longer beat down on the face of the waters. A fresh breeze had\r\nsprung up. George, manipulating the sheet automatically, fell into a\r\nreverie. A moment comes in the life of every man when an inward voice\r\nwhispers to him, 'This is The One!' In George's case the voice had not\r\nwhispered; it had shouted. From now onward there could be but one woman\r\nin the world for him. From now onwards--The _Ocean Beauty_ gave a\r\nsudden plunge. George woke up.\r\n\r\n'What the deuce are you doing with that tiller?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n'My gentle somnambulist,' said Mr Mifflin, aggrieved, 'I was doing\r\nnothing with this tiller. We will now form a commission to inquire into\r\nwhat you were doing with that sheet. Were you asleep?'\r\n\r\n'My fault,' said George; 'I was thinking.'\r\n\r\n'If you must break the habit of a lifetime,' said Mr Mifflin,\r\ncomplainingly, 'I wish you would wait till we get ashore. You nearly\r\nupset us.'\r\n\r\n'It shan't happen again. They are tricky, these sailing boats--turn\r\nover in a second. Whatever you do, don't get her broadside on. There's\r\nmore breeze out here than I thought there was.'\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin uttered a startled exclamation.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?' asked George.\r\n\r\n'Just like a flash,' said Mr Mifflin, complacently. 'It's always the\r\nway with me. Give me time, and the artistic idea is bound to come. Just\r\nsome little thought, some little, apparently obvious, idea which stamps\r\nthe man of genius. It beats me why I didn't think of it before. Why, of\r\ncourse, a costume piece with a male star is a hundred times more\r\neffective.'\r\n\r\n'What are you talking about?'\r\n\r\n'I see now,' continued Mr Mifflin, 'that there was a flaw in my\r\noriginal plan. My idea was this. We were talking in the train about\r\nthe bathing down here, and Jane happened to say she could swim some,\r\nand it suddenly came to me.'\r\n\r\nJane was the leading woman, she who omitted to give cues.\r\n\r\n'I said to myself, \"George is a sportsman. He will be delighted to do\r\na little thing like that\".'\r\n\r\n'Like to do what?'\r\n\r\n'Why, rescue Jane.'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'She and you,' said Mr Mifflin, 'were to go in swimming together,\r\nwhile I waited on the sands, holding our bone-headed Press-agent on a\r\nleash. About a hundred yards from the shore up go her arms. Piercing\r\nscream. Agitated crowds on the beach. What is the matter? What has\r\nhappened? A touch of cramp. Will she be drowned? No! G. Barnert\r\nCallender, author of _Fate's Footballs_, which opens at the Beach\r\nTheatre on Monday evening next, at eight-fifteen sharp, will save her.\r\nSee! He has her. He is bringing her in. She is safe. How pleased her\r\nmother will be! And the public, what a bit of luck for them! They will\r\nbe able to see her act at eight-fifteen sharp on Monday after all. Back\r\nyou come to the shore. Cheering crowds. Weeping women. Strong\r\nsituation. I unleash the Press-agent, and off he shoots, in time to get\r\nthe story into the evening paper. It was a great idea, but I see now\r\nthere were one or two flaws in it.'\r\n\r\n'You do, do you?' said George.\r\n\r\n'It occurs to me on reflection that after all you wouldn't have agreed\r\nto it. A something, I don't know what, which is lacking in your nature,\r\nwould have made you reject the scheme.'\r\n\r\n'I'm glad that occurred to you.'\r\n\r\n'And a far greater flaw was that it was too altruistic. It boomed you\r\nand it boomed Jane, but I didn't get a thing out of it. My revised\r\nscheme is a thousand times better in every way.'\r\n\r\n'Don't say you have another.'\r\n\r\n'I have. And,' added Mr Mifflin, with modest pride, 'it is a winner.\r\nThis time I unhesitatingly assert that I have the goods. In about one\r\nminute from now you will hear me exclaim, in a clear musical voice, the\r\nsingle word, \"Jump!\" That is your cue to leap over the side as quick as\r\nyou can move, for at that precise moment this spanking craft is going\r\nto capsize.'\r\n\r\nGeorge spun round in his seat. Mr Mifflin's face was shining with\r\nkindly enthusiasm. The shore was at least two hundred yards away, and\r\nthat morning he had had his first swimming-lesson.\r\n\r\n'A movement of the tiller will do it. These accidents are common\r\nobjects of the seashore. I may mention that I can swim just enough to\r\nkeep myself afloat; so it's up to you. I wouldn't do this for everyone,\r\nbut, seeing that we were boys together--Are you ready?'\r\n\r\n'Stop!' cried George. 'Don't do it! Listen!'\r\n\r\n'Are you ready?'\r\n\r\nThe _Ocean Beauty_ gave a plunge.\r\n\r\n'You lunatic! Listen to me. It--'\r\n\r\n'Jump!' said Mr Mifflin.\r\n\r\nGeorge came to the surface some yards from the overturned boat, and,\r\nlooking round for Mr Mifflin, discovered that great thinker treading\r\nwater a few feet away.\r\n\r\n'Get to work, George,' he remarked.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to shake one's fist at a man when in deep water, but\r\nGeorge managed it.\r\n\r\n'For twopence,' he cried, 'I'd leave you to look after yourself.'\r\n\r\n'You can do better than that,' said Mr Mifflin. 'I'll give you\r\nthreepence to tow me in. Hurry up. It's cold.'\r\n\r\nIn gloomy silence George gripped him by the elbows. Mr Mifflin looked\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\r\n'We shall have a good house,' he said. 'The stalls are full already,\r\nand the dress-circle's filling. Work away, George, you're doing fine.\r\nThis act is going to be a scream from start to finish.'\r\n\r\nWith pleasant conversation he endeavoured to while away the monotony of\r\nthe journey; but George made no reply. He was doing some rapid\r\nthinking. With ordinary luck, he felt bitterly, all would have been\r\nwell. He could have gone on splashing vigorously under his teacher's\r\ncare for a week, gradually improving till he emerged into a reasonably\r\nproficient swimmer. But now! In an age of miracles he might have\r\nexplained away his present performance; but how was he to--And then\r\nthere came to him an idea--simple, as all great ideas are, but\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and trod water.\r\n\r\n'Tired?' said Mr Mifflin. 'Well, take a rest,' he added, kindly, 'take\r\na rest. No need to hurry.'\r\n\r\n'Look here,' said George, 'this piece is going to be recast. We're\r\ngoing to exchange parts. You're rescuing me. See? Never mind why. I\r\nhaven't time to explain it to you now. Do you understand?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Mr Mifflin.\r\n\r\n'I'll get behind you and push you; but don't forget, when we get to the\r\nshore, that you've done the rescuing.'\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin pondered.\r\n\r\n'Is this wise?' he said. 'It is a strong part, the rescuer, but I'm not\r\nsure the other wouldn't suit my style better. The silent hand-grip, the\r\ncatch in the voice. You want a practised actor for that. I don't think\r\nyou'd be up to it, George.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind about me. That's how it's going to be.'\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin pondered once more.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said at length, 'it wouldn't do. You mean well, George, but it\r\nwould kill the show. We'll go on as before.'\r\n\r\n'Will we?' said George, unpleasantly. 'Would you like to know what I'm\r\ngoing to do to you, then? I'm going to hit you very hard under the jaw,\r\nand I'm going to take hold of your neck and squeeze it till you lose\r\nconsciousness, and then I'm going to drag you to the beach and tell\r\npeople I had to hit you because you lost your head and struggled.'\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin pondered for the third time.\r\n\r\n'You are?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I am,' said George.\r\n\r\n'Then,' said Mr Mifflin, cordially, 'say no more. I take your point. My\r\nobjections are removed. But,' he concluded, 'this is the last time I\r\ncome bathing with you, George.'\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin's artistic misgivings as to his colleague's ability to\r\nhandle so subtle a part as that of rescuee were more than justified on\r\ntheir arrival. A large and interested audience had collected by the\r\ntime they reached the shore, an audience to which any artist should\r\nhave been glad to play; but George, forcing his way through, hurried to\r\nthe hotel without attempting to satisfy them. Not a single silent\r\nhand-shake did he bestow on his rescuer. There was no catch in his voice\r\nas he made the one remark which he did make--to a man with whiskers who\r\nasked him if the boat had upset. As an exhibition of rapid footwork\r\nhis performance was good. In other respects it was poor.\r\n\r\nHe had just changed his wet clothes--it seemed to him that he had\r\nbeen doing nothing but change his wet clothes since he had come to\r\nMarvis Bay--when Mr Mifflin entered in a bathrobe.\r\n\r\n'They lent me this downstairs,' he explained, 'while they dried my\r\nclothes. They would do anything for me. I'm the popular hero. My boy,\r\nyou made the mistake of your life when you threw up the rescuer part.\r\nIt has all the fat. I see that now. The rescuer plays the other man off\r\nthe stage every time. I've just been interviewed by the fellow on the\r\nlocal newspaper. He's correspondent to a couple of London papers. The\r\ncountry will ring with this thing. I've told them all the parts I've\r\never played and my favourite breakfast food. There's a man coming up to\r\ntake my photograph tomorrow. _Footpills_ stock has gone up with a\r\nrun. Wait till Monday and see what sort of a house we shall draw. By\r\nthe way, the reporter fellow said one funny thing. He asked if you\r\nweren't the same man who was rescued yesterday by a girl. I said of\r\ncourse not--that you had only come down yesterday. But he stuck to it\r\nthat you were.'\r\n\r\n'He was quite right.'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'I was.'\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin sat down on the bed.\r\n\r\n'This fellow fell off the pier, and a girl brought him in.'\r\n\r\nGeorge nodded.\r\n\r\n'And that was you?'\r\n\r\nGeorge nodded.\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin's eyes opened wide.\r\n\r\n'It's the heat,' he declared, finally. 'That and the worry of\r\nrehearsals. I expect a doctor could give the technical name for it.\r\nIt's a what-do-you-call-it--an obsession. You often hear of cases.\r\nFellows who are absolutely sane really, but cracked on one particular\r\nsubject. Some of them think they're teapots and things. You've got a\r\ncraving for being rescued from drowning. What happens, old man? Do you\r\nsuddenly get the delusion that you can't swim? No, it can't be that,\r\nbecause you were doing all the swimming for the two of us just now. I\r\ndon't know, though. Maybe you didn't realize that you were swimming?'\r\n\r\nGeorge finished lacing his shoe and looked up.\r\n\r\n'Listen,' he said; 'I'll talk slow, so that you can understand. Suppose\r\nyou fell off a pier, and a girl took a great deal of trouble to get you\r\nto the shore, would you say, \"Much obliged, but you needn't have been\r\nso officious. I can swim perfectly well?\"'\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin considered this point. Intelligence began to dawn in his\r\nface. 'There is more in this than meets the eye,' he said. 'Tell me\r\nall.'\r\n\r\n'This morning'--George's voice grew dreamy--'she gave me a\r\nswimming-lesson. She thought it was my first. Don't cackle like that.\r\nThere's nothing to laugh at.'\r\n\r\nMr Mifflin contradicted this assertion.\r\n\r\n'There is you,' he said, simply. 'This should be a lesson to you,\r\nGeorge. Avoid deceit. In future be simple and straightforward. Take me\r\nas your model. You have managed to scrape through this time. Don't risk\r\nit again. You are young. There is still time to make a fresh start. It\r\nonly needs will-power. Meanwhile, lend me something to wear. They are\r\ngoing to take a week drying my clothes.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a rehearsal at the Beach Theatre that evening. George\r\nattended it in a spirit of resignation and left it in one of elation.\r\nThree days had passed since his last sight of the company at work, and\r\nin those three days, apparently, the impossible had been achieved.\r\nThere was a snap and go about the piece now. The leading lady had at\r\nlength mastered that cue, and gave it out with bell-like clearness.\r\nArthur Mifflin, as if refreshed and braced by his salt-water bath, was\r\ninfusing a welcome vigour into his part. And even the comedian, George\r\ncould not help admitting, showed signs of being on the eve of becoming\r\nfunny. It was with a light heart and a light step that he made his way\r\nback to the hotel.\r\n\r\nIn the veranda were a number of basket-chairs. Only one was occupied.\r\nHe recognized the occupant.\r\n\r\n'I've just come back from a rehearsal,' he said, seating himself beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n'Really?'\r\n\r\n'The whole thing is different,' he went on, buoyantly. 'They know their\r\nlines. They act as if they meant it. Arthur Mifflin's fine. The\r\ncomedian's improved till you wouldn't know him. I'm awfully pleased\r\nabout it.'\r\n\r\n'Really?'\r\n\r\nGeorge felt damped.\r\n\r\n'I thought you might be pleased, too,' he said, lamely.\r\n\r\n'Of course I am glad that things are going well. Your accident this\r\nafternoon was lucky, too, in a way, was it not? It will interest people\r\nin the play.'\r\n\r\n'You heard about it?'\r\n\r\n'I have been hearing about nothing else.'\r\n\r\n'Curious it happening so soon after--'\r\n\r\n'And so soon before the production of your play. Most curious.'\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. George began to feel uneasy. You could never tell\r\nwith women, of course. It might be nothing; but it looked uncommonly as\r\nif--\r\n\r\nHe changed the subject.\r\n\r\n'How is your aunt this evening, Miss Vaughan?'\r\n\r\n'Quite well, thank you. She went in. She found it a little chilly.'\r\n\r\nGeorge heartily commended her good sense. A little chilly did not begin\r\nto express it. If the girl had been like this all the evening, he\r\nwondered her aunt had not caught pneumonia. He tried again.\r\n\r\n'Will you have time to give me another lesson tomorrow?' he said.\r\n\r\nShe turned on him.\r\n\r\n'Mr Callender, don't you think this farce has gone on long enough?'\r\n\r\nOnce, in the dear, dead days beyond recall, when but a happy child,\r\nGeorge had been smitten unexpectedly by a sportive playmate a bare\r\nhalf-inch below his third waistcoat-button. The resulting emotions\r\nwere still green in his memory. As he had felt then, so did he feel\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n'Miss Vaughan! I don't understand.'\r\n\r\n'Really?'\r\n\r\n'What have I done?'\r\n\r\n'You have forgotten how to swim.'\r\n\r\nA warm and prickly sensation began to manifest itself in the region of\r\nGeorge's forehead.\r\n\r\n'Forgotten!'\r\n\r\n'Forgotten. And in a few months. I thought I had seen you before, and\r\ntoday I remembered. It was just about this time last year that I saw\r\nyou at Hayling Island swimming perfectly wonderfully, and today you are\r\ntaking lessons. Can you explain it?'\r\n\r\nA frog-like croak was the best George could do in that line.\r\n\r\nShe went on.\r\n\r\n'Business is business, I suppose, and a play has to be advertised\r\nsomehow. But--'\r\n\r\n'You don't think--' croaked George.\r\n\r\n'I should have thought it rather beneath the dignity of an author; but,\r\nof course, you know your own business best. Only I object to being a\r\nconspirator. I am sorry for your sake that yesterday's episode\r\nattracted so little attention. Today it was much more satisfactory,\r\nwasn't it? I am so glad.'\r\n\r\nThere was a massive silence for about a hundred years.\r\n\r\n'I think I'll go for a short stroll,' said George.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nScarcely had he disappeared when the long form of Mr Mifflin emerged\r\nfrom the shadow beyond the veranda.\r\n\r\n'Could you spare me a moment?'\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up. The man was a stranger. She inclined her head\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n'My name is Mifflin,' said the other, dropping comfortably into the\r\nchair which had held the remains of George.\r\n\r\nThe girl inclined her head again more coldly; but it took more than\r\nthat to embarrass Mr Mifflin. Dynamite might have done it, but not\r\ncoldness.\r\n\r\n'_The_ Mifflin,' he explained, crossing his legs. 'I overheard\r\nyour conversation just now.'\r\n\r\n'You were listening?' said the girl, scornfully.\r\n\r\n'For all I was worth,' said Mr Mifflin. 'These things are very much a\r\nmatter of habit. For years I have been playing in pieces where I have\r\nhad to stand concealed up stage, drinking in the private conversation\r\nof other people, and the thing has become a second nature to me.\r\nHowever, leaving that point for a moment, what I wish to say is that I\r\nheard you--unknowingly, of course--doing a good man a grave injustice.'\r\n\r\n'Mr Callender could have defended himself if he had wished.'\r\n\r\n'I was not referring to George. The injustice was to myself.'\r\n\r\n'To you?'\r\n\r\n'I was the sole author of this afternoon's little drama. I like George,\r\nbut I cannot permit him to pose in any way as my collaborator. George\r\nhas old-fashioned ideas. He does not keep abreast of the times. He can\r\nwrite plays, but he needs a man with a big brain to boom them for him.\r\nSo, far from being entitled to any credit for this afternoon's work, he\r\nwas actually opposed to it.'\r\n\r\n'Then why did he pretend you had saved him?' she demanded.\r\n\r\n'George's,' said Mr Mifflin, 'is essentially a chivalrous nature. At\r\nany crisis demanding a display of the finer feelings he is there with\r\nthe goods before you can turn round. His friends frequently wrangle\r\nwarmly as to whether he is most like Bayard, Lancelot, or Happy\r\nHooligan. Some say one, some the other. It seems that yesterday you\r\nsaved him from a watery grave without giving him time to explain that\r\nhe could save himself. What could he do? He said to himself, \"She must\r\nnever know!\" and acted accordingly. But let us leave George, and\r\nreturn--'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, Mr Mifflin.' There was a break in her laugh. 'I don't think\r\nthere is any necessity. I think I understand now. It was very clever of\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'It was more than cleverness,' said Mr Mifflin, rising. 'It was\r\ngenius.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA white form came to meet George as he re-entered the veranda.\r\n\r\n'Mr Callender!'\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n'I'm very sorry I said such horrid things to you just now. I have been\r\ntalking to Mr Mifflin, and I want to say I think it was ever so nice\r\nand thoughtful of you. I understand everything.'\r\n\r\nGeorge did not, by a good deal; but he understood sufficient for his\r\nneeds. He shot forward as if some strong hand were behind him with a\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\n'Miss Vaughan--Mary--I--'\r\n\r\n'I think I hear aunt calling,' said she.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut a benevolent Providence has ordained that aunts cannot call for\r\never; and it is on record that when George entered his box on the two\r\nhundredth night of that great London success, _Fate's Footballs_,\r\nhe did not enter it alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible that, at about the time at which this story opens, you\r\nmay have gone into the Hotel Belvoir for a hair-cut. Many people did;\r\nfor the young man behind the scissors, though of a singularly gloomy\r\ncountenance, was undoubtedly an artist in his line. He clipped\r\njudiciously. He left no ridges. He never talked about the weather. And\r\nhe allowed you to go away unburdened by any bottle of hair-food.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, too, that, being there, you decided that you might as\r\nwell go the whole hog and be manicured at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely, moreover, that when you had got over the first\r\nshock of finding your hands so unexpectedly large and red, you felt\r\ndisposed to chat with the young lady who looked after that branch of\r\nthe business. In your genial way you may have permitted a note of gay\r\n(but gentlemanly) badinage to creep into your end of the dialogue.\r\n\r\nIn which case, if you had raised your eyes to the mirror, you would\r\ncertainly have observed a marked increase of gloom in the demeanour of\r\nthe young man attending to your apex. He took no official notice of the\r\nmatter. A quick frown. A tightening of the lips. Nothing more. Jealous\r\nas Arthur Welsh was of all who inflicted gay badinage, however\r\ngentlemanly, on Maud Peters, he never forgot that he was an artist.\r\nNever, even in his blackest moments, had he yielded to the temptation\r\nto dig the point of the scissors the merest fraction of an inch into a\r\nclient's skull.\r\n\r\nBut Maud, who saw, would understand. And, if the customer was an\r\nobservant man, he would notice that her replies at that juncture became\r\nsomewhat absent, her smile a little mechanical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJealousy, according to an eminent authority, is the 'hydra of\r\ncalamities, the sevenfold death'. Arthur Welsh's was all that and a bit\r\nover. It was a constant shadow on Maud's happiness. No fair-minded girl\r\nobjects to a certain tinge of jealousy. Kept within proper bounds, it\r\nis a compliment; it makes for piquancy; it is the gin in the\r\nginger-beer of devotion. But it should be a condiment, not a fluid.\r\n\r\nIt was the unfairness of the thing which hurt Maud. Her conscience was\r\nclear. She knew girls--several girls--who gave the young men with whom\r\nthey walked out ample excuse for being perfect Othellos. If she had\r\never flirted on the open beach with the baritone of the troupe of\r\npierrots, like Jane Oddy, she could have excused Arthur's attitude. If,\r\nlike Pauline Dicey, she had roller-skated for a solid hour with a\r\nblack-moustached stranger while her fiance floundered in Mug's Alley\r\nshe could have understood his frowning disapprovingly. But she was not\r\nlike Pauline. She scorned the coquetries of Jane. Arthur was the centre\r\nof her world, and he knew it. Ever since the rainy evening when he had\r\nsheltered her under his umbrella to her Tube station, he had known\r\nperfectly well how things were with her. And yet just because, in a\r\nstrictly business-like way, she was civil to her customers, he must\r\nscowl and bite his lip and behave generally as if it had been brought\r\nto his notice that he had been nurturing a serpent in his bosom. It was\r\nworse than wicked--it was unprofessional.\r\n\r\nShe remonstrated with him.\r\n\r\n'It isn't fair,' she said, one morning when the rush of customers had\r\nceased and they had the shop to themselves.\r\n\r\nMatters had been worse than usual that morning. After days of rain and\r\ngreyness the weather had turned over a new leaf. The sun glinted among\r\nthe bottles of Unfailing Lotion in the window, and everything in the\r\nworld seemed to have relaxed and become cheerful. Unfortunately,\r\neverything had included the customers. During the last few days they\r\nhad taken their seats in moist gloom, and, brooding over the prospect\r\nof coming colds in the head, had had little that was pleasant to say to\r\nthe divinity who was shaping their ends. But today it had been\r\ndifferent. Warm and happy, they had bubbled over with gay small-talk.\r\n\r\n'It isn't fair,' she repeated.\r\n\r\nArthur, who was stropping a razor and whistling tunelessly, raised his\r\neyebrows. His manner was frosty.\r\n\r\n'I fail to understand your meaning,' he said.\r\n\r\n'You know what I mean. Do you think I didn't see you frowning when I\r\nwas doing that gentleman's nails?'\r\n\r\nThe allusion was to the client who had just left--a jovial individual\r\nwith a red face, who certainly had made Maud giggle a good deal. And\r\nwhy not? If a gentleman tells really funny stories, what harm is there\r\nin giggling? You had to be pleasant to people. If you snubbed\r\ncustomers, what happened? Why, sooner or later, it got round to the\r\nboss, and then where were you? Besides, it was not as if the red-faced\r\ncustomer had been rude. Write down on paper what he had said to her,\r\nand nobody could object to it. Write down on paper what she had said to\r\nhim, and you couldn't object to that either. It was just Arthur's\r\nsilliness.\r\n\r\nShe tossed her head.\r\n\r\n'I am gratified,' said Arthur, ponderously--in happier moments Maud\r\nhad admired his gift of language; he read a great deal: encyclopedias\r\nand papers and things--'I am gratified to find that you had time to\r\nbestow a glance on me. You appeared absorbed.'\r\n\r\nMaud sniffed unhappily. She had meant to be cold and dignified\r\nthroughout the conversation, but the sense of her wrongs was beginning\r\nto be too much for her. A large tear splashed on to her tray of\r\norange-sticks. She wiped it away with the chamois leather.\r\n\r\n'It isn't fair,' she sobbed. 'It isn't. You know I can't help it if\r\ngentlemen talk and joke with me. You know it's all in the day's work.\r\nI'm expected to be civil to gentlemen who come in to have their hands\r\ndone. Silly I should look sitting as if I'd swallowed a poker. I\r\n_do_ think you might understand, Arthur, you being in the\r\nprofession yourself.'\r\n\r\nHe coughed.\r\n\r\n'It isn't so much that you talk to them as that you seem to like--'\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Maud's dignity had melted completely. Her face was buried\r\nin her arms. She did not care if a million customers came in, all at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n'Maud!'\r\n\r\nShe heard him moving towards her, but she did not look up. The next\r\nmoment his arms were round her, and he was babbling.\r\n\r\nAnd a customer, pushing open the door unnoticed two minutes later,\r\nretired hurriedly to get shaved elsewhere, doubting whether Arthur's\r\nmind was on his job.\r\n\r\nFor a time this little thunderstorm undoubtedly cleared the air. For a\r\nday or two Maud was happier than she ever remembered to have been.\r\nArthur's behaviour was unexceptionable. He bought her a wrist-watch--\r\nlight brown leather, very smart. He gave her some chocolates to eat in\r\nthe Tube. He entertained her with amazing statistics, culled from the\r\nweekly paper which he bought on Tuesdays. He was, in short, the perfect\r\nlover. On the second day the red-faced man came in again. Arthur joined\r\nin the laughter at his stories. Everything seemed ideal.\r\n\r\nIt could not last. Gradually things slipped back into the old routine.\r\nMaud, looking up from her work, would see the frown and the bitten lip.\r\nShe began again to feel uncomfortable and self-conscious as she worked.\r\nSometimes their conversation on the way to the Tube was almost formal.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to say anything. She had a wholesome horror of being one\r\nof those women who nagged; and she felt that to complain again would\r\namount to nagging. She tried to put the thing out of her mind, but it\r\ninsisted on staying there. In a way she understood his feelings. He\r\nloved her so much, she supposed, that he hated the idea of her\r\nexchanging a single word with another man. This, in the abstract, was\r\ngratifying; but in practice it distressed her. She wished she were some\r\nsort of foreigner, so that nobody could talk to her. But then they\r\nwould look at her, and that probably would produce much the same\r\nresults. It was a hard world for a girl.\r\n\r\nAnd then the strange thing happened. Arthur reformed. One might almost\r\nsay that he reformed with a jerk. It was a parallel case to those\r\nsudden conversions at Welsh revival meetings. On Monday evening he had\r\nbeen at his worst. On the following morning he was a changed man. Not\r\neven after the original thunderstorm had he been more docile. Maud\r\ncould not believe that first. The lip, once bitten, was stretched in a\r\nsmile. She looked for the frown. It was not there.\r\n\r\nNext day it was the same; and the day after that. When a week had gone\r\nby, and still the improvement was maintained, Maud felt that she might\r\nnow look upon it as permanent. A great load seemed to have been taken\r\noff her mind. She revised her views on the world. It was a very good\r\nworld, quite one of the best, with Arthur beaming upon it like a sun.\r\n\r\nA number of eminent poets and essayists, in the course of the last few\r\ncenturies, have recorded, in their several ways, their opinion that one\r\ncan have too much of a good thing. The truth applies even to such a\r\ngood thing as absence of jealousy. Little by little Maud began to grow\r\nuneasy. It began to come home to her that she preferred the old Arthur,\r\nof the scowl and the gnawed lip. Of him she had at least been sure.\r\nWhatever discomfort she may have suffered from his spirited imitations\r\nof Othello, at any rate they had proved that he loved her. She would\r\nhave accepted gladly an equal amount of discomfort now in exchange for\r\nthe same certainty. She could not read this new Arthur. His thoughts\r\nwere a closed book. Superficially, he was all that she could have\r\nwished. He still continued to escort her to the Tube, to buy her\r\noccasional presents, to tap, when conversing, the pleasantly\r\nsentimental vein. But now these things were not enough. Her heart was\r\ntroubled. Her thoughts frightened her. The little black imp at the back\r\nof her mind kept whispering and whispering, till at last she was forced\r\nto listen. 'He's tired of you. He doesn't love you any more. He's tired\r\nof you.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not everybody who, in times of mental stress, can find ready to\r\nhand among his or her personal acquaintances an expert counsellor,\r\nprepared at a moment's notice to listen with sympathy and advise with\r\ntact and skill. Everyone's world is full of friends, relatives, and\r\nothers, who will give advice on any subject that may be presented to\r\nthem; but there are crises in life which cannot be left to the amateur.\r\nIt is the aim of a certain widely read class of paper to fill this\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nOf this class _Fireside Chat_ was one of the best-known\r\nrepresentatives. In exchange for one penny its five hundred thousand\r\nreaders received every week a serial story about life in highest\r\ncircles, a short story packed with heart-interest, articles on the\r\nremoval of stains and the best method of coping with the cold mutton,\r\nanecdotes of Royalty, photographs of peeresses, hints on dress, chats\r\nabout baby, brief but pointed dialogues between Blogson and Snogson,\r\npoems, Great Thoughts from the Dead and Brainy, half-hours in the\r\neditor's cosy sanctum, a slab of brown paper, and--the journal's\r\nleading feature--Advice on Matters of the Heart. The weekly\r\ncontribution of the advice specialist of _Fireside Chat_, entitled\r\n'In the Consulting Room, by Dr Cupid', was made up mainly of Answers to\r\nCorrespondents. He affected the bedside manner of the kind, breezy old\r\nphysician; and probably gave a good deal of comfort. At any rate, he\r\nalways seemed to have plenty of cases on his hands.\r\n\r\nIt was to this expert that Maud took her trouble. She had been a\r\nregular reader of the paper for several years; and had, indeed,\r\nconsulted the great man once before, when he had replied favourably to\r\nher query as to whether it would be right for her to accept caramels\r\nfrom Arthur, then almost a stranger. It was only natural that she\r\nshould go to him now, in an even greater dilemma. The letter was not\r\neasy to write, but she finished it at last; and, after an anxious\r\ninterval, judgement was delivered as follows:\r\n\r\n'Well, well, well! Bless my soul, what is all this? M. P. writes me:\r\n\r\n'I am a young lady, and until recently was very, very happy, except\r\nthat my fiance, though truly loving me, was of a very jealous\r\ndisposition, though I am sure I gave him no cause. He would scowl when\r\nI spoke to any other man, and this used to make me unhappy. But for\r\nsome time now he has quite changed, and does not seem to mind at all,\r\nand though at first this made me feel happy, to think that he had got\r\nover his jealousy, I now feel unhappy because I am beginning to be\r\nafraid that he no longer cares for me. Do you think this is so, and\r\nwhat ought I to do?'\r\n\r\n'My dear young lady, I should like to be able to reassure you; but it\r\nis kindest sometimes, you know, to be candid, however it may hurt. It\r\nhas been my experience that, when jealousy flies out of the window,\r\nindifference comes in at the door. In the old days a knight would joust\r\nfor the love of a ladye, risking physical injury rather than permit\r\nothers to rival him in her affections. I think, M. P., that you should\r\nendeavour to discover the true state of your fiance's feelings. I do\r\nnot, of course, advocate anything in the shape of unwomanly behaviour,\r\nof which I am sure, my dear young lady, you are incapable; but I think\r\nthat you should certainly try to pique your fiance, to test him. At\r\nyour next ball, for instance, refuse him a certain number of dances, on\r\nthe plea that your programme is full. At garden-parties, at-homes, and\r\nso on, exhibit pleasure in the society and conversation of other\r\ngentlemen, and mark his demeanour as you do so. These little tests\r\nshould serve either to relieve your apprehensions, provided they are\r\ngroundless, or to show you the truth. And, after all, if it is the\r\ntruth, it must be faced, must it not, M. P.?'\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the day Maud knew the whole passage by heart. The\r\nmore her mind dwelt on it, the more clearly did it seem to express what\r\nshe had felt but could not put into words. The point about jousting\r\nstruck her as particularly well taken. She had looked up 'joust' in the\r\ndictionary, and it seemed to her that in these few words was contained\r\nthe kernel of her trouble. In the old days, if any man had attempted to\r\nrival him in her affections (outside business hours), Arthur would\r\nundoubtedly have jousted--and jousted with the vigour of one who means\r\nto make his presence felt. Now, in similar circumstances, he would\r\nprobably step aside politely, as who should say, 'After you, my dear\r\nAlphonse.'\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose. An hour after her first perusal of Dr\r\nCupid's advice, Maud had begun to act upon it. By the time the first\r\nlull in the morning's work had come, and there was a chance for private\r\nconversation, she had invented an imaginary young man, a shadowy\r\nLothario, who, being introduced into her home on the previous Sunday by\r\nher brother Horace, had carried on in a way you wouldn't believe,\r\npaying all manner of compliments.\r\n\r\n'He said I had such white hands,' said Maud.\r\n\r\nArthur nodded, stropping a razor the while. He appeared to be bearing\r\nthe revelations with complete fortitude. Yet, only a few weeks before,\r\na customer's comment on this same whiteness had stirred him to his\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\n'And this morning--what do you think? Why, he meets me as bold as you\r\nplease, and gives me a cake of toilet soap. Like his impudence!'\r\n\r\nShe paused, hopefully.\r\n\r\n'Always useful, soap,' said Arthur, politely sententious.\r\n\r\n'Lovely it was,' went on Maud, dully conscious of failure, but\r\nstippling in like an artist the little touches which give atmosphere\r\nand verisimilitude to a story. 'All scented. Horace will tease me about\r\nit, I can tell you.'\r\n\r\nShe paused. Surely he must--Why, a sea-anemone would be torn with\r\njealousy at such a tale.\r\n\r\nArthur did not even wince. He was charming about it. Thought it very\r\nkind of the young fellow. Didn't blame him for being struck by the\r\nwhiteness of her hands. Touched on the history of soap, which he\r\nhappened to have been reading up in the encyclopedia at the free\r\nlibrary. And behaved altogether in such a thoroughly gentlemanly\r\nfashion that Maud stayed awake half the night, crying.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf Maud had waited another twenty-four hours there would have been no\r\nneed for her to have taxed her powers of invention, for on the\r\nfollowing day there entered the shop and her life a young man who was\r\nnot imaginary--a Lothario of flesh and blood. He made his entry with\r\nthat air of having bought most of the neighbouring property which\r\nbelongs exclusively to minor actors, men of weight on the Stock\r\nExchange, and American professional pugilists.\r\n\r\nMr 'Skipper' Shute belonged to the last-named of the three classes. He\r\nhad arrived in England two months previously for the purpose of holding\r\na conference at eight-stone four with one Joseph Edwardes, to settle a\r\nquestion of superiority at that weight which had been vexing the\r\nsporting public of two countries for over a year. Having successfully\r\nout-argued Mr Edwardes, mainly by means of strenuous work in the\r\nclinches, he was now on the eve of starting on a lucrative music-hall\r\ntour with his celebrated inaudible monologue. As a result of these\r\nthings he was feeling very, very pleased with the world in general, and\r\nwith Mr Skipper Shute in particular. And when Mr Shute was pleased with\r\nhimself his manner was apt to be of the breeziest.\r\n\r\nHe breezed into the shop, took a seat, and, having cast an experienced\r\neye at Maud, and found her pleasing, extended both hands, and observed,\r\n'Go the limit, kid.'\r\n\r\nAt any other time Maud might have resented being addressed as 'kid' by\r\na customer, but now she welcomed it. With the exception of a slight\r\nthickening of the lobe of one ear, Mr Shute bore no outward signs of\r\nhis profession. And being, to use his own phrase, a 'swell dresser', he\r\nwas really a most presentable young man. Just, in fact, what Maud\r\nneeded. She saw in him her last hope. If any faint spark of his ancient\r\nfire still lingered in Arthur, it was through Mr Shute that it must be\r\nfanned.\r\n\r\nShe smiled upon Mr Shute. She worked on his robust fingers as if it\r\nwere an artistic treat to be permitted to handle them. So carefully did\r\nshe toil that she was still busy when Arthur, taking off his apron and\r\nputting on his hat, went out for his twenty-minutes' lunch, leaving\r\nthem alone together.\r\n\r\nThe door had scarcely shut when Mr Shute bent forward.\r\n\r\n'Say!'\r\n\r\nHe sank his voice to a winning whisper.\r\n\r\n'You look good to muh,' he said, gallantly.\r\n\r\n'The idea!' said Maud, tossing her head.\r\n\r\n'On the level,' Mr Shute assured her.\r\n\r\nMaud laid down her orange-sticks.\r\n\r\n'Don't be silly,' she said. 'There--I've finished.'\r\n\r\n'I've not,' said Mr Shute. 'Not by a mile. Say!'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'What do you do with your evenings?'\r\n\r\n'I go home.'\r\n\r\n'Sure. But when you don't? It's a poor heart that never rejoices. Don't\r\nyou ever whoop it up?'\r\n\r\n'Whoop it up?'\r\n\r\n'The mad whirl,' explained Mr Shute. 'Ice-cream soda and buck-wheat\r\ncakes, and a happy evening at lovely Luna Park.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know where Luna Park is.'\r\n\r\n'What did they teach you at school? It's out in that direction,' said\r\nMr Shute, pointing over his shoulder. 'You go straight on about three\r\nthousand miles till you hit little old New York; then you turn to the\r\nright. Say, don't you ever get a little treat? Why not come along to\r\nthe White City some old evening? This evening?'\r\n\r\n'Mr Welsh is taking me to the White City tonight.'\r\n\r\n'And who is Mr Welsh?'\r\n\r\n'The gentleman who has just gone out.'\r\n\r\n'Is that so? Well, he doesn't look a live one, but maybe it's just\r\nbecause he's had bad news today. You never can tell.' He rose.\r\n'Farewell, Evelina, fairest of your sex. We shall meet again; so keep a\r\nstout heart.'\r\n\r\nAnd, taking up his cane, straw hat, and yellow gloves, Mr Shute\r\ndeparted, leaving Maud to her thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe was disappointed. She had expected better results. Mr Shute had\r\nlowered with ease the record for gay badinage, hitherto held by the\r\nred-faced customer; yet to all appearances there had been no change in\r\nArthur's manner. But perhaps he had scowled (or bitten his lip), and\r\nshe had not noticed it. Apparently he had struck Mr Shute, an unbiased\r\nspectator, as gloomy. Perhaps at some moment when her eyes had been on\r\nher work--She hoped for the best.\r\n\r\nWhatever his feelings may have been during the afternoon, Arthur was\r\nundeniably cheerful that evening. He was in excellent spirits. His\r\nlight-hearted abandon on the Wiggle-Woggle had been noted and commented\r\nupon by several lookers-on. Confronted with the Hairy Ainus, he had\r\ntouched a high level of facetiousness. And now, as he sat with her\r\nlistening to the band, he was crooning joyously to himself in\r\naccompaniment to the music, without, it would appear, a care in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMaud was hurt and anxious. In a mere acquaintance this blithe attitude\r\nwould have been welcome. It would have helped her to enjoy her evening.\r\nBut from Arthur at that particular moment she looked for something\r\nelse. Why was he cheerful? Only a few hours ago she had been--yes,\r\nflirting with another man before his very eyes. What right had he to be\r\ncheerful? He ought to be heated, full of passionate demands for an\r\nexplanation--a flushed, throaty thing to be coaxed back into a good\r\ntemper and then forgiven--all this at great length--for having been in\r\na bad one. Yes, she told herself, she had wanted certainty one way or\r\nthe other, and here it was. Now she knew. He no longer cared for her.\r\n\r\nShe trembled.\r\n\r\n'Cold?' said Arthur. 'Let's walk. Evenings beginning to draw in now.\r\nLum-da-diddley-ah. That's what I call a good tune. Give me something\r\nlively and bright. Dumty-umpty-iddley-ah. Dum tum--'\r\n\r\n'Funny thing--' said Maud, deliberately.\r\n\r\n'What's a funny thing?'\r\n\r\n'The gentleman in the brown suit whose hands I did this afternoon--'\r\n\r\n'He was,' agreed Arthur, brightly. 'A very funny thing.'\r\n\r\nMaud frowned. Wit at the expense of Hairy Ainus was one thing--at her\r\nown another.\r\n\r\n'I was about to say,' she went on precisely, 'that it was a funny\r\nthing, a coincidence, seeing that I was already engaged, that the\r\ngentleman in the brown suit whose hands I did this afternoon should\r\nhave asked me to come here, to the White City, with him tonight.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment they walked on in silence. To Maud it seemed a hopeful\r\nsilence. Surely it must be the prelude to an outburst.\r\n\r\n'Oh!' he said, and stopped.\r\n\r\nMaud's heart gave a leap. Surely that was the old tone?\r\n\r\nA couple of paces, and he spoke again.\r\n\r\n'I didn't hear him ask you.'\r\n\r\nHis voice was disappointingly level.\r\n\r\n'He asked me after you had gone out to lunch.'\r\n\r\n'It's a nuisance,' said Arthur, cheerily, 'when things clash like that.\r\nBut perhaps he'll ask you again. Nothing to prevent you coming here\r\ntwice. Well repays a second visit, I always say. I think--'\r\n\r\n'You shouldn't,' said a voice behind him. 'It hurts the head. Well,\r\nkid, being shown a good time?'\r\n\r\nThe possibility of meeting Mr Shute had not occurred to Maud. She had\r\nassumed that, being aware that she would be there with another, he\r\nwould have stayed away. It may, however, be remarked that she did not\r\nknow Mr Shute. He was not one of your sensitive plants. He smiled\r\npleasantly upon her, looking very dapper in evening dress and a silk\r\nhat that, though a size too small for him, shone like a mirror.\r\n\r\nMaud hardly knew whether she was glad or sorry to see him. It did not\r\nseem to matter much now either way. Nothing seemed to matter much, in\r\nfact. Arthur's cheery acceptance of the news that she received\r\ninvitations from others had been like a blow, leaving her numb and\r\nlistless.\r\n\r\nShe made the introductions. The two men eyed each other.\r\n\r\n'Pleased to meet you,' said Mr Shute.\r\n\r\n'Weather keeps up,' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nAnd from that point onward Mr Shute took command.\r\n\r\nIt is to be assumed that this was not the first time that Mr Shute had\r\nmade one of a trio in these circumstances, for the swift dexterity with\r\nwhich he lost Arthur was certainly not that of a novice. So smoothly\r\nwas it done that it was not until she emerged from the Witching Waves,\r\nguided by the pugilist's slim but formidable right arm, that Maud\r\nrealized that Arthur had gone.\r\n\r\nShe gave a little cry of dismay. Secretly she was beginning to be\r\nsomewhat afraid of Mr Shute. He was showing signs of being about to\r\nstep out of the role she had assigned to him and attempt something on a\r\nlarger scale. His manner had that extra touch of warmth which makes all\r\nthe difference.\r\n\r\n'Oh! He's gone!' she cried.\r\n\r\n'Sure,' said Mr Shute. 'He's got a hurry-call from the Uji Village.\r\nThe chief's cousin wants a hair-cut.'\r\n\r\n'We must find him. We must.'\r\n\r\n'Surest thing you know,' said Mr Shute. 'Plenty of time.'\r\n\r\n'We must find him.'\r\n\r\nMr Shute regarded her with some displeasure.\r\n\r\n'Seems to be ace-high with you, that dub,' he said.\r\n\r\n'I don't understand you.'\r\n\r\n'My observation was,' explained Mr Shute, coldly, 'that, judging from\r\nappearances, that dough-faced lemon was Willie-boy, the first and only\r\nlove.'\r\n\r\nMaud turned on him with flaming cheeks.\r\n\r\n'Mr Welsh is nothing to me! Nothing! Nothing!' she cried.\r\n\r\nShe walked quickly on.\r\n\r\n'Then, if there's a vacancy, star-eyes,' said the pugilist at her side,\r\nholding on a hat which showed a tendency to wobble, 'count me in.\r\nDirectly I saw you--see here, what's the idea of this road-work? We\r\naren't racing--'\r\n\r\nMaud slowed down.\r\n\r\n'That's better. As I was saying, directly I saw you, I said to myself,\r\n\"That's the one you need. The original candy kid. The--\"'\r\n\r\nHis hat lurched drunkenly as he answered the girl's increase of speed.\r\nHe cursed it in a brief aside.\r\n\r\n'That's what I said. \"The original candy kid.\" So--'\r\n\r\nHe shot out a restraining hand. 'Arthur!' cried Maud. 'Arthur!'\r\n\r\n'It's not my name' breathed Mr Shute, tenderly. 'Call me Clarence.'\r\n\r\nConsidered as an embrace, it was imperfect. At these moments a silk\r\nhat a size too small handicaps a man. The necessity of having to be\r\ncareful about the nap prevented Mr Shute from doing himself complete\r\njustice. But he did enough to induce Arthur Welsh, who, having sighted\r\nthe missing ones from afar, had been approaching them at a walking\r\npace, to substitute a run for the walk, and arrive just as Maud\r\nwrenched herself free.\r\n\r\nMr Shute took off his hat, smoothed it, replaced it with extreme care,\r\nand turned his attention to the new-comer.\r\n\r\n'Arthur!' said Maud.\r\n\r\nHer heart gave a great leap. There was no mistaking the meaning in the\r\neye that met hers. He cared! He cared!\r\n\r\n'Arthur!'\r\n\r\nHe took no notice. His face was pale and working. He strode up to Mr\r\nShute.\r\n\r\n'Well?' he said between his teeth.\r\n\r\nAn eight-stone-four champion of the world has many unusual experiences\r\nin his life, but he rarely encounters men who say 'Well?' to him\r\nbetween their teeth. Mr Shute eyed this freak with profound wonder.\r\n\r\n'I'll teach you to--to kiss young ladies!'\r\n\r\nMr Shute removed his hat again and gave it another brush. This gave him\r\nthe necessary time for reflection.\r\n\r\n'I don't need it,' he said. 'I've graduated.'\r\n\r\n'Put them up!' hissed Arthur.\r\n\r\nAlmost a shocked look spread itself over the pugilist's face. So might\r\nRaphael have looked if requested to draw a pavement-picture.\r\n\r\n'You aren't speaking to ME?' he said, incredulously.\r\n\r\n'Put them up!'\r\n\r\nMaud, trembling from head to foot, was conscious of one overwhelming\r\nemotion. She was terrified--yes. But stronger than the terror was the\r\ngreat wave of elation which swept over her. All her doubts had\r\nvanished. At last, after weary weeks of uncertainty, Arthur was about\r\nto give the supreme proof. He was going to joust for her.\r\n\r\nA couple of passers-by had paused, interested, to watch developments.\r\nYou could never tell, of course. Many an apparently promising row never\r\ngot any farther than words. But, glancing at Arthur's face, they\r\ncertainly felt justified in pausing. Mr Shute spoke.\r\n\r\n'If it wasn't,' he said, carefully, 'that I don't want trouble with the\r\nSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, I'd--'\r\n\r\nHe broke off, for, to the accompaniment of a shout of approval from the\r\ntwo spectators, Arthur had swung his right fist, and it had taken him\r\nsmartly on the side of the head.\r\n\r\nCompared with the blows Mr Shute was wont to receive in the exercise of\r\nhis profession, Arthur's was a gentle tap. But there was one\r\ncircumstance which gave it a deadliness all its own. Achilles had his\r\nheel. Mr Shute's vulnerable point was at the other extremity. Instead\r\nof countering, he uttered a cry of agony, and clutched wildly with both\r\nhands at his hat.\r\n\r\nHe was too late. It fell to the ground and bounded away, with its\r\nproprietor in passionate chase. Arthur snorted and gently chafed his\r\nknuckles.\r\n\r\nThere was a calm about Mr Shute's demeanour as, having given his\r\ntreasure a final polish and laid it carefully down, he began to advance\r\non his adversary, which was more than ominous. His lips were a thin\r\nline of steel. The muscles stood out over his jaw-bones. Crouching in\r\nhis professional manner, he moved forward softly, like a cat.\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this precise moment, just as the two spectators,\r\nreinforced now by eleven other men of sporting tastes, were\r\ncongratulating themselves on their acumen in having stopped to watch,\r\nthat Police-Constable Robert Bryce, intruding fourteen stones of bone\r\nand muscle between the combatants, addressed to Mr Shute these\r\nmemorable words: ''Ullo, 'ullo! 'Ullo, 'ullo, 'ul-_lo_!'\r\n\r\nMr Shute appealed to his sense of justice.\r\n\r\n'The mutt knocked me hat off.'\r\n\r\n'And I'd do it again,' said Arthur, truculently.\r\n\r\n'Not while I'm here you wouldn't, young fellow,' said Mr Bryce, with\r\ndecision. 'I'm surprised at you,' he went on, pained. 'And you look a\r\nrespectable young chap, too. You pop off.'\r\n\r\nA shrill voice from the crowd at this point offered the constable all\r\ncinematograph rights if he would allow the contest to proceed.\r\n\r\n'And you pop off, too, all of you,' continued Mr Bryce. 'Blest if I\r\nknow what kids are coming to nowadays. And as for you,' he said,\r\naddressing Mr Shute, 'all you've got to do is to keep that face of\r\nyours closed. That's what you've got to do. I've got my eye on you,\r\nmind, and if I catch you a-follerin' of him'--he jerked his thumb over\r\nhis shoulder at Arthur's departing figure--'I'll pinch you. Sure as\r\nyou're alive.' He paused. 'I'd have done it already,' he added,\r\npensively, 'if it wasn't me birthday.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArthur Welsh turned sharply. For some time he had been dimly aware that\r\nsomebody was calling his name.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Arthur!'\r\n\r\nShe was breathing quickly. He could see the tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n'I've been running. You walked so fast.'\r\n\r\nHe stared down at her gloomily.\r\n\r\n'Go away,' he said. 'I've done with you.'\r\n\r\nShe clutched at his coat.\r\n\r\n'Arthur, listen--listen! It's all a mistake. I thought you--you didn't\r\ncare for me any more, and I was miserable, and I wrote to the paper and\r\nasked what should I do, and they said I ought to test you and try and\r\nmake you jealous, and that that would relieve my apprehensions. And I\r\nhated it, but I did it, and you didn't seem to care till now. And you\r\nknow that there's nobody but you.'\r\n\r\n'You--The paper? What?' he stammered.\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, yes. I wrote to _Fireside Chat_, and Dr Cupid said that\r\nwhen jealousy flew out of the window indifference came in at the door,\r\nand that I must exhibit pleasure in the society of other gentlemen and\r\nmark your demeanour. So I--Oh!'\r\n\r\nArthur, luckier than Mr Shute, was not hampered by a too small silk\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nIt was a few moments later, as they moved slowly towards the\r\nFlip-Flap--which had seemed to both of them a fitting climax for\r\nthe evening's emotions--that Arthur, fumbling in his waist-coat pocket,\r\nproduced a small slip of paper.\r\n\r\n'What's that?' Maud asked.\r\n\r\n'Read it,' said Arthur. 'It's from _Home Moments_, in answer to a\r\nletter I sent them. And,' he added with heat, 'I'd like to have five\r\nminutes alone with the chap who wrote it.'\r\n\r\nAnd under the electric light Maud read\r\n\r\nANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS\r\n\r\n_By the Heart Specialist_\r\n\r\nArthur W.--Jealousy, Arthur W., is not only the most wicked, but the\r\nmost foolish of passions. Shakespeare says:\r\n\r\n _It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock\r\n           The meat it feeds on._\r\n\r\nYou admit that you have frequently caused great distress to the young\r\nlady of your affections by your exhibition of this weakness. Exactly.\r\nThere is nothing a girl dislikes or despises more than jealousy. Be a\r\nman, Arthur W. Fight against it. You may find it hard at first, but\r\npersevere. Keep a smiling face. If she seems to enjoy talking to other\r\nmen, show no resentment. Be merry and bright. Believe me, it is the\r\nonly way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ADVICE OF COUNSEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traveller champed meditatively at his steak. He paid no attention\r\nto the altercation which was in progress between the waiter and the man\r\nat the other end of the dingy room. The sounds of strife ceased. The\r\nwaiter came over to the traveller's table and stood behind his chair.\r\nHe was ruffled.\r\n\r\n'If he meant lamb,' he said, querulously, 'why didn't he say \"lamb\",\r\nso's a feller could hear him? I thought he said \"ham\", so I brought\r\nham. Now Lord Percy gets all peevish.'\r\n\r\nHe laughed bitterly. The traveller made no reply.\r\n\r\n'If people spoke distinct,' said the waiter, 'there wouldn't be half\r\nthe trouble there is in the world. Not half the trouble there wouldn't\r\nbe. I shouldn't be here, for one thing. In this restawrong, I mean.' A\r\nsigh escaped him.\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't,' he said, 'and that's the truth. I should be getting up\r\nwhen I pleased, eating and drinking all I wanted, and carrying on same\r\nas in the good old days. You wouldn't think, to look at me, would you\r\nnow, that I was once like the lily of the field?'\r\n\r\nThe waiter was a tall, stringy man, who gave the impression of having\r\nno spine. In that he drooped, he might have been said to resemble a\r\nflower, but in no other respect. He had sandy hair, weak eyes set close\r\ntogether, and a day's growth of red stubble on his chin. One could not\r\nsee him in the lily class.\r\n\r\n'What I mean to say is, I didn't toil, neither did I spin. Ah, them was\r\nhappy days! Lying on me back, plenty of tobacco, something cool in a\r\njug--'\r\n\r\nHe sighed once more.\r\n\r\n'Did you ever know a man of the name of Moore? Jerry Moore?'\r\n\r\nThe traveller applied himself to his steak in silence.\r\n\r\n'Nice feller. Simple sort of feller. Big. Quiet. Bit deaf in one ear.\r\nStraw-coloured hair. Blue eyes. 'Andsome, rather. Had a 'ouse just\r\noutside of Reigate. Has it still. Money of his own. Left him by his pa.\r\nSimple sort of feller. Not much to say for himself. I used to know him\r\nwell in them days. Used to live with him. Nice feller he was. Big. Bit\r\nhard of hearing. Got a sleepy kind of grin, like this--something.'\r\n\r\nThe traveller sipped his beer in thoughtful silence.\r\n\r\n'I reckon you never met him,' said the waiter. 'Maybe you never knew\r\nGentleman Bailey, either? We always called him that. He was one of\r\nthese broken-down Eton or 'Arrer fellers, folks said. We struck up a\r\npartnership kind of casual, both being on the tramp together, and after\r\na while we 'appened to be round about Reigate. And the first house we\r\ncome to was this Jerry Moore's. He come up just as we was sliding to\r\nthe back door, and grins that sleepy grin. Like this--something.\r\n\"'Ullo!\" he says. Gentleman kind of gives a whoop, and hollers, \"If it\r\nain't my old pal, Jerry Moore! Jack,\" he says to me, \"this is my old\r\npal, Mr Jerry Moore, wot I met in 'appier days down at Ramsgate one\r\nsummer.\"\r\n\r\n'They shakes hands, and Jerry Moore says, \"Is this a friend of yours,\r\nBailey?\" looking at me. Gentleman introduces me. \"We are partners,\" he\r\nsays, \"partners in misfortune. This is my friend, Mr Roach.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Come along in,\" says Jerry.\r\n\r\n'So we went in, and he makes us at home. He's a bachelor, and lives all\r\nby himself in this desirable 'ouse.\r\n\r\n'Well, I seen pretty quick that Jerry thinks the world of Gentleman.\r\nAll that evening he's acting as if he's as pleased as Punch to have\r\nhim there. Couldn't do enough for him. _It_ was a bit of _all_\r\nright, I said to meself. It was, too.\r\n\r\n'Next day we gets up late and has a good breakfast, and sits on the\r\nlawn and smokes. The sun was shining, the little birds was singing, and\r\nthere wasn't a thing, east, west, north, or south, that looked like\r\nwork. If I had been asked my address at that moment, on oath, I\r\nwouldn't have hesitated a second. I should have answered, \"No. 1, Easy\r\nStreet.\" You see, Jerry Moore was one of these slow, simple fellers,\r\nand you could tell in a moment what a lot he thought of Gentleman.\r\nGentleman, you see, had a way with him. Not haughty, he wasn't. More\r\naffable, I should call it. He sort of made you feel that all men are\r\nborn equal, but that it was awful good of him to be talking to you, and\r\nthat he wouldn't do it for everybody. It went down proper with Jerry\r\nMoore. Jerry would sit and listen to him giving his views on things by\r\nthe hour. By the end of the first day I was having visions of sitting\r\nin that garden a white-baked old man, and being laid out, when my time\r\nshould come, in Jerry's front room.'\r\n\r\nHe paused, his mind evidently in the past, among the cigars and big\r\nbreakfasts. Presently he took up his tale.\r\n\r\n'This here Jerry Moore was a simple sort of feller. Deafies are like\r\nthat. Ever noticed? Not that Jerry was a real deafy. His hearing was a\r\nbit off, but he could foller you if you spoke to him nice and clear.\r\nWell, I was saying, he was kind of simple. Liked to put in his days\r\npottering about the little garden he'd made for himself, looking after\r\nhis flowers and his fowls, and sit of an evening listening to Gentleman\r\n'olding forth on Life. He was a philosopher, Gentleman was. And Jerry\r\ntook everything he said as gospel. He didn't want no proofs. 'E and\r\nthe King of Denmark would have been great pals. He just sat by with his\r\nbig blue eyes getting rounder every minute and lapped it up.\r\n\r\n'Now you'd think a man like that could be counted on, wouldn't you?\r\nWould he want anything more? Not he, you'd say. You'd be wrong. Believe\r\nme, there isn't a man on earth that's fixed and contented but what a\r\nwoman can't knock his old Paradise into 'ash with one punch.\r\n\r\n'It wasn't long before I begin to notice a change in Jerry. He never\r\nhad been what you'd call a champion catch-as-catch-can talker, but now\r\nhe was silenter than ever. And he got a habit of switching Gentleman\r\noff from his theories on Life in general to Woman in particular. This\r\nsuited Gentleman just right. What he didn't know about Woman wasn't\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n'Gentleman was too busy talking to have time to get suspicious, but I\r\nwasn't; and one day I draws Gentleman aside and puts it to him\r\nstraight. \"Gentleman,\" I says, \"Jerry Moore is in love!\"\r\n\r\n'Well, this was a nasty knock, of course, for Gentleman. He knew as\r\nwell as I did what it would mean if Jerry was to lead home a blushing\r\nbride through that front door. It would be outside into the cold, hard\r\nworld for the bachelor friends. Gentleman sees that quick, and his jaw\r\ndrops. I goes on. \"All the time,\" I says, \"that you're talking away of\r\nan evening, Jerry's seeing visions of a little woman sitting in your\r\nchair. And you can bet we don't enter into them visions. He may dream\r\nof little feet pattering about the house,\" I says, \"but they aren't\r\nours; and you can 'ave something on that both ways. Look alive,\r\nGentleman,\" I says, \"and think out some plan, or we might as well be\r\npadding the hoof now.\"\r\n\r\n'Well, Gentleman did what he could. In his evening discourses he\r\nstarted to give it to Woman all he knew. Began to talk about Delilahs\r\nand Jezebels and Fools-there-was and the rest of it, and what a mug a\r\nfeller was to let a female into 'is cosy home, who'd only make him\r\nspend his days hooking her up, and his nights wondering how to get back\r\nthe blankets without waking her. My, he was crisp! Enough to have given\r\nRomeo the jumps, you'd have thought. But, lor! It's no good talking to\r\nthem when they've got it bad.\r\n\r\n'A few days later we caught him with the goods, talking in the road to\r\na girl in a pink dress.\r\n\r\n'I couldn't but admit that Jerry had picked one right from the top of\r\nthe basket. This wasn't one of them languishing sort wot sits about in\r\ncosy corners and reads story-books, and don't care what's happening in\r\nthe home so long as they find out what became of the hero in his duel\r\nwith the Grand Duke. She was a brown, slim, wiry-looking little thing.\r\n_You_ know. Held her chin up and looked you up and down with eyes\r\nthe colour of Scotch whisky, as much as to say, \"Well, what\r\n_about_ it?\" You could tell without looking at her, just by the\r\nfeel of the atmosphere when she was near, that she had as much snap and\r\ngo in her as Jerry Moore hadn't, which was a good bit. I knew, just as\r\nsure as I was standing there on one leg, that this was the sort of girl\r\nwho would have me and Gentleman out of that house about three seconds\r\nafter the clergyman had tied the knot.\r\n\r\n'Jerry says, \"These are my friends, Miss Tuxton--Mr Bailey and Mr\r\nRoach. They are staying with me for a visit. This is Miss Jane Tuxton,\"\r\nhe says to us. \"I was just going to see Miss Tuxton home,\" he says,\r\nsort of wistful. \"Excellent,\" says Gentleman. \"We'll come too.\" And we\r\nall goes along. There wasn't much done in the way of conversation.\r\nJerry never was one for pushing out the words; nor was I, when in the\r\npresence of the sect; and Miss Jane had her chin in the air, as if she\r\nthought me and Gentleman was not needed in any way whatsoever. The\r\nonly talk before we turned her in at the garden gate was done by\r\nGentleman, who told a pretty long story about a friend of his in Upper\r\nSydenham who had been silly enough to marry, and had had trouble ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n'That night, after we had went to bed, I said to Gentleman,\r\n\"Gentleman,\" I says, \"what's going to be done about this? We've got\r\nabout as much chance, if Jerry marries that girl,\" I says, \"as a couple\r\nof helpless chocolate creams at a school-girls' picnic.\" \"If,\" says\r\nGentleman. \"He ain't married her yet. That is a girl of character,\r\nJack. Trust me. Didn't she strike you as a girl who would like a man\r\nwith a bit of devil in him, a man with some go in him, a you-be-darned\r\nkind of man? Does Jerry fill the bill? He's more like a doormat with\r\n'Welcome' written on it, than anything else.\"\r\n\r\n'Well, we seen a good deal of Miss Jane in the next week or so. We\r\nkeeps Jerry under--what's it the heroine says in the melodrama? \"Oh,\r\ncruel, cruel, S.P. something.\" Espionage, that's it. We keeps Jerry\r\nunder espionage, and whenever he goes trickling round after the girl,\r\nwe goes trickling round after him.\r\n\r\n'\"Things is running our way,\" says Gentleman to me, after one of these\r\nmeetings. \"That girl is getting cross with Jerry. She wants Reckless\r\nRudolf, not a man who stands and grins when other men butt in on him\r\nand his girl. Mark my words, Jack. She'll get tired of Jerry, and go\r\noff and marry a soldier, and we'll live happy ever after.\" \"Think so?\"\r\nI says. \"Sure of it,\" said Gentleman.\r\n\r\n'It was the Sunday after this that Jerry Moore announces to us,\r\nwriggling, that he had an engagement to take supper with Jane and her\r\nfolks. He'd have liked to have slipped away secret, but we was keeping\r\nhim under espionage too crisp for that, so he has to tell us.\r\n\"Excellent,\" said Gentleman. \"It will be a great treat to Jack and\r\nmyself to meet the family. We will go along with you.\" So off we all\r\ngoes, and pushes our boots in sociable fashion under the Tuxton table.\r\nI looked at Miss Jane out of the corner of my eye; and, honest, that\r\nchin of hers was sticking out a foot, and Jerry didn't dare look at\r\nher. Love's young dream, I muses to myself, how swift it fades when a\r\nman has the nature and disposition of a lop-eared rabbit!\r\n\r\n'The Tuxtons was four in number, not counting the parrot, and all male.\r\nThere was Pa Tuxton, an old feller with a beard and glasses; a fat\r\nuncle; a big brother, who worked in a bank and was dressed like Moses\r\nin all his glory; and a little brother with a snub nose, that cheeky\r\nyou'd have been surprised. And the parrot in its cage and a fat yellow\r\ndog. And they're all making themselves pleasant to Jerry, the wealthy\r\nfuture son-in-law, something awful. It's \"How are the fowls, Mr\r\nMoore?\" and \"A little bit of this pie, Mr Moore; Jane made it,\" and\r\nJerry sitting there with a feeble grin, saying \"Yes\" and \"No\" and\r\nnothing much more, while Miss Jane's eyes are snapping like Fifth of\r\nNovember fireworks. I could feel Jerry's chances going back a mile a\r\nminute. I felt as happy as a little child that evening. I sang going\r\nback home.\r\n\r\n'Gentleman's pleased, too. \"Jack,\" he says to me when we're in bed,\r\n\"this is too easy. In my most sanguinary dreams I hardly hoped for\r\nthis. No girl of spirit's going to love a man who behaves that way to\r\nher parents. The way to win the heart of a certain type of girl,\" he\r\nsays, beginning on his theories, \"the type to which Jane Tuxton\r\nbelongs, is to be rude to her family. I've got Jane Tuxton sized up and\r\nlabelled. Her kind wants her folks to dislike her young man. She wants\r\nto feel that she's the only one in the family that's got the sense to\r\nsee the hidden good in Willie. She doesn't want to be one of a crowd\r\nhollering out what a nice young man he is. It takes some pluck in a man\r\nto stand up to a girl's family, and that's what Jane Tuxton is looking\r\nfor in Jerry. Take it from one who has studied the sect,\" says\r\nGentleman, \"from John o' Groat's to Land's End, and back again.\"\r\n\r\n'Next day Jerry Moore's looking as if he'd only sixpence in the world\r\nand had swallowed it. \"What's the matter, Jerry?\" says Gentleman. Jerry\r\nheaves a sigh. \"Bailey,\" he says, \"and you, Mr Roach, I expect you both\r\nseen how it is with me. I love Miss Jane Tuxton, and you seen for\r\nyourselves what transpires. She don't value me, not tuppence.\" \"Say not\r\nso,\" says Gentleman, sympathetic. \"You're doing fine. If you knew the\r\nsect as I do you wouldn't go by mere superficial silences and\r\nchin-tiltings. I can read a girl's heart, Jerry,\" he says, patting him\r\non the shoulder, \"and I tell you you're doing fine. All you want now\r\nis a little rapid work, and you win easy. To make the thing a cert,\"\r\nhe says, getting up, \"all you have to do is to make a dead set at her\r\nfolks.\" He winks at me. \"Don't just sit there like you did last night.\r\nShow 'em you've got something in you. You know what folks are: they\r\nthink themselves the most important things on the map. Well, go to\r\nwork. Consult them all you know. Every opportunity you get. There's\r\nnothing like consulting a girl's folks to put you in good with her.\"\r\nAnd he pats Jerry on the shoulder again and goes indoors to find his\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n'Jerry turns to me. \"Do you think that's really so?\" he says. I says,\r\n\"I do.\" \"He knows all about girls, I reckon,\" says Jerry. \"You can go\r\nby him every time,\" I says. \"Well, well,\" says Jerry, sort of\r\nthoughtful.'\r\n\r\nThe waiter paused. His eye was sad and dreamy. Then he took up the\r\nburden of his tale.\r\n\r\n'First thing that happens is that Gentleman has a sore tooth on the\r\nnext Sunday, so don't feel like coming along with us. He sits at home,\r\ndosing it with whisky, and Jerry and me goes off alone.\r\n\r\n'So Jerry and me pikes off, and once more we prepares to settle down\r\naround the board. I hadn't noticed Jerry particular, but just now I\r\ncatches sight of his face in the light of the lamp. Ever see one of\r\nthose fighters when he's sitting in his corner before a fight, waiting\r\nfor the gong to go? Well, Jerry looks like that; and it surprises me.\r\n\r\n'I told you about the fat yellow dog that permeated the Tuxton's\r\nhouse, didn't I? The family thought a lot of that dog, though of all\r\nthe ugly brutes I ever met he was the worst. Sniffing round and\r\ngrowling all the time. Well, this evening he comes up to Jerry just as\r\nhe's going to sit down, and starts to growl. Old Pa Tuxton looks over\r\nhis glasses and licks his tongue. \"Rover! Rover!\" he says, kind of\r\nmild. \"Naughty Rover; he don't like strangers, I'm afraid.\" Jerry looks\r\nat Pa Tuxton, and he looks at the dog, and I'm just expecting him to\r\nsay \"No\" or \"Yes\", same as the other night, when he lets out a nasty\r\nlaugh--one of them bitter laughs. \"Ho!\" he says. \"Ho! don't he? Then\r\nperhaps he'd better get further away from them.\" And he ups with his\r\nboot and--well, the dog hit the far wall.\r\n\r\n'Jerry sits down and pulls up his chair. \"I don't approve,\" he says,\r\nfierce, \"of folks keeping great, fat, ugly, bad-tempered yellow dogs\r\nthat are a nuisance to all. I don't like it.\"\r\n\r\n'There was a silence you could have scooped out with a spoon. Have you\r\never had a rabbit turn round on you and growl? That's how we all felt\r\nwhen Jerry outs with them crisp words. They took our breath away.\r\n\r\n'While we were getting it back again the parrot, which was in its cage,\r\nlet out a squawk. Honest, I jumped a foot in my chair.\r\n\r\n'Jerry gets up very deliberate, and walks over to the parrot. \"Is\r\nthis a menagerie?\" he says. \"Can't a man have supper in peace without\r\nan image like you starting to holler? Go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n'We was all staring at him surprised, especially Uncle Dick Tuxton,\r\nwhose particular pet the parrot was. He'd brought him home all the way\r\nfrom some foreign parts.\r\n\r\n'\"Hello, Billy!\" says the bird, shrugging his shoulders and puffing\r\nhimself up. \"R-r-r-r! R-r-r-r! 'lo, Billy! 'lo, 'lo, 'lo! R-r WAH!\"\r\n\r\n'Jerry gives its cage a bang.\r\n\r\n'\"Don't talk back at me,\" he says, \"or I'll knock your head off. You\r\nthink because you've got a green tail you're someone.\" And he stalks\r\nback to his chair and sits glaring at Uncle Dick.\r\n\r\n'Well, all this wasn't what you might call promoting an easy flow of\r\nconversation. Everyone's looking at Jerry, 'specially me, wondering\r\nwhat next, and trying to get their breath, and Jerry's frowning at the\r\ncold beef, and there's a sort of awkward pause. Miss Jane is the first\r\nto get busy. She bustles about and gets the food served out, and we\r\nbegins to eat. But still there's not so much conversation that you'd\r\nnotice it. This goes on till we reaches the concluding stages, and then\r\nUncle Dick comes up to the scratch.\r\n\r\n'\"How is the fowls, Mr Moore?\" he says.\r\n\r\n'\"Gimme some more pie,\" says Jerry. \"What?\"\r\n\r\n'Uncle Dick repeats his remark.\r\n\r\n'\"Fowls?\" says Jerry. \"What do you know about fowls? Your notion of a\r\nfowl is an ugly bird with a green tail, a Wellington nose, and--gimme a\r\nbit of cheese.\"\r\n\r\n'Uncle Dick's fond of the parrot, so he speaks up for him. \"Polly's\r\nalways been reckoned a handsome bird,\" he says.\r\n\r\n'\"He wants stuffing,\" says Jerry.\r\n\r\n'And Uncle Dick drops out of the talk.\r\n\r\n'Up comes big brother, Ralph his name was. He's the bank-clerk and a\r\ndude. He gives his cuffs a flick, and starts in to make things jolly\r\nall round by telling a story about a man he knows named Wotherspoon.\r\nJerry fixes him with his eye, and, half-way through, interrupts.\r\n\r\n'\"That waistcoat of yours is fierce,\" he says.\r\n\r\n'\"Pardon?\" says Ralph.\r\n\r\n'\"That waistcoat of yours,\" says Jerry. \"It hurts me eyes. It's like an\r\nelectric sign.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Why, Jerry,\" I says, but he just scowls at me and I stops.\r\n\r\n'Ralph is proud of his clothes, and he isn't going to stand this. He\r\nglares at Jerry and Jerry glares at him.\r\n\r\n'\"Who do you think you are?\" says Ralph, breathing hard.\r\n\r\n'\"Button up your coat,\" says Jerry.\r\n\r\n'\"Look 'ere!\" says Ralph.\r\n\r\n'\"Cover it up, I tell you,\" says Jerry. \"Do you want to blind me?\" Pa\r\nTuxton interrupts.\r\n\r\n'\"Why, Mr Moore,\" he begins, sort of soothing; when the small brother,\r\nwho's been staring at Jerry, chips in. I told you he was cheeky.\r\n\r\n'He says, \"Pa, what a funny nose Mr Moore's got!\"\r\n\r\n'And that did it. Jerry rises, very slow, and leans across the table\r\nand clips the kid brother one side of the ear-'ole. And then there's a\r\ngeneral imbroglio, everyone standing up and the kid hollering and the\r\ndog barking.\r\n\r\n'\"If you'd brought him up better,\" says Jerry, severe, to Pa Tuxton,\r\n\"this wouldn't ever have happened.\"\r\n\r\nPa Tuxton gives a sort of howl.\r\n\r\n'\"Mr Moore,\" he yells, \"what is the meaning of this extraordinary\r\nbehaviour? You come here and strike me child--\"\r\n\r\n'Jerry bangs on the table.\r\n\r\n'\"Yes,\" he says, \"and I'd strike him again. Listen to me,\" he says. \"You\r\nthink just because I'm quiet I ain't got no spirit. You think all I can\r\ndo is to sit and smile. You think--Bah! You aren't on to the hidden\r\ndepths in me character. I'm one of them still waters that runs deep.\r\nI'm--Here, you get out of it! Yes, all of you! Except Jane. Jane and me\r\nwants this room to have a private talk in. I've got a lot of things to\r\nsay to Jane. Are you going?\"\r\n\r\n'I turns to the crowd. I was awful disturbed. \"You mustn't take any\r\nnotice,\" I says. \"He ain't well. He ain't himself.\" When just then the\r\nparrot cuts with another of them squawks. Jerry jumps at it.\r\n\r\n'\"You first,\" he says, and flings the cage out of the window. \"Now\r\nyou,\" he says to the yellow dog, putting him out through the door. And\r\nthen he folds his arms and scowls at us, and we all notice suddenly\r\nthat he's very big. We look at one another, and we begins to edge\r\ntowards the door. All except Jane, who's staring at Jerry as if he's a\r\nghost.\r\n\r\n'\"Mr Moore,\" says Pa Tuxton, dignified, \"we'll leave you. You're\r\ndrunk.\"\r\n\r\n'\"I'm not drunk,\" says Jerry. \"I'm in love.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Jane,\" says Pa Tuxton, \"come with me, and leave this ruffian to\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Jane,\" says Jerry, \"stop here, and come and lay your head on my\r\nshoulder.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Jane,\" says Pa Tuxton, \"do you hear me?\"\r\n\r\n'\"Jane,\" says Jerry, \"I'm waiting.\"\r\n\r\n'She looks from one to the other for a spell, and then she moves to\r\nwhere Jerry's standing.\r\n\r\n'\"I'll stop,\" she says, sort of quiet.\r\n\r\n'And we drifts out.'\r\n\r\nThe waiter snorted.\r\n\r\n'I got back home quick as I could,' he said, 'and relates the\r\nproceedings to Gentleman. Gentleman's rattled. \"I don't believe it,\" he\r\nsays. \"Don't stand there and tell me Jerry Moore did them things. Why,\r\nit ain't in the man. 'Specially after what I said to him about the way\r\nhe ought to behave. How could he have done so?\" Just then in comes\r\nJerry, beaming all over. \"Boys,\" he shouts, \"congratulate me. It's all\r\nright. We've fixed it up. She says she hadn't known me properly before.\r\nShe says she'd always reckoned me a sheep, while all the time I was one\r\nof them strong, silent men.\" He turns to Gentleman--'\r\n\r\nThe man at the other end of the room was calling for his bill.\r\n\r\n'All right, all right,' said the waiter. 'Coming! He turns to\r\nGentleman,' he went on rapidly, 'and he says, \"Bailey, I owe it all to\r\nyou, because if you hadn't told me to insult her folks--\"'\r\n\r\nHe leaned on the traveller's table and fixed him with an eye that\r\npleaded for sympathy.\r\n\r\n''Ow about that?' he said. 'Isn't that crisp? \"Insult her folks!\" Them\r\nwas his very words. \"Insult her folks.\"'\r\n\r\nThe traveller looked at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n'Can you beat it?' said the waiter.\r\n\r\n'I don't know what you are saying,' said the traveller. 'If it is\r\nimportant, write it on a slip of paper. I am stone-deaf.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGH-HEW THEM HOW WE WILL\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Boielle was a waiter. The word 'waiter' suggests a soft-voiced,\r\ndeft-handed being, moving swiftly and without noise in an atmosphere of\r\nluxury and shaded lamps. At Bredin's Parisian Cafe and Restaurant in\r\nSoho, where Paul worked, there were none of these things; and Paul\r\nhimself, though he certainly moved swiftly, was by no means noiseless.\r\nHis progress through the room resembled in almost equal proportions the\r\nfinish of a Marathon race, the star-act of a professional juggler, and\r\na monologue by an Earl's Court side-showman. Constant acquaintance\r\nrendered regular habitues callous to the wonder, but to a stranger the\r\nsight of Paul tearing over the difficult between-tables course, his\r\nhands loaded with two vast pyramids of dishes, shouting as he went the\r\nmystic word, 'Comingsarecominginamomentsaresteaksareyessarecomingsare!'\r\nwas impressive to a degree. For doing far less exacting feats on the\r\nstage music-hall performers were being paid fifty pounds a week. Paul\r\ngot eighteen shillings.\r\n\r\nWhat a blessing is poverty, properly considered. If Paul had received\r\nmore than eighteen shillings a week he would not have lived in an\r\nattic. He would have luxuriated in a bed-sitting-room on the second\r\nfloor; and would consequently have missed what was practically a\r\ngenuine north light. The skylight which went with the attic was so\r\narranged that the room was a studio in miniature, and, as Paul was\r\nengaged in his spare moments in painting a great picture, nothing could\r\nhave been more fortunate; for Paul, like so many of our public men,\r\nlived two lives. Off duty, the sprinting, barking juggler of Bredin's\r\nParisian Cafe became the quiet follower of Art. Ever since his\r\nchildhood he had had a passion for drawing and painting. He regretted\r\nthat Fate had allowed him so little time for such work; but after all,\r\nhe reflected, all great artists had had their struggles--so why not\r\nhe? Moreover, they were now nearly at an end. An hour here, an hour\r\nthere, and every Thursday a whole afternoon, and the great picture was\r\nwithin measurable distance of completion. He had won through. Without\r\nmodels, without leisure, hungry, tired, he had nevertheless triumphed.\r\nA few more touches, and the masterpiece would be ready for purchase. And\r\nafter that all would be plain sailing. Paul could forecast the scene so\r\nexactly. The picture would be at the dealer's, possibly--one must not\r\nbe too sanguine--thrust away in some odd corner. The wealthy\r\nconnoisseur would come in. At first he would not see the masterpiece;\r\nother more prominently displayed works would catch his eye. He would\r\nturn from them in weary scorn, and then!... Paul wondered how big the\r\ncheque would be.\r\n\r\nThere were reasons why he wanted the money. Looking at him as he\r\ncantered over the linoleum at Bredin's, you would have said that his\r\nmind was on his work. But it was not so. He took and executed orders as\r\nautomatically as the penny-in-the-slot musical-box in the corner took\r\npennies and produced tunes. His thoughts were of Jeanne Le Brocq, his\r\nco-worker at Bredin's, and a little cigar shop down Brixton way which\r\nhe knew was in the market at a reasonable rate. To marry the former and\r\nown the latter was Paul's idea of the earthly paradise, and it was the\r\nwealthy connoisseur, and he alone, who could open the gates.\r\n\r\nJeanne was a large, slow-moving Norman girl, stolidly handsome. One\r\ncould picture her in a de Maupassant farmyard. In the clatter and\r\nbustle of Bredin's Parisian Cafe she appeared out of place, like a cow\r\nin a boiler-factory. To Paul, who worshipped her with all the fervour\r\nof a little man for a large woman, her deliberate methods seemed all\r\nthat was beautiful and dignified. To his mind she lent a tone to the\r\nvulgar whirlpool of gorging humanity, as if she had been some goddess\r\nmixing in a Homeric battle. The whirlpool had other views--and\r\nexpressed them. One coarse-fibred brute, indeed, once went so far as to\r\naddress to her the frightful words, ''Urry up, there, Tottie! Look\r\nslippy.' It was wrong, of course, for Paul to slip and spill an order\r\nof scrambled eggs down the brute's coat-sleeve, but who can blame him?\r\n\r\nAmong those who did not see eye to eye with Paul in his views on\r\ndeportment in waitresses was M. Bredin himself, the owner of the\r\nParisian Cafe; and it was this circumstance which first gave Paul the\r\nopportunity of declaring the passion which was gnawing him with the\r\nfierce fury of a Bredin customer gnawing a tough steak against time\r\nduring the rush hour. He had long worshipped her from afar, but nothing\r\nmore intimate than a 'Good morning, Miss Jeanne', had escaped him,\r\ntill one day during a slack spell he came upon her in the little\r\npassage leading to the kitchen, her face hidden in her apron, her back\r\njerking with sobs.\r\n\r\nBusiness is business. Paul had a message to deliver to the cook\r\nrespecting 'two fried, coffee, and one stale'. He delivered it and\r\nreturned. Jeanne was still sobbing.\r\n\r\n'Ah, Miss Jeanne,' cried Paul, stricken, 'what is the matter? What is\r\nit? Why do you weep?'\r\n\r\n'The _patron_,' sobbed Jeanne. 'He--'\r\n\r\n'My angel,' said Paul, 'he is a pig.'\r\n\r\nThis was perfectly true. No conscientious judge of character could have\r\ndenied that Paul had hit the bull's eye. Bredin was a pig. He looked\r\nlike a pig; he ate like a pig; he grunted like a pig. He had the lavish\r\nembonpoint of a pig. Also a porcine soul. If you had tied a bit of blue\r\nribbon round his neck you could have won prizes with him at a show.\r\n\r\nPaul's eyes flashed with fury. 'I will slap him in the eye,' he roared.\r\n\r\n'He called me a tortoise.'\r\n\r\n'And kick him in the stomach,' added Paul.\r\n\r\nJeanne's sobs were running on second speed now. The anguish was\r\ndiminishing. Paul took advantage of the improved conditions to slide an\r\narm part of the way round her waist. In two minutes he had said as much\r\nas the ordinary man could have worked off in ten. All good stuff, too.\r\nNo padding.\r\n\r\nJeanne's face rose from her apron like a full moon. She was too\r\nastounded to be angry.\r\n\r\nPaul continued to babble. Jeanne looked at him with growing wrath. That\r\nshe, who received daily the affectionate badinage of gentlemen in\r\nbowler hats and check suits, who had once been invited to the White\r\nCity by a solicitor's clerk, should be addressed in this way by a\r\nwaiter! It was too much. She threw off his hand.\r\n\r\n'Wretched little man!' she cried, stamping angrily.\r\n\r\n'My angel!' protested Paul.\r\n\r\nJeanne uttered a scornful laugh.\r\n\r\n'You!' she said.\r\n\r\nThere are few more withering remarks than 'You!' spoken in a certain\r\nway. Jeanne spoke it in just that way.\r\n\r\nPaul wilted.\r\n\r\n'On eighteen shillings a week,' went on Jeanne, satirically, 'you would\r\nsupport a wife, yes? Why--'\r\n\r\nPaul recovered himself. He had an opening now, and proceeded to use it.\r\n\r\n'Listen,' he said. 'At present, yes, it is true, I earn but eighteen\r\nshillings a week, but it will not always be so, no. I am not only a\r\nwaiter. I am also an artist. I have painted a great picture. For a\r\nwhole year I have worked, and now it is ready. I will sell it, and\r\nthen, my angel--?'\r\n\r\nJeanne's face had lost some of its scorn. She was listening with some\r\nrespect. 'A picture?' she said, thoughtfully. 'There is money in\r\npictures.'\r\n\r\nFor the first time Paul was glad that his arm was no longer round her\r\nwaist. To do justice to the great work he needed both hands for\r\npurposes of gesticulation.\r\n\r\n'There is money in this picture,' he said. 'Oh, it is beautiful. I call\r\nit \"The Awakening\". It is a woodland scene. I come back from my work\r\nhere, hot and tired, and a mere glance at that wood refreshes me. It is\r\nso cool, so green. The sun filters in golden splashes through the\r\nfoliage. On a mossy bank, between two trees, lies a beautiful girl\r\nasleep. Above her, bending fondly over her, just about to kiss that\r\nflower-like face, is a young man in the dress of a shepherd. At the\r\nlast moment he has looked over his shoulder to make sure that there is\r\nnobody near to see. He is wearing an expression so happy, so proud,\r\nthat one's heart goes out to him.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, there might be money in that,' cried Jeanne.\r\n\r\n'There is, there is!' cried Paul. 'I shall sell it for many francs to a\r\nwealthy connoisseur. And then, my angel--'\r\n\r\n'You are a good little man,' said the angel, patronizingly. 'Perhaps.\r\nWe will see.'\r\n\r\nPaul caught her hand and kissed it. She smiled indulgently. 'Yes,' she\r\nsaid. 'There might be money. These English pay much money for pictures.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is pretty generally admitted that Geoffrey Chaucer, the eminent poet\r\nof the fourteenth century, though obsessed with an almost Rooseveltian\r\npassion for the new spelling, was there with the goods when it came to\r\nprofundity of thought. It was Chaucer who wrote the lines:\r\n\r\nThe lyfe so short, the craft so long to lerne,\r\nTh' assay so hard, so sharpe the conquering.\r\n\r\nWhich means, broadly, that it is difficult to paint a picture, but a\r\ngreat deal more difficult to sell it.\r\n\r\nAcross the centuries Paul Boielle shook hands with Geoffrey Chaucer.\r\n'So sharpe the conquering' put his case in a nutshell.\r\n\r\nThe full story of his wanderings with the masterpiece would read like\r\nan Odyssey and be about as long. It shall be condensed.\r\n\r\nThere was an artist who dined at intervals at Bredin's Parisian Cafe,\r\nand, as the artistic temperament was too impatient to be suited by\r\nJeanne's leisurely methods, it had fallen to Paul to wait upon him. It\r\nwas to this expert that Paul, emboldened by the geniality of the\r\nartist's manner, went for information. How did monsieur sell his\r\npictures? Monsieur said he didn't, except once in a blue moon. But when\r\nhe did? Oh, he took the thing to the dealers. Paul thanked him. A\r\nfriend of him, he explained, had painted a picture and wished to sell\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'Poor devil!' was the artist's comment.\r\n\r\nNext day, it happening to be a Thursday, Paul started on his travels.\r\nHe started buoyantly, but by evening he was as a punctured balloon.\r\nEvery dealer had the same remark to make--to wit, no room.\r\n\r\n'Have you yet sold the picture?' inquired Jeanne, when they met. 'Not\r\nyet,' said Paul. 'But they are delicate matters, these negotiations. I\r\nuse finesse. I proceed with caution.'\r\n\r\nHe approached the artist again.\r\n\r\n'With the dealers,' he said, 'my friend has been a little unfortunate.\r\nThey say they have no room.'\r\n\r\n'_I_ know,' said the artist, nodding.\r\n\r\n'Is there, perhaps, another way?'\r\n\r\n'What sort of a picture is it?' inquired the artist.\r\n\r\nPaul became enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n'Ah! monsieur, it is beautiful. It is a woodland scene. A beautiful\r\ngirl--'\r\n\r\n'Oh! Then he had better try the magazines. They might use it for a\r\ncover.'\r\n\r\nPaul thanked him effusively. On the following Thursday he visited\r\ndivers art editors. The art editors seemed to be in the same unhappy\r\ncondition as the dealers. 'Overstocked!' was their cry.\r\n\r\n'The picture?' said Jeanne, on the Friday morning. 'Is it sold?'\r\n\r\n'Not yet,' said Paul, 'but--'\r\n\r\n'Always but!'\r\n\r\n'My angel!'\r\n\r\n'Bah!' said Jeanne, with a toss of her large but shapely head.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the month Paul was fighting in the last ditch, wandering\r\ndisconsolately among those who dwell in outer darkness and have grimy\r\nthumbs. Seven of these in all he visited on that black Thursday, and\r\neach of the seven rubbed the surface of the painting with a grimy\r\nthumb, snorted, and dismissed him. Sick and beaten, Paul took the\r\nmasterpiece back to his skylight room.\r\n\r\nAll that night he lay awake, thinking. It was a weary bundle of nerves\r\nthat came to the Parisian Cafe next morning. He was late in arriving,\r\nwhich was good in that it delayed the inevitable question as to the\r\nfate of the picture, but bad in every other respect. M. Bredin,\r\nsquatting behind the cash-desk, grunted fiercely at him; and, worse,\r\nJeanne, who, owing to his absence, had had to be busier than suited her\r\ndisposition, was distant and haughty. A murky gloom settled upon Paul.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that M. Bredin, when things went well with him, was\r\nwont to be filled with a ponderous amiability. It was not often that\r\nthis took a practical form, though it is on record that in an exuberant\r\nmoment he once gave a small boy a halfpenny. More frequently it merely\r\nled him to soften the porcine austerity of his demeanour. Today,\r\nbusiness having been uncommonly good, he felt pleased with the world.\r\nHe had left his cash-desk and was assailing a bowl of soup at one of\r\nthe side-tables. Except for a belated luncher at the end of the room\r\nthe place was empty. It was one of the hours when there was a lull in\r\nthe proceedings at the Parisian Cafe. Paul was leaning, wrapped in the\r\ngloom, against the wall. Jeanne was waiting on the proprietor.\r\n\r\nM. Bredin finished his meal and rose. He felt content. All was well\r\nwith the world. As he lumbered to his desk he passed Jeanne. He\r\nstopped. He wheezed a compliment. Then another. Paul, from his place by\r\nthe wall, watched with jealous fury.\r\n\r\nM. Bredin chucked Jeanne under the chin.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, the belated luncher called 'Waiter!' but Paul was\r\notherwise engaged. His entire nervous system seemed to have been\r\nstirred up with a pole. With a hoarse cry he dashed forward. He would\r\ndestroy this pig who chucked his Jeanne under the chin.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation M. Bredin had of the declaration of war was the\r\nimpact of a French roll on his ear. It was one of those nobbly, chunky\r\nrolls with sharp corners, almost as deadly as a piece of shrapnel. M.\r\nBredin was incapable of jumping, but he uttered a howl and his vast\r\nbody quivered like a stricken jelly. A second roll, whizzing by,\r\nslapped against the wall. A moment later a cream-bun burst in sticky\r\nruin on the proprietor's left eye.\r\n\r\nThe belated luncher had been anxious to pay his bill and go, but he\r\ncame swiftly to the conclusion that this was worth stopping on for. He\r\nleaned back in his chair and watched. M. Bredin had entrenched himself\r\nbehind the cash-desk, peering nervously at Paul through the cream, and\r\nPaul, pouring forth abuse in his native tongue, was brandishing a\r\nchocolate eclair. The situation looked good to the spectator.\r\n\r\nIt was spoiled by Jeanne, who seized Paul by the arm and shook him,\r\nadding her own voice to the babel. It was enough. The eclair fell to\r\nthe floor. Paul's voice died away. His face took on again its crushed,\r\nhunted expression. The voice of M. Bredin, freed from competition, rose\r\nshrill and wrathful.\r\n\r\n'The marksman is getting sacked,' mused the onlooker, diagnosing the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nHe was right. The next moment Paul, limp and depressed, had retired to\r\nthe kitchen passage, discharged. It was here, after a few minutes, that\r\nJeanne found him.\r\n\r\n'Fool! Idiot! Imbecile!' said Jeanne.\r\n\r\nPaul stared at her without speaking.\r\n\r\n'To throw rolls at the _patron_. Imbecile!'\r\n\r\n'He--' began Paul.\r\n\r\n'Bah! And what if he did? Must you then attack him like a mad dog? What\r\nis it to you?'\r\n\r\nPaul was conscious of a dull longing for sympathy, a monstrous sense\r\nof oppression. Everything was going wrong. Surely Jeanne must be\r\ntouched by his heroism? But no. She was scolding furiously. Suppose\r\nAndromeda had turned and scolded Perseus after he had slain the\r\nsea-monster! Paul mopped his forehead with his napkin. The bottom had\r\ndropped out of his world.\r\n\r\n'Jeanne!'\r\n\r\n'Bah! Do not talk to me, idiot of a little man. Almost you lost me my\r\nplace also. The _patron_ was in two minds. But I coaxed him. A\r\nfine thing that would have been, to lose my good place through your\r\nfoolishness. To throw rolls. My goodness!'\r\n\r\nShe swept back into the room again, leaving Paul still standing by the\r\nkitchen door. Something seemed to have snapped inside him. How long he\r\nstood there he did not know, but presently from the dining-room came\r\ncalls of 'Waiter!' and automatically he fell once more into his work,\r\nas an actor takes up his part. A stranger would have noticed nothing\r\nremarkable in him. He bustled to and fro with undiminished energy.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day M. Bredin paid him his eighteen shillings with a\r\ngrunt, and Paul walked out of the restaurant a masterless man.\r\n\r\nHe went to his attic and sat down on the bed. Propped up against the\r\nwall was the picture. He looked at it with unseeing eyes. He stared\r\ndully before him.\r\n\r\nThen thoughts came to him with a rush, leaping and dancing in his mind\r\nlike imps in Hades. He had a curious sense of detachment. He seemed to\r\nbe watching himself from a great distance.\r\n\r\nThis was the end. The little imps danced and leaped; and then one\r\nseparated itself from the crowd, to grow bigger than, the rest, to\r\npirouette more energetically. He rose. His mind was made up. He would\r\nkill himself.\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs and out into the street. He thought hard as he\r\nwalked. He would kill himself, but how?\r\n\r\nHis preoccupation was so great that an automobile, rounding a corner,\r\nmissed him by inches as he crossed the road. The chauffeur shouted\r\nangrily at him as he leapt back.\r\n\r\nPaul shook his fist at the retreating lights.\r\n\r\n'Pig!' he shouted. 'Assassin! Scoundrel! Villain! Would you kill me? I\r\nwill take your number, rascal. I will inform the police. Villain!'\r\n\r\nA policeman had strolled up and was eyeing him curiously. Paul turned\r\nto him, full of his wrongs.\r\n\r\n'Officer,' he cried, 'I have a complaint. These pigs of chauffeurs!\r\nThey are reckless. They drive so recklessly. Hence the great number of\r\naccidents.'\r\n\r\n'Awful!' said the policeman. 'Pass along, sonny.'\r\n\r\nPaul walked on, fuming. It was abominable that these chauffeurs--And\r\nthen an idea came to him. He had found a way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was quiet in the Park. He had chosen the Park because it was dark\r\nand there would be none to see and interfere. He waited long in the\r\nshadow by the roadside. Presently from the darkness there came the\r\ndistant drone of powerful engines. Lights appeared, like the blazing\r\neyes of a dragon swooping down to devour its prey.\r\n\r\nHe ran out into the road with a shout.\r\n\r\nIt was an error, that shout. He had intended it for an inarticulate\r\nfarewell to his picture, to Jeanne, to life. It was excusable to the\r\ndriver of the motor that he misinterpreted it. It seemed to him a cry\r\nof warning. There was a great jarring of brakes, a scuttering of locked\r\nwheels on the dry road, and the car came to a standstill a full yard\r\nfrom where he stood.\r\n\r\n'What the deuce--' said a cool voice from behind the lights.\r\n\r\nPaul struck his chest and folded his arms.\r\n\r\n'I am here,' he cried. 'Destroy me!'\r\n\r\n'Let George do it,' said the voice, in a marked American accent. 'I\r\nnever murder on a Friday; it's unlucky. If it's not a rude question,\r\nwhich asylum are you from? Halloa!'\r\n\r\nThe exclamation was one of surprise, for Paul's nerves had finally\r\ngiven way, and he was now in a heap on the road, sobbing.\r\n\r\nThe man climbed down and came into the light. He was a tall young man\r\nwith a pleasant, clean-cut face. He stopped and shook Paul.\r\n\r\n'Quit that,' he said. 'Maybe it's not true. And if it is, there's\r\nalways hope. Cut it out. What's the matter? All in?'\r\n\r\nPaul sat up, gulping convulsively. He was thoroughly unstrung. The\r\ncold, desperate mood had passed. In its place came the old feeling of\r\ndesolation. He was a child, aching for sympathy. He wanted to tell his\r\ntroubles. Punctuating his narrative with many gestures and an\r\noccasional gulp, he proceeded to do so. The American listened\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n'So you can't sell your picture, and you've lost your job, and your\r\ngirl has shaken you?' he said. 'Pretty bad, but still you've no call to\r\ngo mingling with automobile wheels. You come along with me to my hotel,\r\nand tomorrow we'll see if we can't fix up something.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was breakfast at the hotel next morning, a breakfast to put heart\r\ninto a man. During the meal a messenger dispatched in a cab to Paul's\r\nlodgings returned with the canvas. A deferential waiter informed the\r\nAmerican that it had been taken with every possible care to his suite.\r\n\r\n'Good,' said the young man. 'If you're through, we'll go and have a\r\nlook at it.'\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs. There was the picture resting against a chair.\r\n\r\n'Why, I call that fine,' said the young man. 'It's a cracker jack.'\r\n\r\nPaul's heart gave a sudden leap. Could it be that here was the wealthy\r\nconnoisseur? He was wealthy, for he drove an automobile and lived in an\r\nexpensive hotel. He was a connoisseur, for he had said that the picture\r\nwas a crackerjack.\r\n\r\n'Monsieur is kind,' murmured Paul.\r\n\r\n'It's a bear-cat,' said the young man, admiringly.\r\n\r\n'Monsieur is flattering,' said Paul, dimly perceiving a compliment.\r\n\r\n'I've been looking for a picture like that,' said the young man, 'for\r\nmonths.'\r\n\r\nPaul's eyes rolled heavenwards.\r\n\r\n'If you'll make a few alterations, I'll buy it and ask for more.'\r\n\r\n'Alterations, monsieur?'\r\n\r\n'One or two small ones.' He pointed to the stooping figure of the\r\nshepherd. 'Now, you see this prominent citizen. What's he doing!'\r\n\r\n'He is stooping,' said Paul, fervently, 'to bestow upon his loved one a\r\nkiss. And she, sleeping, all unconscious, dreaming of him--'\r\n\r\n'Never mind about her. Fix your mind on him. Willie is the \"star\" in\r\nthis show. You have summed him up accurately. He is stooping. Stooping\r\ngood. Now, if that fellow was wearing braces and stooped like that,\r\nyou'd say he'd burst those braces, wouldn't you?'\r\n\r\nWith a somewhat dazed air Paul said that he thought he would. Till now\r\nhe had not looked at the figure from just that view-point.\r\n\r\n'You'd say he'd bust them?'\r\n\r\n'Assuredly, monsieur.'\r\n\r\n'No!' said the young man, solemnly, tapping him earnestly on the chest.\r\n'That's where you're wrong. Not if they were Galloway's Tried and\r\nProven. Galloway's Tried and Proven will stand any old strain you care\r\nto put on them. See small bills. Wear Galloway's Tried and Proven, and\r\nfate cannot touch you. You can take it from me. I'm the company's\r\ngeneral manager.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, monsieur!'\r\n\r\n'And I'll make a proposition to you. Cut out that mossy bank, and make\r\nthe girl lying in a hammock. Put Willie in shirt-sleeves instead of a\r\nbathrobe, and fix him up with a pair of the Tried and Proven, and I'll\r\ngive you three thousand dollars for that picture and a retaining fee of\r\nfour thousand a year to work for us and nobody else for any number of\r\nyears you care to mention. You've got the goods. You've got just the\r\ntouch. That happy look on Willie's face, for instance. You can see in a\r\nminute why he's so happy. It's because he's wearing the Tried and\r\nProven, and he knows that however far he stoops they won't break. Is\r\nthat a deal?'\r\n\r\nPaul's reply left no room for doubt. Seizing the young man firmly round\r\nthe waist, he kissed him with extreme fervour on both cheeks.\r\n\r\n'Here, break away!' cried the astonished general manager. 'That's no\r\nway to sign a business contract.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was at about five minutes after one that afternoon that Constable\r\nThomas Parsons, patrolling his beat, was aware of a man motioning to\r\nhim from the doorway of Bredin's Parisian Cafe and Restaurant. The man\r\nlooked like a pig. He grunted like a pig. He had the lavish\r\n_embonpoint_ of a pig. Constable Parsons suspected that he had a\r\nporcine soul. Indeed, the thought flitted across Constable Parsons'\r\nmind that, if he were to tie a bit of blue ribbon round his neck, he\r\ncould win prizes with him at a show.\r\n\r\n'What's all this?' he inquired, halting.\r\n\r\nThe stout man talked volubly in French. Constable Parsons shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n'Talk sense,' he advised.\r\n\r\n'In dere,' cried the stout man, pointing behind him into the\r\nrestaurant, 'a man, a--how you say?--yes, sacked. An employe whom I\r\nyesterday sacked, today he returns. I say to him, \"Cochon, va!\"'\r\n\r\n'What's that?'\r\n\r\n'I say, \"Peeg, go!\" How you say? Yes, \"pop off!\" I say, \"Peeg, pop\r\noff!\" But he--no, no; he sits and will not go. Come in, officer, and\r\nexpel him.'\r\n\r\nWith massive dignity the policeman entered the restaurant. At one of\r\nthe tables sat Paul, calm and distrait. From across the room Jeanne\r\nstared freezingly.\r\n\r\n'What's all this?' inquired Constable Parsons. Paul looked up.\r\n\r\n'I too,' he admitted, 'I cannot understand. Figure to yourself,\r\nmonsieur. I enter this cafe to lunch, and this man here would expel\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'He is an employe whom I--I myself--have but yesterday dismissed,'\r\nvociferated M. Bredin. 'He has no money to lunch at my restaurant.'\r\n\r\nThe policeman eyed Paul sternly.\r\n\r\n'Eh?' he said. 'That so? You'd better come along.'\r\n\r\nPaul's eyebrows rose.\r\n\r\nBefore the round eyes of M. Bredin he began to produce from his pockets\r\nand to lay upon the table bank-notes and sovereigns. The cloth was\r\ncovered with them.\r\n\r\nHe picked up a half-sovereign.\r\n\r\n'If monsieur,' he said to the policeman, 'would accept this as a slight\r\nconsolation for the inconvenience which this foolish person here has\r\ncaused him--'\r\n\r\n'Not half,' said Mr Parsons, affably. 'Look here'--he turned to the\r\ngaping proprietor--'if you go on like this you'll be getting yourself\r\ninto trouble. See? You take care another time.'\r\n\r\nPaul called for the bill of fare.\r\n\r\nIt was the inferior person who had succeeded to his place as waiter who\r\nattended to his needs during the meal; but when he had lunched it was\r\nJeanne who brought his coffee.\r\n\r\nShe bent over the table.\r\n\r\n'You sold your picture, Paul--yes?' she whispered. 'For much money? How\r\nglad I am, dear Paul. Now we will--'\r\n\r\nPaul met her glance coolly.\r\n\r\n'Will you be so kind,' he said, 'as to bring me also a cigarette, my\r\ngood girl?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO DISLIKED CATS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Harold who first made us acquainted, when I was dining one night\r\nat the Cafe Britannique, in Soho. It is a peculiarity of the Cafe\r\nBritannique that you will always find flies there, even in winter. Snow\r\nwas falling that night as I turned in at the door, but, glancing about\r\nme, I noticed several of the old faces. My old acquaintance, Percy the\r\nbluebottle, looking wonderfully fit despite his years, was doing deep\r\nbreathing exercises on a mutton cutlet, and was too busy to do more\r\nthan pause for a moment to nod at me; but his cousin, Harold, always\r\nactive, sighted me and bustled up to do the honours.\r\n\r\nHe had finished his game of touch-last with my right ear, and was\r\ncircling slowly in the air while he thought out other ways of\r\nentertaining me, when there was a rush of air, a swish of napkin, and\r\nno more Harold.\r\n\r\nI turned to thank my preserver, whose table adjoined mine. He was a\r\nFrenchman, a melancholy-looking man. He had the appearance of one who\r\nhas searched for the leak in life's gas-pipe with a lighted candle; of\r\none whom the clenched fist of Fate has smitten beneath the\r\ntemperamental third waistcoat-button.\r\n\r\nHe waved my thanks aside. 'It was a bagatelle,' he said. We became\r\nfriendly. He moved to my table, and we fraternized over our coffee.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he became agitated. He kicked at something on the floor. His\r\neyes gleamed angrily.\r\n\r\n'Ps-s-st!' he hissed. 'Va-t'en!'\r\n\r\nI looked round the corner of the table, and perceived the restaurant\r\ncat in dignified retreat.\r\n\r\n'You do not like cats?' I said.\r\n\r\n'I 'ate all animals, monsieur. Cats especially.' He frowned. He seemed\r\nto hesitate.\r\n\r\n'I will tell you my story,' he said. 'You will sympathize. You have a\r\nsympathetic face. It is the story of a man's tragedy. It is the story\r\nof a blighted life. It is the story of a woman who would not forgive.\r\nIt is the story--'\r\n\r\n'I've got an appointment at eleven,' I said.\r\n\r\nHe nodded absently, drew at his cigarette, and began:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have conceived my 'atred of animals, monsieur, many years ago in\r\nParis. Animals are to me a symbol for the lost dreams of youth, for\r\nambitions foiled, for artistic impulses cruelly stifled. You are\r\nastonished. You ask why I say these things. I shall tell you.\r\n\r\nI am in Paris, young, ardent, artistic. I wish to paint pictures. I\r\n'ave the genius, the ent'usiasm. I wish to be disciple of the great\r\nBouguereau. But no. I am dependent for support upon an uncle. He is\r\nrich. He is proprietor of the great Hotel Jules Priaulx. My name is\r\nalso Priaulx. He is not sympathetic. I say, 'Uncle, I 'ave the genius,\r\nthe ent'usiasm. Permit me to paint.' He shakes his head. He say, 'I\r\nwill give you position in my hotel, and you shall earn your living.'\r\nWhat choice? I weep, but I kill my dreams, and I become cashier at my\r\nuncle's hotel at a salary of thirty-five francs a week. I, the artist,\r\nbecome a machine for the changing of money at dam bad salary. What\r\nwould you? What choice? I am dependent. I go to the hotel, and there I\r\nlearn to 'ate all animals. Cats especially.\r\n\r\nI will tell you the reason. My uncle's hotel is fashionable hotel. Rich\r\nAmericans, rich Maharajahs, rich people of every nation come to my\r\nuncle's hotel. They come, and with them they have brought their pets.\r\nMonsieur, it was the existence of a nightmare. Wherever I have looked\r\nthere are animals. Listen. There is an Indian prince. He has with him\r\ntwo dromedaries. There is also one other Indian prince. With him is a\r\ngiraffe. The giraffe drink every day one dozen best champagne to keep\r\nhis coat good. I, the artist, have my bock, and my coat is not good.\r\nThere is a guest with a young lion. There is a guest with an alligator.\r\nBut especially there is a cat. He is fat. His name is Alexander. He\r\nbelongs to an American woman. She is fat. She exhibits him to me. He is\r\nwrapped in a silk and fur creation like an opera cloak. Every day she\r\nexhibits him. It is 'Alexander this' and 'Alexander that', till I 'ate\r\nAlexander very much. I 'ate all the animals, but especially Alexander.\r\n\r\nAnd so, monsieur, it goes on, day by day, in this hotel that is a\r\nZoological Garden. And every day I 'ate the animals the more. But\r\nespecially Alexander.\r\n\r\nWe artists, monsieur, we are martyrs to our nerves. It became\r\ninsupportable, this thing. Each day it became more insupportable. At\r\nnight I dream of all the animals, one by one--the giraffe, the two\r\ndromedaries, the young lion, the alligator, and Alexander. Especially\r\nAlexander. You have 'eard of men who cannot endure the society of a\r\ncat--how they cry out and jump in the air if a cat is among those\r\npresent. _Hein_? Your Lord Roberts? Precisely, monsieur. I have\r\nread so much. Listen, then. I am become by degrees almost like 'im. I\r\ndo not cry out and jump in the air when I see the cat Alexander, but I\r\ngrind my teeth and I 'ate 'im.\r\n\r\nYes, I am the sleeping volcano, and one morning, monsieur, I have\r\nsuffered the eruption. It is like this. I shall tell you.\r\n\r\nNot only at that time am I the martyr to nerves, but also to toothache.\r\nThat morning I 'ave 'ad the toothache very bad. I 'ave been in pain the\r\nmost terrible. I groan as I add up the figures in my book.\r\n\r\nAs I groan I 'ear a voice.\r\n\r\n'Say good morning to M. Priaulx, Alexander.' Conceive my emotions,\r\nmonsieur, when this fat, beastly cat is placed before me upon my desk!\r\n\r\nIt put the cover upon it. No, that is not the phrase. The lid. It put\r\nthe lid upon it. All my smothered 'atred of the animal burst forth. I\r\ncould no longer conceal my 'atred.\r\n\r\nI rose. I was terrible. I seized 'im by the tail. I flung him--I did\r\nnot know where. I did not care. Not then. Afterwards, yes, but not\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nYour Longfellow has a poem. 'I shot an arrow into the air. It fell to\r\nearth, I know not where.' And then he has found it. The arrow in the\r\n'eart of a friend. Am I right? Also was that the tragedy with me. I\r\nflung the cat Alexander. My uncle, on whom I am dependent, is passing\r\nat the moment. He has received the cat in the middle of his face.\r\n\r\nMy companion, with the artist's instinct for the 'curtain', paused. He\r\nlooked round the brightly-lit restaurant. From every side arose the\r\nclatter of knife and fork, and the clear, sharp note of those who drank\r\nsoup. In a distant corner a small waiter with a large voice was calling\r\nthe cook names through the speaking-tube. It was a cheerful scene, but\r\nit brought no cheer to my companion. He sighed heavily and resumed:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI 'urry over that painful scene. There is blooming row. My uncle is\r\n'ot-tempered man. The cat is 'eavy cat. I 'ave thrown 'im very hard,\r\nfor my nerves and my toothache and my 'atred 'ave given me the giant's\r\nstrength. Alone is this enough to enrage my 'ot-tempered uncle. I am\r\nthere in his hotel, you will understand, as cashier, not as\r\ncat-thrower. And now, besides all this, I have insulted valuable\r\npatron. She 'ave left the hotel that day.\r\n\r\nThere are no doubts in my mind as to the outcome. With certainty I\r\nawait my _conge_. And after painful scene I get it. I am to go. At\r\nonce. He 'ave assured the angry American woman that I go at once.\r\n\r\nHe has called me into his private office. 'Jean,' he has said to me, at\r\nthe end of other things, 'you are a fool, dolt, no-good imbecile. I\r\ngive you good place in my hotel, and you spend your time flinging cats.\r\nI will 'ave no more of you. But even now I cannot forget that you are\r\nmy dear brother's child. I will now give you one thousand francs and\r\nnever see you again.'\r\n\r\nI have thanked him, for to me it is wealth. Not before have I ever had\r\none thousand francs of my own.\r\n\r\nI go out of the hotel. I go to a _cafe_ and order a bock. I smoke\r\na cigarette. It is necessary that I think out plans. Shall I with my\r\none thousand francs rent a studio in the Quarter and commence my life\r\nas artist? No. I have still the genius, the ent'usiasm, but I have not\r\nthe training. To train myself to paint pictures I must study long, and\r\neven one thousand francs will not last for ever. Then what shall I do?\r\nI do not know. I order one other bock, and smoke more cigarettes, but\r\nstill I do not know.\r\n\r\nAnd then I say to myself, 'I will go back to my uncle, and plead with\r\nhim. I will seize favourable opportunity. I will approach him after\r\ndinner when he is in good temper. But for that I must be close at hand.\r\nI must be--what's your expression?--\"Johnny-on-the-spot\".'\r\n\r\nMy mind is made up. I have my plan.\r\n\r\nI have gone back to my uncle's hotel, and I have engaged not too\r\nexpensive bedroom. My uncle does not know. He still is in his private\r\noffice. I secure my room.\r\n\r\nI dine cheaply that night, but I go to theatre and also to supper after\r\nthe theatre, for have I not my thousand francs? It is late when I reach\r\nmy bedroom.\r\n\r\nI go to bed. I go to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut I do not sleep long. I am awakened by a voice.\r\n\r\nIt is a voice that says, 'Move and I shoot! Move and I shoot!' I lie\r\nstill. I do not move. I am courageous, but I am unarmed.\r\n\r\nAnd the voice says again, 'Move and I shoot!' Is it robbers? Is it some\r\nmarauder who has made his way to my room to plunder me?\r\n\r\nI do not know. Per'aps I think yes.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' I have asked.\r\n\r\nThere is no answer.\r\n\r\nI take my courage in my 'ands. I leap from my bed. I dash for the door.\r\nNo pistol has been fire. I have reached the passage, and have shouted\r\nfor assistance.\r\n\r\nHotel officials run up. Doors open. 'What is it?' voices cry.\r\n\r\n'There is in my room an armed robber,' I assure them.\r\n\r\nAnd then I have found--no, I am mistaken. My door, you will understand,\r\nis open. And as I have said these words, a large green parrot comes\r\n'opping out. My assassin is nothing but a green parrot.\r\n\r\n'Move and I shoot!' it has said to those gathered in the corridor. It\r\nthen has bitten me in the 'and and passed on.\r\n\r\nI am chagrined, monsieur. But only for a moment. Then I forget my\r\nchagrin. For a voice from a door that 'as opened says with joy, 'It is\r\nmy Polly, which I 'ave this evening lost!'\r\n\r\nI turn. I gasp for admiration. It is a beautiful lady in a pink\r\ndressing-gown which 'ave spoken these words.\r\n\r\nShe has looked at me. I 'ave looked at her. I forget everything but\r\nthat she is adorable. I forget those who stand by. I forget that the\r\nparrot has bitten me in the 'and. I forget even that I am standing\r\nthere in pyjamas, with on my feet nothing. I can only gaze at her and\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nI have found words.\r\n\r\n'Mademoiselle,' I have said, 'I am rejoiced that I have been the means\r\nof restoring to you your bird.'\r\n\r\nShe has thanked me with her eyes, and then with words also. I am\r\nbewitched. She is divine. I care not that my feet are cold. I could\r\nwish to stand there talking all night.\r\n\r\nShe has given a cry of dismay.\r\n\r\n'Your 'and! It is wounded!'\r\n\r\nI look at my 'and. Yes, it is bleeding, where the bird 'ave bitten it.\r\n\r\n'Tchut, mademoiselle,' I have said. 'It is a bagatelle.'\r\n\r\nBut no. She is distressed. She is what your poet Scott 'ave said, a\r\nministering angel thou. She 'ave torn her 'andkerchief and is binding\r\nup my wound. I am enchanted. Such beauty! Such kindness! 'Ardly can I\r\nresist to fall on my knees before 'er and declare my passion.\r\n\r\nWe are twin souls. She has thanked me again. She has scolded the\r\nparrot. She has smiled upon me as she retires to her room. It is\r\nenough. Nothing is said, but I am a man of sensibility and discernment,\r\nand I understand that she will not be offended if I seek to renew our\r\nfriendship on a more suitable occasion.\r\n\r\nThe doors shut. The guests have returned to bed, the hotel servants to\r\ntheir duties. And I go back to my room. But not to sleep. It is very\r\nlate, but I do not sleep. I lie awake and think of 'er.\r\n\r\nYou will conceive, Monsieur, with what mixed feelings I descend next\r\nmorning. On the one 'and, I must keep the sharp look-out for my uncle,\r\nfor 'im I must avoid till he shall have--what do you say in your\r\nidiom? Yes, I have it--simmered down and tucked in his shirt. On the\r\nother 'and, I must watch for my lady of the parrot. I count the minutes\r\ntill we shall meet again.\r\n\r\nI avoid my uncle with success, and I see 'er about the hour of\r\n_dejeuner_. She is talking to old gentleman. I have bowed. She\r\nhave smiled and motioned me to approach.\r\n\r\n'Father,' she has said, 'this is the gentleman who caught Polly.'\r\n\r\nWe have shaken hands. He is indulgent papa. He has smiled and thanked\r\nme also. We have confided to each other our names. He is English. He\r\nowns much land in England. He has been staying in Paris. He is rich.\r\nHis name is 'Enderson. He addresses his daughter, and call her Marion.\r\nIn my 'eart I also call her Marion. You will perceive that I am, as you\r\nsay, pretty far gone.\r\n\r\nThe hour of _dejeuner_ has arrived. I entreat them to be my\r\nguests. I can run to it, you understand, for there are still in my\r\npockets plenty of my uncle's francs. They consent. I am in 'eaven.\r\n\r\nAll is well. Our friendship has progressed with marvellous speed. The\r\nold gentleman and I are swiftly the dear old pals. I 'ave confided to\r\n'im my dreams of artistic fame, and he has told me 'ow much he dislikes\r\nyour Lloyd George. He has mentioned that he and Miss Marion depart for\r\nLondon that day. I am desolate. My face tumbles. He has observed my\r\ndespair. He has invited me to visit them in London.\r\n\r\nImagine my chagrin. To visit them in London is the one thing I desire\r\nto do. But how? I accept gratefully, but I ask myself how it is to be\r\ndone? I am poor blighter with no profession and nine 'undred francs. He\r\n'as taken it for granted that I am wealthy.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I do? I spend the afternoon trying to form a plan. And then\r\nI am resolved. I will go to my uncle and say: 'Uncle, I have the\r\nmagnificent chance to marry the daughter of wealthy English landowner.\r\nAlready I 'ave her gratitude. Soon--for I am young, 'andsome,\r\ndebonair--I shall 'ave her love. Give me one more chance, uncle. Be\r\ndecent old buck, and put up the money for this affair.'\r\n\r\nThese words I have resolved to say to my uncle.\r\n\r\nI go back to the hotel. I enter his private office. I reveal no secret\r\nwhen I say that he is not cordial.\r\n\r\n'Ten thousand devils!' he has cried. 'What do you here?'\r\n\r\nI 'asten to tell him all, and plead with him to be decent old buck. He\r\ndoes not believe.\r\n\r\nWho is he? he asks. This English landowner? How did I meet him? And\r\nwhere?\r\n\r\nI tell him. He is amazed.\r\n\r\n'You 'ad the infernal impudence to take room in my hotel?' he has\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nI am crafty. I am diplomat.\r\n\r\n'Where else, dear uncle?' I say. 'In all Paris there is no such 'ome\r\nfrom 'ome. The cuisine--marvellous! The beds--of rose-leaves! The\r\nattendance--superb! If only for one night, I have said to myself, I\r\nmust stay in this of all hotels.'\r\n\r\nI 'ave--what do you say?--touched the spot.\r\n\r\n'In what you say,' he has said, more calmly, 'there is certainly\r\nsomething. It is a good hotel, this of mine!'\r\n\r\nThe only hotel, I have assured him. The Meurice? _Chut!_ I snap my\r\nfingers. The Ritz? Bah! Once again I snap my fingers. 'In all Paris\r\nthere is no hotel like this.'\r\n\r\nHe 'as simmered down. His shirt is tucked in. 'Tell me again this plan\r\nof yours, Jean.'\r\n\r\nWhen I leave 'im we have come to an understanding. It is agreed between\r\nus that I am to 'ave one last chance. He will not spoil this promising\r\nship for the 'a'porth of tar. He will give me money for my purpose. But\r\nhe has said, as we part, if I fail, his 'ands shall be washed of me. He\r\ncannot now forget that I am his dear brother's child; but if I fail to\r\naccomplish the conquest of the divine Miss Marion, he thinks he will be\r\nable to.\r\n\r\nIt is well. A week later I follow the 'Endersons to London.\r\n\r\nFor the next few days, monsieur, I am in Paradise. My 'ost has much\r\nnice 'ouse in Eaton Square. He is rich, popular. There is much society.\r\nAnd I--I have the _succes fou_. I am young, 'andsome, debonair. I\r\ncannot speak the English very well--not so well as I now speak 'im--but\r\nI manage. I get along. I am intelligent, amiable. Everyone loves me.\r\n\r\nNo, not everyone. Captain Bassett, he does not love me. And why?\r\nBecause he loves the charming Miss Marion, and observes that already I\r\nam succeeding with her like a 'ouse on fire. He is _ami de\r\nfamille_. He is captain in your Garde Ecossais, and my 'ost told me\r\n'e has distinguished himself as soldier pretty much. It may be so. As\r\nsoldier, per'aps. But at conversation he is not so good. He is quite\r\nnice fellow, you understand--'andsome, yes; distinguished, yes. But he\r\ndoes not sparkle. He has not my _verve_, my _elan_. I--how do\r\nyou say?--I make the rings round him.\r\n\r\nBut, _Chut_! At that moment I would have made the rings round the\r\n'ole British Army. Yes, and also the Corps Diplomatique. For I am\r\ninspired. Love 'as inspired me. I am conqueror.\r\n\r\nBut I will not weary you, monsieur, with the details of my wooing. You\r\nare sympathetic, but I must not weary you. Let us say that I 'ave in\r\nfour days or five made progress the most remarkable, and proceed to the\r\ntragic end.\r\n\r\nAlmost could I tell it in four words. In them one would say that it is\r\nset forth. There was in London at that time popular a song, a comic,\r\nvulgar song of the 'Alls, 'The Cat Came Back'. You 'ave 'eard it? Yes?\r\nI 'eard it myself, and without emotion. It had no sinister warning for\r\nme. It did not strike me as omen. Yet, in those four words, monsieur,\r\nis my tragedy.\r\n\r\nHow? I shall tell you. Every word is a sword twisted in my 'eart, but I\r\nshall tell you.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon we are at tea. All is well. I am vivacious, gay; Miss\r\nMarion, charming, gracious. There is present also an aunt, Mr\r\n'Enderson's sister; but 'er I do not much notice. It is to Marion I\r\nspeak--both with my lips and also with my eyes.\r\n\r\nAs we sit, Captain Bassett is announced.\r\n\r\nHe has entered. We have greeted each other politely but coldly, for we\r\nare rivals. There is in his manner also a something which I do not much\r\nlike--a species of suppressed triumph, of elation.\r\n\r\nI am uneasy--but only yet vaguely, you will understand. I have not the\r\nforeboding that he is about to speak my death-sentence.\r\n\r\nHe addresses Miss Marion. There is joy in his voice. 'Miss 'Enderson,'\r\nhe has said, 'I have for you the bally good news. You will remember,\r\nisn't it, the cat belonging to the American woman in the hotel at\r\nParis, of which you have spoken to me? Last night at dinner I have been\r\nseated beside her. At first I am not certain is it she. Then I say that\r\nthere cannot be two Mrs Balderstone Rockmettlers in Europe, so I\r\nmention to her the cat. And, to cut the long story short, I have\r\nventured to purchase for you as a little present the cat Alexander.'\r\n\r\nI have uttered a cry of horror, but it is not 'eard because of Miss\r\nMarion's cry of joy.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Captain Bassett,' she has said, 'how very splendid of you! Ever\r\nsince I first saw him have I loved Alexander. I cannot tell you how\r\ngrateful I am. But it amazes me that you should have been able to\r\ninduce her to part with 'im. In Paris she has refused all my offers.'\r\n\r\nHe has paused, embarrassed.\r\n\r\n'The fact is,' he has said, 'there is between her and Alexander a\r\ncertain coolness. He 'as deceived 'er, and she loves him no more.\r\nImmediately upon arrival in London, he had the misfortune to 'ave six\r\nfine kittens. 'Owever, out of evil cometh good, and I have thus been\r\nable to secure 'im for you. 'E is downstairs in a basket!'\r\n\r\nMiss Marion 'as rung the bell and commanded for him to be brought\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nI will not describe the meeting, monsieur. You are sympathetic. You\r\nwill understand my feelings. Let us 'urry on.\r\n\r\nFigure yourself, monsieur, to what extent I was now 'arassed. I am\r\nartist. I am a man of nerves. I cannot be gay, brilliant, debonair in\r\nthe presence of a cat. Yet always the cat is there. It is terrible.\r\n\r\nI feel that I am falling behind in the race. 'Er gratitude has made her\r\nthe more gracious to Captain Bassett. She smiles upon him. And, like\r\nChanticleer at the sight of the sun, he flaps his wings and crows. He\r\nis no longer the silent listener. It is I who have become the silent\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\nI have said to myself that something must be done.\r\n\r\nChance has shown me the way. One afternoon I am by fortune alone in the\r\n'all. In his cage the parrot Polly is 'opping. I address him through\r\nthe bars.\r\n\r\n'Move and I shoot I' he has cried.\r\n\r\nThe tears have filled my eyes. 'Ow it has brought the 'ole scene back\r\nto me!\r\n\r\nAs I weep, I perceive the cat Alexander approaching.\r\n\r\nI have formed a plan. I have opened the cage-door and released the\r\nparrot. The cat, I think, will attack the parrot of which Miss\r\n'Enderson is so fond. She will love him no more. He will be expelled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe paused. I suppose my face must have lost some of its alleged\r\nsympathy as he set forth this fiendish plot. Even Percy the bluebottle\r\nseemed shocked. He had settled on the sugar-bowl, but at these words he\r\nrose in a marked manner and left the table.\r\n\r\n'You do not approve?' he said.\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders.\r\n\r\n'It's no business of mine,' I said. 'But don't you think yourself it\r\nwas playing it a bit low down? Didn't the thought present itself to you\r\nin a shadowy way that it was rather rough on the bird?'\r\n\r\n'It did, monsieur. But what would you? It is necessary to break eggs in\r\norder to make an omelette. All is fair, you say, in love and war, and\r\nthis was both. Moreover, you must understand, I do not dictate his\r\nmovements to the parrot. He is free agent. I do but open the cage-door.\r\nShould he 'op out and proceed to the floor where is the cat, that is\r\nhis affair. I shall continue, yes?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Alors!_ I open the cage-door and disappear discreetly. It is not\r\npolitic that I remain to witness what shall transpire. It is for me to\r\nestablish an alibi. I go to the drawing-room, where I remain.\r\n\r\nAt dinner that night Mr 'Enderson has laughed.\r\n\r\n'In the 'all this afternoon,' he has said, 'I have seen by chance the\r\ndickens of a funny occurrence. That parrot of yours, Marion, had\r\nescaped once again from its cage and was 'aving an argument with that\r\ncat which Captain Bassett has given to you.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! I hope that Alexander 'as not hurt poor Polly, of whom I am very\r\nfond,' she has said.\r\n\r\n'The affair did not come to blows,' has said Mr 'Enderson. 'You may\r\ntrust that bird to take care of himself, my dear. When I came upon the\r\nscene the cat was crouching in a corner, with his fur bristling and his\r\nback up, while Polly, standing before 'im, was telling 'im not to move\r\nor he would shoot. Nor did he move, till I 'ad seized the parrot and\r\nreplaced him in the cage, when he shot upstairs like a streak of\r\nlightning. By sheer force of character that excellent bird 'ad won the\r\nbloodless victory. I drink to 'im!'\r\n\r\nYou can conceive my emotion as I listen to this tale. I am like the\r\npoet's mice and men whose best-kid schemes have gone away. I am\r\nbaffled. I am discouraged. I do not know what I shall do. I must find\r\nanother plan, but I do not know what.\r\n\r\nHow shall I remove the cat? Shall I kill 'im? No, for I might be\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\nShall I 'ire someone to steal 'im? No, for my accomplice might betray\r\nme.\r\n\r\nShall I myself steal 'im? Ah! that is better. That is a very good plan.\r\n\r\nSoon I have it perfected, this plan. Listen, monsieur; it is as\r\nfollows. It is simple, but it is good. I will await my opportunity. I\r\nwill remove the cat secretly from the 'ouse. I will take him to an\r\noffice of the District Messenger Boys. I will order a messenger to\r\ncarry him at once to the Cats' House, and to request M. le Directeur\r\nimmediately to destroy him. It is a simple plan, but it is good.\r\n\r\nI carry it through without a 'itch. It is not so difficult to secure\r\nthe cat. 'E is asleep in the drawing-room. There is nobody at hand. I\r\nhave in my bedroom a 'at-box which I have brought from Paris. I have\r\nbrought it with me to the drawing-room. I have placed in it the cat. I\r\nhave escaped from the 'ouse. The cat has uttered a cry, but none has\r\n'eard. I have reached the office of the District Messenger Boys. I have\r\n'anded over the cat in its box. The manager is courteous, sympathetic.\r\nA messenger has started in a cab for the Cats' House. I have breathed\r\na sigh of relief. I am saved.\r\n\r\nThat is what I say to myself as I return. My troubles are over, and\r\nonce more I can be gay, debonair, vivacious with Miss Marion, for no\r\nlonger will there be present the cat Alexander to 'arass me.\r\n\r\nWhen I have returned there is commotion in the 'ouse. I pass on the\r\nstairs domestics calling 'Puss, puss!' The butler is chirruping loudly\r\nand poking beneath the furniture with a umbrella. All is confusion and\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room is Miss Marion. She is distressed.\r\n\r\n'Nowhere,' she has said, 'can there be found the cat Alexander of whom\r\nI am so fond. Nowhere in the 'ouse is he, Where can he be? He is lost.'\r\n\r\nI am gentle, sympathetic. I endeavour to console her. I 'int to her\r\nthat am I not sufficient substitute for a beastly cat? She is, however,\r\ninconsolable. I must be patient. I must wait my time.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bassett is announced. He is informed of what has 'appened. He\r\nis distressed. He has the air as if he, too, would endeavour to be\r\ngentle, sympathetic. But I am Johnny-on-the-spot. I stay till he 'as\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nNext day again it is 'Puss, puss!' Again the butler has explored under\r\nthe furniture with the umbrella. Again Miss Marion is distressed. Again\r\n'ave I endeavoured to console.\r\n\r\nThis time I think I am not so unsuccessful. I am, you understand,\r\nyoung, 'andsome, sympathetic. In another two ticks I am about to seize\r\n'er 'and and declare my passion.\r\n\r\nBut, before I can do so, Captain Bassett is announced.\r\n\r\nI gaze at him as at unsuccessful rival. I am confident. I am conqueror.\r\nAh, I little know! It is in the moments of our highest 'ope, monsieur,\r\nthat we are destroyed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bassett, he, too, 'as the air of the conqueror.\r\n\r\nHe has begun to speak.\r\n\r\n'Miss 'Enderson,' he has said, 'I have once more the bally good news. I\r\nrather fancy that I 'ave tracked down the missing Alexander, do you not\r\nknow?'\r\n\r\nMiss Marion 'as cried out with joy. But I am calm, for is not Alexander\r\nalready yesterday destroyed?\r\n\r\n'It is like this,' he has resumed. 'I have thought to myself where is\r\nlost cat most likely to be? And I have answered, \"In the Cats' House.\"\r\nI go this morning to the Cats' House, and there I see a cat which is\r\neither lost Alexander or his living image. Exactly is he the same to\r\nall appearances as the lost Alexander. But there is, when I try to\r\npurchase 'im, some curious 'itch which they do not explain. They must\r\n'ave time, they say, to consider. They cannot at once decide.'\r\n\r\n'Why, what nonsense!' Miss Marion 'ave cried. 'If the cat is my cat,\r\nsurely then must they return 'im to me! Come,' she has said, 'let us\r\nall three at once in a taxi-cab go to the Cats' House. If the all three\r\nof us identify the lost Alexander, then must they return 'im.'\r\n\r\nMonsieur, I am uneasy. I have foreboding. But I go. What choice? We go\r\nin a taxi-cab to the Cats' House.\r\n\r\nThe _directeur_ is courteous and sympathetic. He has introduced us\r\nto the cat, and my 'eart 'as turned to water, for it is Alexander. Why\r\nhas he not been destroyed?\r\n\r\nThe _directeur_ is speaking. I 'ear him in a dream.\r\n\r\n'If you identify 'im as your cat, miss,' he has said, 'the matter is\r\nended. My 'esitation when you, sir, approached me this morning on the\r\nmatter was due to the fact that a messenger was sent with instructions\r\nthat he be destroyed at once.'\r\n\r\n'Rather rough, wasn't it, that, on the messenger, yes,' Captain Bassett\r\nhas said. He is facetious, you understand, for he is conqueror.\r\n\r\nI am silent. I am not facetious. For already I feel--how do you\r\nsay?--my fowl is cooked.\r\n\r\n'Not the messenger, sir,' the _directeur_ has said. 'You 'ave\r\nmisunderstood me. It was the cat which was to be destroyed as per\r\ninstructions of the anonymous sender.'\r\n\r\n'Who could have played such a wicked trick?' Miss Marion has asked,\r\nindignant.\r\n\r\nThe _directeur_ has stooped, and from behind a table he has\r\nbrought a 'at-box.\r\n\r\n'In this,' he has said, 'the above animal was conveyed. But with it was\r\nno accompanying letter. The sender was anonymous.'\r\n\r\n'Per'aps,' Captain Bassett has said--and still more in a dream I 'ear\r\nhim--'per'aps on the 'at-box there is some bally name or other, do you\r\nnot know--what?'\r\n\r\nI clutch at the table. The room is spinning round and round. I have no\r\nstomach--only emptiness.\r\n\r\n'Why, bless me,' the _directeur_ has said, 'you're quite right,\r\nsir. So there is. Funny of me not to have before observed it. There is\r\na name, and also an address. It is the name of Jean Priaulx, and the\r\naddress is the Hotel Jules Priaulx, Paris.'\r\n\r\nMy companion stopped abruptly. He passed a handkerchief over his\r\nforehead. With a quick movement he reached for his glass of liqueur\r\nbrandy and drained it at a gulp.\r\n\r\n'Monsieur,' he said, 'you will not wish me to describe the scene? There\r\nis no need for me--_hein?_--to be Zolaesque. You can imagine?'\r\n\r\n'She chucked you?' In moments of emotion it is the simplest language\r\nthat comes to the lips.\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n'And married Captain Bassett?'\r\n\r\nHe nodded again.\r\n\r\n'And your uncle?' I said. 'How did he take it?'\r\n\r\nHe sighed.\r\n\r\n'There was once more,' he said, 'blooming row, monsieur.'\r\n\r\n'He washed his hands of you?'\r\n\r\n'Not altogether. He was angry, but he gave me one more chance. I am\r\nstill 'is dear brother's child, and he cannot forget it. An\r\nacquaintance of his, a man of letters, a M. Paul Sartines, was in need\r\nof a secretary. The post was not well paid, but it was permanent. My\r\nuncle insist that I take it. What choice? I took it. It is the post\r\nwhich I still 'old.'\r\n\r\nHe ordered another liqueur brandy and gulped it down.\r\n\r\n'The name is familiar to you, monsieur? You 'ave 'eard of M. Sartines?'\r\n\r\n'I don't think I have. Who is he?'\r\n\r\n'He is a man of letters, a _savant_. For five years he has been\r\noccupied upon a great work. It is with that that I assist him by\r\ncollecting facts for 'is use. I 'ave spent this afternoon in the\r\nBritish Museum collecting facts. Tomorrow I go again. And the next day.\r\nAnd again after that. The book will occupy yet another ten years before\r\nit is completed. It is his great work.'\r\n\r\n'It sounds as if it was,' I said. 'What's it about?'\r\n\r\nHe signalled to the waiter.\r\n\r\n'_Garcon_, one other liqueur brandy. The book, monsieur, is a\r\n'_Istory of the Cat in Ancient Egypt._'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUTH IN EXILE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clock struck five--briskly, as if time were money. Ruth Warden got\r\nup from her desk and, having put on her hat, emerged into the outer\r\noffice where M. Gandinot received visitors. M. Gandinot, the ugliest\r\nman in Roville-sur-Mer, presided over the local _mont-de-piete_,\r\nand Ruth served him, from ten to five, as a sort of secretary-clerk.\r\nHer duties, if monotonous, were simple. They consisted of sitting,\r\ndetached and invisible, behind a ground-glass screen, and entering\r\ndetails of loans in a fat book. She was kept busy as a rule, for\r\nRoville possesses two casinos, each offering the attraction of\r\n_petits chevaux_, and just round the corner is Monte Carlo. Very\r\nbrisk was the business done by M. Gandinot, the pawnbroker, and very\r\nfrequent were the pitying shakes of the head and clicks of the tongue\r\nof M. Gandinot, the man; for in his unofficial capacity Ruth's employer\r\nhad a gentle soul, and winced at the evidences of tragedy which\r\npresented themselves before his official eyes.\r\n\r\nHe blinked up at Ruth as she appeared, and Ruth, as she looked at him,\r\nwas conscious, as usual, of a lightening of the depression which,\r\nnowadays, seemed to have settled permanently upon her. The peculiar\r\nquality of M. Gandinot's extraordinary countenance was that it induced\r\nmirth--not mocking laughter, but a kind of smiling happiness. It\r\npossessed that indefinable quality which characterizes the Billiken,\r\ndue, perhaps, to the unquenchable optimism which shone through the\r\nirregular features; for M. Gandinot, despite his calling, believed in\r\nhis fellow-man.\r\n\r\n'You are going, mademoiselle?'\r\n\r\nAs Ruth was wearing her hat and making for the door, and as she always\r\nleft at this hour, a purist might have considered the question\r\nsuperfluous; but M. Gandinot was a man who seized every opportunity of\r\npractising his English.\r\n\r\n'You will not wait for the good papa who calls so regularly for you?'\r\n\r\n'I think I won't today, M. Gandinot. I want to get out into the air. I\r\nhave rather a headache. Will you tell my father I have gone to the\r\nPromenade?'\r\n\r\nM. Gandinot sighed as the door closed behind her. Ruth's depression had\r\nnot escaped his notice. He was sorry for her. And not without cause,\r\nfor Fate had not dealt too kindly with Ruth.\r\n\r\nIt would have amazed Mr Eugene Warden, that genial old gentleman, if,\r\non one of those occasions of manly emotion when he was in the habit of\r\nobserving that he had been nobody's enemy but his own, somebody had\r\nhinted that he had spoiled his daughter's life. Such a thought had\r\nnever entered his head. He was one of those delightful, irresponsible,\r\nerratic persons whose heads thoughts of this kind do not enter, and who\r\nare about as deadly to those whose lives are bound up with theirs as a\r\nUpas tree.\r\n\r\nIn the memory of his oldest acquaintance, Ruth's father had never done\r\nanything but drift amiably through life. There had been a time when he\r\nhad done his drifting in London, feeding cheerfully from the hand of a\r\nlong-suffering brother-in-law. But though blood, as he was wont to\r\nremark while negotiating his periodical loans, is thicker than water, a\r\nbrother-in-law's affection has its limits. A day came when Mr Warden\r\nobserved with pain that his relative responded less nimbly to the\r\ntouch. And a little while later the other delivered his ultimatum. Mr\r\nWarden was to leave England, and to stay away from England, to behave\r\nas if England no longer existed on the map, and a small but sufficient\r\nallowance would be made to him. If he declined to do this, not another\r\npenny of the speaker's money would he receive. He could choose.\r\n\r\nHe chose. He left England, Ruth with him. They settled in Roville, that\r\nhaven of the exile who lives upon remittances.\r\n\r\nRuth's connexion with the _mont-de-piete_ had come about almost\r\nautomatically. Very soon after their arrival it became evident that, to\r\na man of Mr Warden's nature, resident a stone's-throw distant from two\r\ncasinos, the small allowance was not likely to go very far. Even if\r\nRuth had not wished to work, circumstances could have compelled her. As\r\nit was, she longed for something to occupy her, and, the vacancy at the\r\n_mont-de-piete_ occurring, she had snatched at it. There was a\r\ncertain fitness in her working there. Business transactions with that\r\nuseful institution had always been conducted by her, it being Mr\r\nWarden's theory that Woman can extract in these crises just that extra\r\nfranc or two which is denied to the mere male. Through constantly going\r\nround, running across, stepping over, and popping down to the\r\n_mont-de-piete_ she had established almost a legal claim on any post\r\nthat might be vacant there.\r\n\r\nAnd under M. Gandinot's banner she had served ever since.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive minutes' walk took her to the Promenade des Anglais, that\r\napparently endless thoroughfare which is Roville's pride. The evening\r\nwas fine and warm. The sun shone gaily on the white-walled houses, the\r\nbright Gardens, and the two gleaming casinos. But Ruth walked\r\nlistlessly, blind to the glitter of it all.\r\n\r\nVisitors who go to Roville for a few weeks in the winter are apt to\r\nspeak of the place, on their return, in a manner that conveys the\r\nimpression that it is a Paradise on earth, with gambling facilities\r\nthrown in. But, then, they are visitors. Their sojourn comes to an end.\r\nRuth's did not.\r\n\r\nA voice spoke her name. She turned, and saw her father, dapper as ever,\r\nstanding beside her.\r\n\r\n'What an evening, my dear!' said Mr Warden. 'What an evening! Smell the\r\nsea!'\r\n\r\nMr Warden appeared to be in high spirits. He hummed a tune and twirled\r\nhis cane. He chirruped frequently to Bill, the companion of his walks\r\nabroad, a wiry fox-terrier of a demeanour, like his master's, both\r\njaunty and slightly disreputable. An air of gaiety pervaded his\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\n'I called in at the _mont-de-piete_ but you had gone. Gandinot\r\ntold me you had come here. What an ugly fellow that Gandinot is! But a\r\ngood sort. I like him. I had a chat with him.'\r\n\r\nThe high spirits were explained. Ruth knew her father. She guessed,\r\ncorrectly, that M. Gandinot, kindest of pawnbrokers, had obliged, in\r\nhis unofficial capacity, with a trifling loan.\r\n\r\n'Gandinot ought to go on the stage,' went on Mr Warden, pursuing his\r\ntheme. 'With that face he would make his fortune. You can't help\r\nlaughing when you see it. One of these days--'\r\n\r\nHe broke off. Stirring things had begun to occur in the neighbourhood\r\nof his ankles, where Bill, the fox-terrier, had encountered an\r\nacquaintance, and, to the accompaniment of a loud, gargling noise, was\r\nendeavouring to bite his head off. The acquaintance, a gentleman of\r\nuncertain breed, equally willing, was chewing Bill's paw with the gusto\r\nof a gourmet. An Irish terrier, with no personal bias towards either\r\nside, was dancing round and attacking each in turn as he came\r\nuppermost. And two poodles leaped madly in and out of the melee,\r\nbarking encouragement.\r\n\r\nIt takes a better man than Mr Warden to break up a gathering of this\r\nkind. The old gentleman was bewildered. He added his voice to the\r\nbabel, and twice smote Bill grievously with his cane with blows\r\nintended for the acquaintance, but beyond that he effected nothing. It\r\nseemed probable that the engagement would last till the combatants had\r\nconsumed each other, after the fashion of the Kilkenny cats, when there\r\nsuddenly appeared from nowhere a young man in grey.\r\n\r\nThe world is divided into those who can stop dog-fights and those who\r\ncannot. The young man in grey belonged to the former class. Within a\r\nminute from his entrance on the scene the poodles and the Irish terrier\r\nhad vanished; the dog of doubtful breed was moving off up the hill,\r\nyelping, with the dispatch of one who remembers an important\r\nappointment, and Bill, miraculously calmed, was seated in the centre of\r\nthe Promenade, licking honourable wounds.\r\n\r\nMr Warden was disposed to effervesce with gratitude. The scene had\r\nshaken him, and there had been moments when he had given his ankles up\r\nfor lost.\r\n\r\n'Don't mention it,' said the young man. 'I enjoy arbitrating in these\r\nlittle disputes. Dogs seem to like me and trust my judgement. I\r\nconsider myself as a sort of honorary dog.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I am bound to say, Mr--?'\r\n\r\n'Vince--George Vince.'\r\n\r\n'My name is Warden. My daughter.'\r\n\r\nRuth inclined her head, and was conscious of a pair of very penetrating\r\nbrown eyes looking eagerly into hers in a manner which she thoroughly\r\nresented. She was not used to the other sex meeting her gaze and\r\nholding it as if confident of a friendly welcome. She made up her mind\r\nin that instant that this was a young man who required suppression.\r\n\r\n'I've seen you several times out here since I arrived, Miss Warden,'\r\nsaid Mr Vince. 'Four in all,' he added, precisely.\r\n\r\n'Really?' said Ruth.\r\n\r\nShe looked away. Her attitude seemed to suggest that she had finished\r\nwith him, and would be obliged if somebody would come and sweep him up.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the casino restlessness crept into Mr Warden's\r\nmanner. At the door he stopped and looked at Ruth.\r\n\r\n'I think, my dear--' he said.\r\n\r\n'Going to have a dash at the _petits chevaux?_' inquired Mr Vince.\r\n'I was there just now. I have an infallible system.'\r\n\r\nMr Warden started like a war-horse at the sound of the trumpet.\r\n\r\n'Only it's infallible the wrong way,' went on the young man. 'Well, I\r\nwish you luck. I'll see Miss Warden home.'\r\n\r\n'Please don't trouble,' said Ruth, in the haughty manner which had\r\nfrequently withered unfortunate fellow-exiles in their tracks.\r\n\r\nIt had no such effect on Mr Vince.\r\n\r\n'I shall like it,' he said.\r\n\r\nRuth set her teeth. She would see whether he would like it.\r\n\r\nThey left Mr Warden, who shot in at the casino door like a homing\r\nrabbit, and walked on in silence, which lasted till Ruth, suddenly\r\nbecoming aware that her companion's eyes were fixed on her face, turned\r\nher head, to meet a gaze of complete, not to say loving, admiration.\r\nShe flushed. She was accustomed to being looked at admiringly, but\r\nabout this particular look there was a subtle quality that\r\ndistinguished it from the ordinary--something proprietorial.\r\n\r\nMr Vince appeared to be a young man who wasted no time on conventional\r\nconversation-openings.\r\n\r\n'Do you believe in affinities, Miss Warden?' he said,\r\n\r\n'No,' said Ruth.\r\n\r\n'You will before we've done,' said Mr Vince, confidently. 'Why did you\r\ntry to snub me just now?'\r\n\r\n'Did I?'\r\n\r\n'You mustn't again. It hurts me. I'm a sensitive man. Diffident. Shy.\r\nMiss Warden, will you marry me?'\r\n\r\nRuth had determined that nothing should shake her from her icy\r\ndetachment, but this did. She stopped with a gasp, and stared at him.\r\n\r\nMr Vince reassured her.\r\n\r\n'I don't expect you to say \"Yes\". That was just a beginning--the shot\r\nfired across the bows by way of warning. In you, Miss Warden, I have\r\nfound my affinity. Have you ever considered this matter of affinities?\r\nAffinities are the--the--Wait a moment.'\r\n\r\nHe paused, reflecting.\r\n\r\n'I--' began Ruth.\r\n\r\n''Sh!' said the young man, holding up his hand.\r\n\r\nRuth's eyes flashed. She was not used to having ''Sh!' said to her by\r\nyoung men, and she resented it.\r\n\r\n'I've got it,' he declared, with relief. 'I knew I should, but these\r\ngood things take time. Affinities are the zero on the roulette-board of\r\nlife. Just as we select a number on which to stake our money, so do we\r\nselect a type of girl whom we think we should like to marry. And just\r\nas zero pops up instead of the number, so does our affinity come along\r\nand upset all our pre-conceived notions of the type of girl we should\r\nlike to marry.'\r\n\r\n'I--' began Ruth again.\r\n\r\n'The analogy is in the rough at present. I haven't had time to condense\r\nand polish it. But you see the idea. Take my case, for instance. When I\r\nsaw you a couple of days ago I knew in an instant that you were my\r\naffinity. But for years I had been looking for a woman almost your\r\nexact opposite. You are dark. Three days ago I couldn't have imagined\r\nmyself marrying anyone who was not fair. Your eyes are grey. Three days\r\nago my preference for blue eyes was a by-word. You have a shocking\r\ntemper. Three days ago--'\r\n\r\n'Mr Vince!'\r\n\r\n'There!' said that philosopher, complacently. 'You stamped. The gentle,\r\nblue-eyed blonde whom I was looking for three days ago would have\r\ndrooped timidly. Three days ago my passion for timid droopers amounted\r\nto an obsession.'\r\n\r\nRuth did not reply. It was useless to bandy words with one who gave\r\nsuch clear evidence of being something out of the common run of\r\nword-bandiers. No verbal attack could crush this extraordinary young\r\nman. She walked on, all silence and stony profile, uncomfortably\r\nconscious that her companion was in no way abashed by the former and\r\nwas regarding the latter with that frank admiration which had made\r\nitself so obnoxious to her before, until they reached their destination.\r\nMr Vince, meanwhile, chatted cheerfully, and pointed out objects of\r\ninterest by the wayside.\r\n\r\nAt the door Ruth permitted herself a word of farewell.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Till tomorrow evening,' said Mr Vince. 'I shall be coming to dinner.'\r\n\r\nMr Warden ambled home, very happy and contented, two hours later, with\r\nhalf a franc in his pocket, this comparative wealth being due to the\r\nfact that the minimum stake permitted by the Roville casino is just\r\ndouble that sum. He was sorry not to have won, but his mind was too\r\nfull of rosy dreams to permit of remorse. It was the estimable old\r\ngentleman's dearest wish that his daughter should marry some rich,\r\nopen-handed man who would keep him in affluence for the remainder of\r\nhis days, and to that end he was in the habit of introducing to her\r\nnotice any such that came his way. There was no question of coercing\r\nRuth. He was too tender-hearted for that. Besides he couldn't. Ruth was\r\nnot the sort of girl who is readily coerced. He contented himself with\r\ngiving her the opportunity to inspect his exhibits. Roville is a\r\nsociable place, and it was not unusual for him to make friends at the\r\ncasino and to bring them home, when made, for a cigar. Up to the\r\npresent, he was bound to admit, his efforts had not been particularly\r\nsuccessful. Ruth, he reflected sadly, was a curious girl. She did not\r\nshow her best side to these visitors. There was no encouragement in her\r\nmanner. She was apt to frighten the unfortunate exhibits. But of this\r\nyoung man Vince he had brighter hopes. He was rich. That was proved by\r\nthe very handsome way in which he had behaved in the matter of a small\r\nloan when, looking in at the casino after parting from Ruth, he had\r\nfound Mr Warden in sore straits for want of a little capital to back a\r\nbrand-new system which he had conceived through closely observing the\r\nrun of the play. He was also obviously attracted by Ruth. And, as he\r\nwas remarkably presentable--indeed, quite an unusually good-looking\r\nyoung man--there seemed no reason why Ruth should not be equally\r\nattracted by him. The world looked good to Mr Warden as he fell asleep\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nRuth did not fall asleep so easily. The episode had disturbed her. A\r\nnew element had entered her life, and one that gave promise of\r\nproducing strange by-products.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the following evening, Ruth returned from the stroll on the\r\nPromenade which she always took after leaving the _mont-de-piete_,\r\nwith a feeling of irritation towards things in general, this feeling\r\nwas not diminished by the sight of Mr Vince, very much at his ease,\r\nstanding against the mantelpiece of the tiny parlour.\r\n\r\n'How do you do?' he said. 'By an extraordinary coincidence I happened\r\nto be hanging about outside this house just now, when your father came\r\nalong and invited me in to dinner. Have you ever thought much about\r\ncoincidences, Miss Warden? To my mind, they may be described as the\r\nzero on the roulette-board of life.'\r\n\r\nHe regarded her fondly.\r\n\r\n'For a shy man, conscious that the girl he loves is inspecting him\r\nclosely and making up her mind about him,' he proceeded, 'these\r\nunexpected meetings are very trying ordeals. You must not form your\r\njudgement of me too hastily. You see me now, nervous, embarrassed,\r\ntongue-tied. But I am not always like this. Beneath this crust of\r\ndiffidence there is sterling stuff, Miss Warden. People who know me\r\nhave spoken of me as a little ray of sun--But here is your father.'\r\n\r\nMr Warden was more than usually disappointed with Ruth during dinner.\r\nIt was the same old story. So far from making herself pleasant to this\r\nattractive stranger, she seemed positively to dislike him. She was\r\nbarely civil to him. With a sigh Mr Warden told himself that he did not\r\nunderstand Ruth, and the rosy dreams he had formed began to fade.\r\n\r\nRuth's ideas on the subject of Mr Vince as the days went by were\r\nchaotic. Though she told herself that she thoroughly objected to him,\r\nhe had nevertheless begun to have an undeniable attraction for her. In\r\nwhat this attraction consisted she could not say. When she tried to\r\nanalyse it, she came to the conclusion that it was due to the fact that\r\nhe was the only element in her life that made for excitement. Since his\r\nadvent the days had certainly passed more swiftly for her. The dead\r\nlevel of monotony had been broken. There was a certain fascination in\r\nexerting herself to suppress him, which increased daily as each attempt\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nMr Vince put this feeling into words for her. He had a maddening habit\r\nof discussing the progress of his courtship in the manner of an\r\nimpartial lecturer.\r\n\r\n'I am making headway,' he observed. 'The fact that we cannot meet\r\nwithout your endeavouring to plant a temperamental left jab on my\r\nspiritual solar plexus encourages me to think that you are beginning at\r\nlast to understand that we are affinities. To persons of spirit like\r\nourselves the only happy marriage is that which is based on a firm\r\nfoundation of almost incessant quarrelling. The most beautiful line in\r\nEnglish poetry, to my mind, is, \"We fell out, my wife and I.\" You would\r\nbe wretched with a husband who didn't like you to quarrel with him. The\r\nposition of affairs now is that I have become necessary to you. If I\r\nwent out of your life now I should leave an aching void. You would\r\nstill have that beautiful punch of yours, and there would be nobody to\r\nexercise it on. You would pine away. From now on matters should, I\r\nthink, move rapidly. During the course of the next week I shall\r\nendeavour to propitiate you with gifts. Here is the first of them.'\r\n\r\nHe took a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it her. It was a\r\npencil-sketch, rough and unfinished, but wonderfully clever. Even Ruth\r\ncould appreciate that--and she was a prejudiced observer, for the\r\nsketch was a caricature of herself. It represented her, drawn up to her\r\nfull height, with enormous, scornful eyes and curling lips, and the\r\nartist had managed to combine an excellent likeness while accentuating\r\neverything that was marked in what she knew had come to be her normal\r\nexpression of scorn and discontent.\r\n\r\n'I didn't know you were an artist, Mr Vince,' she said, handing it\r\nback.\r\n\r\n'A poor amateur. Nothing more. You may keep it.'\r\n\r\n'I have not the slightest wish to keep it.'\r\n\r\n'You haven't?'\r\n\r\n'It is not in the least clever, and it is very impertinent of you to\r\nshow it to me. The drawing is not funny. It is simply rude.'\r\n\r\n'A little more,' said Mr Vince, 'and I shall begin to think you don't\r\nlike it. Are you fond of chocolates?'\r\n\r\nRuth did not answer.\r\n\r\n'I am sending you some tomorrow.'\r\n\r\n'I shall return them.'\r\n\r\n'Then I shall send some more, and some fruit. Gifts!' soliloquized Mr\r\nVince. 'Gifts! That is the secret. Keep sending gifts. If men would\r\nonly stick to gifts and quarrelling, there would be fewer bachelors.'\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, as promised, the chocolates arrived, many pounds of them\r\nin a lordly box. The bludgeoning of fate had not wholly scotched in\r\nRuth a human weakness for sweets, and it was with a distinct effort\r\nthat she wrapped the box up again and returned it to the sender. She\r\nwent off to her work at the _mont-de-piete_ with a glow of\r\nsatisfaction which comes to those who exhibit an iron will in trying\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAnd at the _mont-de-piete_ there occurred a surprising incident.\r\n\r\nSurprising incidents, as Mr Vince would have said, are the zero on the\r\nroulette-board of life. They pop up disturbingly when least expected,\r\nconfusing the mind and altering pre-conceived opinions. And this was a\r\nvery surprising incident indeed.\r\n\r\nRuth, as has been stated, sat during her hours of work behind a\r\nground-glass screen, unseen and unseeing. To her the patrons of the\r\nestablishment were mere disembodied voices--wheedling voices, pathetic\r\nvoices, voices that protested, voices that hectored, voices that\r\nwhined, moaned, broke, appealed to the saints, and in various other\r\nways endeavoured to instil into M. Gandinot more spacious and princely\r\nviews on the subject of advancing money on property pledged. She was\r\nsitting behind her screen this morning, scribbling idly on the\r\nblotting-pad, for there had been a lull in the business, when the door\r\nopened, and the polite, 'Bonjour, monsieur,' of M. Gandinot announced\r\nthe arrival of another unfortunate.\r\n\r\nAnd then, shaking her like an electric shock, came a voice that she\r\nknew--the pleasant voice of Mr Vince.\r\n\r\nThe dialogues that took place on the other side of the screen were\r\noften protracted and always sordid, but none had seemed to Ruth so\r\ninterminable, so hideously sordid, as this one.\r\n\r\nRound and round its miserable centre--a silver cigarette-case--the\r\ndreary argument circled. The young man pleaded; M. Gandinot, adamant in\r\nhis official role, was immovable.\r\n\r\nRuth could bear it no longer. She pressed her hands over her burning\r\nears, and the voices ceased to trouble her.\r\n\r\nAnd with the silence came thought, and a blaze of understanding that\r\nflashed upon her and made all things clear. She understood now why she\r\nhad closed her ears.\r\n\r\nPoverty is an acid which reacts differently on differing natures. It\r\nhad reduced Mr Eugene Warden's self-respect to a minimum. Ruth's it had\r\nreared up to an abnormal growth. Her pride had become a weed that ran\r\nriot in her soul, darkening it and choking finer emotions. Perhaps it\r\nwas her father's naive stratagems for the enmeshing of a wealthy\r\nhusband that had produced in her at last a morbid antipathy to the\r\nidea of playing beggar-maid to any man's King Cophetua. The state of\r\nmind is intelligible. The Cophetua legend never has been told from the\r\nbeggar-maid's point of view, and there must have been moments when, if\r\na woman of spirit, she resented that monarch's somewhat condescending\r\nattitude, and felt that, secure in his wealth and magnificence, he had\r\ntaken her grateful acquiescence very much for granted.\r\n\r\nThis, she saw now, was what had prejudiced her against George Vince.\r\nShe had assumed that he was rich. He had conveyed the impression of\r\nbeing rich. And she had been on the defensive against him accordingly.\r\nNow, for the first time, she seemed to know him. A barrier had been\r\nbroken down. The royal robes had proved tinsel, and no longer disguised\r\nthe man she loved.\r\n\r\nA touch on her arm aroused her. M. Gandinot was standing by her side.\r\nTerms, apparently had been agreed upon and the interview concluded, for\r\nin his hand was a silver cigarette-case.\r\n\r\n'Dreaming, mademoiselle? I could not make you hear. The more I call to\r\nyou, the more you did not answer. It is necessary to enter this loan.'\r\n\r\nHe recited the details and Ruth entered them in her ledger. This done,\r\nM. Gandinot, doffing his official self, sighed.\r\n\r\n'It is a place of much sorrow, mademoiselle, this office. How he would\r\nnot take no for an answer, that young man, recently departed. A\r\nfellow-countryman of yours, mademoiselle. You would say, \"What does this\r\nyoung man, so well-dressed, in a _mont-de-piete_?\" But I know\r\nbetter, I, Gandinot. You have an expression, you English--I heard it in\r\nParis in a cafe, and inquired its meaning--when you say of a man that he\r\nswanks. How many young men have I seen here, admirably dressed--rich,\r\nyou would say. No, no. The _mont-de-piete_ permits no secrets. To\r\nswank, mademoiselle, what is it? To deceive the world, yes. But not the\r\n_mont-de-piete_. Yesterday also, when you had departed, was he\r\nhere, that young man. Yet here he is once more today. He spends his\r\nmoney quickly, alas! that poor young swanker.'\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth returned home that evening she found her father in the\r\nsitting-room, smoking a cigarette. He greeted her with effusion, but\r\nwith some uneasiness--for the old gentleman had nerved himself to a\r\ndelicate task. He had made up his mind tonight to speak seriously to\r\nRuth on the subject of her unsatisfactory behaviour to Mr Vince. The\r\nmore he saw of that young man the more positive was he that this was\r\nthe human gold-mine for which he had been searching all these weary\r\nyears. Accordingly, he threw away his cigarette, kissed Ruth on the\r\nforehead, and began to speak.\r\n\r\nIt had long been Mr Warden's opinion that, if his daughter had a fault,\r\nit was a tendency towards a quite unnecessary and highly inconvenient\r\nfrankness. She had not that tact which he would have liked a daughter\r\nof his to possess. She would not evade, ignore, agree not to see. She\r\nwas at times painfully blunt.\r\n\r\nThis happened now. He was warming to his subject when she interrupted\r\nhim with a question.\r\n\r\n'What makes you think Mr Vince is rich, father?' she asked.\r\n\r\nMr Warden was embarrassed. The subject of Mr Vince's opulence had not\r\nentered into his discourse. He had carefully avoided it. The fact that\r\nhe was thinking of it and that Ruth knew that he was thinking of it,\r\nand that he knew that Ruth knew, had nothing to do with the case. The\r\nquestion was not in order, and it embarrassed him.\r\n\r\n'I--why--I don't--I never said he was rich, my dear. I have no doubt\r\nthat he has ample--'\r\n\r\n'He is quite poor.'\r\n\r\nMr Warden's jaw fell slightly.\r\n\r\n'Poor? But, my dear, that's absurd!' he cried. 'Why, only this\r\nevening--'\r\n\r\nHe broke off abruptly, but it was too late.\r\n\r\n'Father, you've been borrowing money from him!'\r\n\r\nMr Warden drew in his breath, preparatory to an indignant denial, but\r\nhe altered his mind and remained silent. As a borrower of money he had\r\nevery quality but one. He had come to look on her perspicacity in this\r\nmatter as a sort of second sight. It had frequently gone far to\r\nspoiling for him the triumph of success.\r\n\r\n'And he has to pawn things to live!' Her voice trembled. 'He was at the\r\n_mont-de-piete_ today. And yesterday too. I heard him. He was\r\narguing with M. Gandinot--haggling--'\r\n\r\nHer voice broke. She was sobbing helplessly. The memory of it was too\r\nraw and vivid.\r\n\r\nMr Warden stood motionless. Many emotions raced through his mind, but\r\nchief among them the thought that this revelation had come at a very\r\nfortunate time. An exceedingly lucky escape, he felt. He was aware,\r\nalso, of a certain measure of indignation against this deceitful young\r\nman who had fraudulently imitated a gold-mine with what might have been\r\ndisastrous results.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Jeanne, the maid-of-all-work, announced Mr Vince.\r\n\r\nHe entered the room briskly.\r\n\r\n'Good evening!' he said. 'I have brought you some more chocolates, Miss\r\nWarden, and some fruit. Great Scott! What's the matter?'\r\n\r\nHe stopped, but only for an instant. The next he had darted across the\r\nroom, and, before the horrified eyes of Mr Warden, was holding Ruth in\r\nhis arms. She clung to him.\r\n\r\nBill, the fox-terrier, over whom Mr Vince had happened to stumble, was\r\nthe first to speak. Almost simultaneously Mr Warden joined in, and\r\nthere was a striking similarity between the two voices, for Mr Warden,\r\nsearching for words, emitted as a preliminary to them a sort of\r\npassionate yelp.\r\n\r\nMr Vince removed the hand that was patting Ruth's shoulder and waved it\r\nreassuringly at him.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' he said.\r\n\r\n'All right! All _right_!'\r\n\r\n'Affinities,' explained Mr Vince over his shoulder. 'Two hearts that\r\nbeat as one. We're going to be married. What's the matter, dear? Don't\r\nyou worry; you're all right.'\r\n\r\n'I refuse!' shouted Mr Warden. 'I absolutely refuse.'\r\n\r\nMr Vince lowered Ruth gently into a chair and, holding her hand,\r\ninspected the fermenting old gentleman gravely.\r\n\r\n'You refuse?' he said. 'Why, I thought you liked me.'\r\n\r\nMr Warden's frenzy had cooled. It had been something foreign to his\r\nnature. He regretted it. These things had to be managed with restraint.\r\n\r\n'My personal likes and dislikes,' he said, 'have nothing to do with the\r\nmatter, Mr Vince. They are beside the point. I have my daughter to\r\nconsider. I cannot allow her to marry a man without a penny.'\r\n\r\n'Quite right,' said Mr Vince, approvingly. 'Don't have anything to do\r\nwith the fellow. If he tries to butt in, send for the police.'\r\n\r\nMr Warden hesitated. He had always been a little ashamed of Ruth's\r\noccupation. But necessity compelled.\r\n\r\n'Mr Vince, my daughter is employed at the _mont-de-piete,_ and was\r\na witness to all that took place this afternoon.'\r\n\r\nMr Vince was genuinely agitated. He looked at Ruth, his face full of\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n'You don't mean to say you have been slaving away in that stuffy--Great\r\nScott! I'll have you out of that quick. You mustn't go there again.'\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you had better let me explain,' he said. 'Explanations, I\r\nalways think, are the zero on the roulette-board of life. They're\r\nalways somewhere about, waiting to pop up. Have you ever heard of\r\nVince's Stores, Mr Warden? Perhaps they are since your time. Well, my\r\nfather is the proprietor. One of our specialities is children's toys,\r\nbut we haven't picked a real winner for years, and my father when I\r\nlast saw him seemed so distressed about it that I said I'd see if I\r\ncouldn't whack out an idea for something. Something on the lines of the\r\nBilliken, only better, was what he felt he needed. I'm not used to\r\nbrain work, and after a spell of it I felt I wanted a rest. I came here\r\nto recuperate, and the very first morning I got an inspiration. You may\r\nhave noticed that the manager of the _mont-de-piete_ here isn't\r\nstrong on conventional good looks. I saw him at the casino, and the\r\nthing flashed on me. He thinks his name's Gandinot, but it isn't. It's\r\nUncle Zip, the Hump-Curer, the Man who Makes You Smile.'\r\n\r\nHe pressed Ruth's hand affectionately.\r\n\r\n'I lost track of him, and it was only the day before yesterday that I\r\ndiscovered who he was and where he was to be found. Well, you can't go\r\nup to a man and ask him to pose as a model for Uncle Zip, the\r\nHump-Curer. The only way to get sittings was to approach him in the\r\nway of business. So I collected what property I had and waded in.\r\nThat's the whole story. Do I pass?'\r\n\r\nMr Warden's frosty demeanour had gradually thawed during this recital,\r\nand now the sun of his smile shone out warmly. He gripped Mr Vince's\r\nhand with every evidence of esteem, and after that he did what was\r\ncertainly the best thing, by passing gently from the room. On his face,\r\nas he went, was a look such as Moses might have worn on the summit of\r\nPisgah.\r\n\r\nIt was some twenty minutes later that Ruth made a remark.\r\n\r\n'I want you to promise me something,' she said. 'Promise that you\r\nwon't go on with that Uncle Zip drawing. I know it means ever so much\r\nmoney, but it might hurt poor M. Gandinot's feelings, and he has been\r\nvery kind to me.'\r\n\r\n'That settles it,' said Mr Vince. 'It's hard on the children of Great\r\nBritain, but say no more. No Uncle Zip for them.'\r\n\r\nRuth looked at him, almost with awe.\r\n\r\n'You really won't go on with it? In spite of all the money you would\r\nmake? Are you always going to do just what I ask you, no matter what it\r\ncosts you?'\r\n\r\nHe nodded sadly.\r\n\r\n'You have sketched out in a few words the whole policy of my married\r\nlife. I feel an awful fraud. And I had encouraged you to look forward\r\nto years of incessant quarrelling. Do you think you can manage without\r\nit? I'm afraid it's going to be shockingly dull for you,' said Mr\r\nVince, regretfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHIBALD'S BENEFIT\r\n\r\n\r\nArchibald Mealing was one of those golfers in whom desire outruns\r\nperformance. Nobody could have been more willing than Archibald. He\r\ntried, and tried hard. Every morning before he took his bath he would\r\nstand in front of his mirror and practise swings. Every night before he\r\nwent to bed he would read the golden words of some master on the\r\nsubject of putting, driving, or approaching. Yet on the links most of\r\nhis time was spent in retrieving lost balls or replacing America.\r\nWhether it was that Archibald pressed too much or pressed too little,\r\nwhether it was that his club deviated from the dotted line which joined\r\nthe two points A and B in the illustrated plate of the man making the\r\nbrassy shot in the _Hints on Golf_ book, or whether it was that he\r\nwas pursued by some malignant fate, I do not know. Archibald rather\r\nfavoured the last theory.\r\n\r\nThe important point is that, in his thirty-first year, after six\r\nseasons of untiring effort, Archibald went in for a championship, and\r\nwon it.\r\n\r\nArchibald, mark you, whose golf was a kind of blend of hockey, Swedish\r\ndrill, and buck-and-wing dancing.\r\n\r\nI know the ordeal I must face when I make such a statement. I see\r\nclearly before me the solid phalanx of men from Missouri, some urging\r\nme to tell it to the King of Denmark, others insisting that I produce\r\nmy Eskimos. Nevertheless, I do not shrink. I state once more that in\r\nhis thirty-first year Archibald Mealing went in for a golf\r\nchampionship, and won it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArchibald belonged to a select little golf club, the members of which\r\nlived and worked in New York, but played in Jersey. Men of substance,\r\nfinancially as well as physically, they had combined their superfluous\r\ncash and with it purchased a strip of land close to the sea. This land\r\nhad been drained--to the huge discomfort of a colony of mosquitoes\r\nwhich had come to look on the place as their private property--and\r\nconverted into links, which had become a sort of refuge for incompetent\r\ngolfers. The members of the Cape Pleasant Club were easygoing refugees\r\nfrom other and more exacting clubs, men who pottered rather than raced\r\nround the links; men, in short, who had grown tired of having to stop\r\ntheir game and stand aside in order to allow perspiring experts to whiz\r\npast them. The Cape Pleasant golfers did not make themselves slaves to\r\nthe game. Their language, when they foozled, was gently regretful\r\nrather than sulphurous. The moment in the day's play which they enjoyed\r\nmost was when they were saying: 'Well, here's luck!' in the club-house.\r\n\r\nIt will, therefore, be readily understood that Archibald's inability to\r\ndo a hole in single figures did not handicap him at Cape Pleasant as it\r\nmight have done at St. Andrews. His kindly clubmates took him to their\r\nbosoms to a man, and looked on him as a brother. Archibald's was one of\r\nthose admirable natures which prompt their possessor frequently to\r\nremark: 'These are on me!' and his fellow golfers were not slow to\r\nappreciate the fact. They all loved Archibald.\r\n\r\nArchibald was on the floor of his bedroom one afternoon, picking up the\r\nfragments of his mirror--a friend had advised him to practise the\r\nWalter J. Travis lofting shot--when the telephone bell rang. He took up\r\nthe receiver, and was hailed by the comfortable voice of McCay, the\r\nclub secretary.\r\n\r\n'Is that Mealing?' asked McCay. 'Say, Archie, I'm putting your name\r\ndown for our championship competition. That's right, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Sure,' said Archibald. 'When does it start?'\r\n\r\n'Next Saturday.'\r\n\r\n'That's me.'\r\n\r\n'Good for you. Oh, Archie.'\r\n\r\n'Hello?'\r\n\r\n'A man I met today told me you were engaged. Is that a fact?'\r\n\r\n'Sure,' murmured Archibald, blushfully.\r\n\r\nThe wire hummed with McCay's congratulations.\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said Archibald. 'Thanks, old man. What? Oh, yes. Milsom's her\r\nname. By the way, her family have taken a cottage at Cape Pleasant for\r\nthe summer. Some distance from the links. Yes, very convenient, isn't\r\nit? Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nHe hung up the receiver and resumed his task of gathering up the\r\nfragments. Now McCay happened to be of a romantic and sentimental\r\nnature. He was by profession a chartered accountant, and inclined to be\r\nstout; and all rather stout chartered accountants are sentimental.\r\nMcCay was the sort of man who keeps old ball programmes and bundles of\r\nletters tied round with lilac ribbon. At country houses, where they\r\nlingered in the porch after dinner to watch the moonlight flooding the\r\nquiet garden, it was McCay and his colleague who lingered longest.\r\nMcCay knew Ella Wheeler Wilcox by heart, and could take Browning\r\nwithout anaesthetics. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that\r\nArchibald's remark about his fiancee coming to live at Cape Pleasant\r\nshould give him food for thought. It appealed to him.\r\n\r\nHe reflected on it a good deal during the day, and, running across\r\nSigsbee, a fellow Cape Pleasanter, after dinner that night at the\r\nSybarites' Club, he spoke of the matter to him. It so happened that\r\nboth had dined excellently, and were looking on the world with a sort\r\nof cosy benevolence. They were in the mood when men pat small boys on\r\nthe head and ask them if they mean to be President when they grow up.\r\n\r\n'I called up Archie Mealing today,' said McCay. 'Did you know he was\r\nengaged?'\r\n\r\n'I did hear something about it. Girl of the name of Wilson, or--'\r\n\r\n'Milsom. She's going to spend the summer at Cape Pleasant, Archie tells\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'Then she'll have a chance of seeing him play in the championship\r\ncompetition.'\r\n\r\nMcCay sucked his cigar in silence for a while, watching with dreamy\r\neyes the blue smoke as it curled ceiling-ward. When he spoke his voice\r\nwas singularly soft.\r\n\r\n'Do you know, Sigsbee,' he said, sipping his Maraschino with a gentle\r\nmelancholy--'do you know, there is something wonderfully pathetic to me\r\nin this business. I see the whole thing so clearly. There was a kind of\r\nquiver in the poor old chap's voice when he said: \"She is coming to\r\nCape Pleasant,\" which told me more than any words could have done. It\r\nis a tragedy in its way, Sigsbee. We may smile at it, think it trivial;\r\nbut it is none the less a tragedy. That warm-hearted, enthusiastic\r\ngirl, all eagerness to see the man she loves do well--Archie, poor old\r\nArchie, all on fire to prove to her that her trust in him is not\r\nmisplaced, and the end--Disillusionment--Disappointment--Unhappiness.'\r\n\r\n'He ought to keep his eye on the ball,' said the more practical\r\nSigsbee.\r\n\r\n'Quite possibly,' continued McCay, 'he has told her that he will win\r\nthis championship.'\r\n\r\n'If Archie's mutt enough to have told her that,' said Sigsbee\r\ndecidedly, 'he deserves all he gets. Waiter, two Scotch highballs.'\r\n\r\nMcCay was in no mood to subscribe to this stony-hearted view.\r\n\r\n'I tell you,' he said, 'I'm _sorry_ for Archie! I'm _sorry_\r\nfor the poor old chap. And I'm more than sorry for the girl.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't see what we can do,' said Sigsbee. 'We can hardly be\r\nexpected to foozle on purpose, just to let Archie show off before his\r\ngirl.'\r\n\r\nMcCay paused in the act of lighting his cigar, as one smitten with a\r\ngreat thought.\r\n\r\n'Why not?' he said. 'Why not, Sigsbee? Sigsbee, you've hit it.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'You have! I tell you, Sigsbee, you've solved the whole thing. Archie's\r\nsuch a bully good fellow, why not give him a benefit? Why not let him\r\nwin this championship? You aren't going to tell me that you care\r\nwhether you win a tin medal or not?'\r\n\r\nSigsbee's benevolence was expanding under the influence of the Scotch\r\nhighball and his cigar. Little acts of kindness on Archie's part, here\r\na cigar, there a lunch, at another time seats for the theatre, began to\r\nrise to the surface of his memory like rainbow-coloured bubbles. He\r\nwavered.\r\n\r\n'Yes, but what about the rest of the men?' he said. 'There will be a\r\ndozen or more in for the medal.'\r\n\r\n'We can square them,' said McCay confidently. 'We will broach the\r\nmatter to them at a series of dinners at which we will be joint hosts.\r\nThey are white men who will be charmed to do a little thing like that\r\nfor a sport like Archie.'\r\n\r\n'How about Gossett?' said Sigsbee.\r\n\r\nMcCay's face clouded. Gossett was an unpopular subject with members of\r\nthe Cape Pleasant Golf Club. He was the serpent in their Eden. Nobody\r\nseemed quite to know how he had got in, but there, unfortunately, he\r\nwas. Gossett had introduced into Cape Pleasant golf a cheerless\r\natmosphere of the rigour of the game. It was to enable them to avoid\r\njust such golfers as Gossett that the Cape Pleasanters had founded\r\ntheir club. Genial courtesy rather than strict attention to the rules\r\nhad been the leading characteristics of their play till his arrival. Up\r\nto that time it had been looked on as rather bad form to exact a\r\npenalty. A cheery give-and-take system had prevailed. Then Gossett had\r\ncome, full of strange rules, and created about the same stir in the\r\ncommunity which a hawk would create in a gathering of middle-aged\r\ndoves.\r\n\r\n'You can't square Gossett,' said Sigsbee.\r\n\r\nMcCay looked unhappy.\r\n\r\n'I forgot him,' he said. 'Of course, nothing will stop him trying to\r\nwin. I wish we could think of something. I would almost as soon see him\r\nlose as Archie win. But, after all, he does have off days sometimes.'\r\n\r\n'You need to have a very off day to be as bad as Archie.'\r\n\r\nThey sat and smoked in silence.\r\n\r\n'I've got it,' said Sigsbee suddenly. 'Gossett is a fine golfer, but\r\nnervous. If we upset his nerves enough, he will go right off his\r\nstroke. Couldn't we think of some way?'\r\n\r\nMcCay reached out for his glass.\r\n\r\n'Yours is a noble nature, Sigsbee,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no,' said the paragon modestly. 'Have another cigar?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may get the mental half-Nelson on the plot of\r\nthis narrative which is so essential if a short story is to charm,\r\nelevate, and instruct, it is necessary now, for the nonce (but only for\r\nthe nonce), to inspect Archibald's past life.\r\n\r\nArchibald, as he had stated to McCay, was engaged to a Miss\r\nMilsom--Miss Margaret Milsom. How few men, dear reader, are engaged to\r\ngirls with _svelte_ figures, brown hair, and large blue eyes, now\r\nsparkling and vivacious, now dreamy and soulful, but always large and\r\nblue! How few, I say. You are, dear reader, and so am I, but who else?\r\nArchibald was one of the few who happened to be.\r\n\r\nHe was happy. It is true that Margaret's mother was not, as it were,\r\nwrapped up in him. She exhibited none of that effervescent joy at his\r\nappearance which we like to see in our mothers-in-law elect. On the\r\ncontrary, she generally cried bitterly whenever she saw him, and at the\r\nend of ten minutes was apt to retire sobbing to her room, where she\r\nremained in a state of semi-coma till an advanced hour. She was by way\r\nof being a confirmed invalid, and something about Archibald seemed to\r\nget right in among her nerve centres, reducing them for the time being\r\nto a complicated hash. She did not like Archibald. She said she liked\r\nbig, manly men. Behind his back she not infrequently referred to him as\r\na 'gaby'; sometimes even as that 'guffin'.\r\n\r\nShe did not do this to Margaret, for Margaret, besides being blue-eyed,\r\nwas also a shade quick-tempered. Whenever she discussed Archibald, it\r\nwas with her son Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant Milsom, who thought Archibald a\r\nbit of an ass, was always ready to sit and listen to his mother on the\r\nsubject, it being, however, an understood thing that at the conclusion\r\nof the seance she yielded one or two saffron-coloured bills towards his\r\nracing debts. For Stuyvesant, having developed a habit of backing\r\nhorses which either did not start at all or else sat down and thought\r\nin the middle of the race, could always do with ten dollars or so. His\r\nprices for these interviews worked out, as a rule, at about three cents\r\na word.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it was perhaps natural that Archibald and\r\nMargaret should prefer to meet, when they did meet, at some other spot\r\nthan the Milsom home. It suited them both better that they should\r\narrange a secret tryst on these occasions. Archibald preferred it\r\nbecause being in the same room as Mrs Milsom always made him feel like\r\na murderer with particularly large feet; and Margaret preferred it\r\nbecause, as she told Archibald, these secret meetings lent a touch of\r\npoetry to what might otherwise have been a commonplace engagement.\r\n\r\nArchibald thought this charming; but at the same time he could not\r\nconceal from himself the fact that Margaret's passion for the poetic\r\ncut, so to speak, both ways. He admired and loved the loftiness of her\r\nsoul, but, on the other hand, it was a tough job having to live up to\r\nit. For Archibald was a very ordinary young man. They had tried to\r\ninoculate him with a love of poetry at school, but it had not taken.\r\nUntil he was thirty he had been satisfied to class all poetry (except\r\nthat of Mr George Cohan) under the general heading of punk. Then he met\r\nMargaret, and the trouble began. On the day he first met her, at a\r\npicnic, she had looked so soulful, so aloof from this world, that he\r\nhad felt instinctively that here was a girl who expected more from a\r\nman than a mere statement that the weather was great. It so chanced\r\nthat he knew just one quotation from the classics, to wit, Tennyson's\r\ncritique of the Island-Valley of Avilion. He knew this because he had\r\nhad the passage to write out one hundred and fifty times at school, on\r\nthe occasion of his being caught smoking by one of the faculty who\r\nhappened to be a passionate admirer of the 'Idylls of the King'.\r\n\r\nA remark of Margaret's that it was a splendid day for a picnic and that\r\nthe country looked nice gave him his opportunity.\r\n\r\n'It reminds me,' he said, 'it reminds me strongly of the Island-Valley\r\nof Avilion, where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, nor ever wind\r\nblows loudly; but it lies deep-meadow'd, happy, fair, with orchard\r\nlawns....'\r\n\r\nHe broke off here to squash a hornet; but Margaret had heard enough.\r\n'Are you fond of the poets, Mr Mealing?' she said, with a far-off look.\r\n\r\n'Me?' said Archibald fervently. 'Me? Why, I eat 'em alive!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd that was how all the trouble had started. It had meant unremitting\r\ntoil for Archibald. He felt that he had set himself a standard from\r\nwhich he must not fall. He bought every new volume of poetry which was\r\npraised in the press, and learned the reviews by heart. Every evening\r\nhe read painfully a portion of the classics. He plodded through the\r\npoetry sections of Bartlett's _Familiar Quotations_. Margaret's\r\ndevotion to the various bards was so enthusiastic, and her reading so\r\nwide, that there were times when Archibald wondered if he could endure\r\nthe strain. But he persevered heroically, and so far had not been found\r\nwanting. But the strain was fearful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe early stages of the Cape Pleasant golf tournament need no detailed\r\ndescription. The rules of match play governed the contests, and\r\nArchibald disposed of his first three opponents before the twelfth\r\nhole. He had been diffident when he teed off with McCay in the first\r\nround, but, finding that he defeated the secretary with ease, he met\r\none Butler in the second round with more confidence. Butler, too, he\r\nrouted; with the result that, by the time he faced Sigsbee in round\r\nthree, he was practically the conquering hero. Fortune seemed to be\r\nbeaming upon him with almost insipid sweetness. When he was trapped in\r\nthe bunker at the seventh hole, Sigsbee became trapped as well. When he\r\nsliced at the sixth tee, Sigsbee pulled. And Archibald, striking a\r\nbrilliant vein, did the next three holes in eleven, nine, and twelve;\r\nand, romping home, qualified for the final.\r\n\r\nGossett, that serpent, meanwhile, had beaten each of his three\r\nopponents without much difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe final was fixed for the following Thursday morning. Gossett, who\r\nwas a broker, had made some frivolous objection about the difficulty of\r\nabsenting himself from Wall Street, but had been overruled. When\r\nSigsbee pointed out that he could easily defeat Archibald and get to\r\nthe city by lunch-time if he wished, and that in any case his partner\r\nwould be looking after things, he allowed himself to be persuaded,\r\nthough reluctantly. It was a well-known fact that Gossett was in the\r\nmidst of some rather sizeable deals at that time.\r\n\r\nThursday morning suited Archibald admirably. It had occurred to him\r\nthat he could bring off a double event. Margaret had arrived at Cape\r\nPleasant on the previous evening, and he had arranged by telephone to\r\nmeet her at the end of the board-walk, which was about a mile from the\r\nlinks, at one o'clock, supply her with lunch, and spend the afternoon\r\nwith her on the water. If he started his match with Gossett at\r\neleven-thirty, he would have plenty of time to have his game and be at\r\nthe end of the board-walk at the appointed hour. He had no delusions\r\nabout the respective merits of Gossett and himself as golfers. He knew\r\nthat Gossett would win the necessary ten holes off the reel. It was\r\nsaddening, but it was a scientific fact. There was no avoiding it. One\r\nsimply had to face it.\r\n\r\nHaving laid these plans, he caught the train on the Thursday morning\r\nwith the consoling feeling that, however sadly the morning might begin,\r\nit was bound to end well.\r\n\r\nThe day was fine, the sun warm, but tempered with a light breeze. One\r\nor two of the club had come to watch the match, among them Sigsbee.\r\n\r\nSigsbee drew Gossett aside.\r\n\r\n'You must let me caddie for you, old man,' he said. 'I know your\r\ntemperament so exactly. I know how little it takes to put you off your\r\nstroke. In an ordinary game you might take one of these boys, I know,\r\nbut on an important occasion like this you must not risk it. A grubby\r\nboy, probably with a squint, would almost certainly get on your\r\nnerves. He might even make comments on the game, or whistle. But I\r\nunderstand you. You must let me carry your clubs.'\r\n\r\n'It's very good of you,' said Gossett.\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' said Sigsbee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArchibald was now preparing to drive off from the first tee. He did\r\nthis with great care. Everyone who has seen Archibald Mealing play golf\r\nknows that his teeing off is one of the most impressive sights ever\r\nwitnessed on the links. He tilted his cap over his eyes, waggled his\r\nclub a little, shifted his feet, waggled his club some more, gazed\r\nkeenly towards the horizon for a moment, waggled his club again, and\r\nfinally, with the air of a Strong Man lifting a bar of iron, raised it\r\nslowly above his head. Then, bringing it down with a sweep, he drove\r\nthe ball with a lofty slice some fifty yards. It was rarely that he\r\nfailed either to slice or pull his ball. His progress from hole to hole\r\nwas generally a majestic zigzag.\r\n\r\nGossett's drive took him well on the way to the green. He holed out in\r\nfive. Archibald, mournful but not surprised, made his way to the second\r\ntee.\r\n\r\nThe second hole was shorter. Gossett won it in three. The third he took\r\nin six, the fourth in four. Archibald began to feel that he might just\r\nas well not be there. He was practically a spectator.\r\n\r\nAt this point he reached in his pocket for his tobacco-pouch, to\r\nconsole himself with smoke. To his dismay he found it was not there. He\r\nhad had it in the train, but now it had vanished. This added to his\r\ngloom, for the pouch had been given to him by Margaret, and he had\r\nalways thought it one more proof of the way her nature towered over the\r\nnatures of other girls that she had not woven a monogram on it in\r\nforget-me-nots. This record pouch was missing, and Archibald mourned\r\nfor the loss.\r\n\r\nHis sorrows were not alleviated by the fact that Gossett won the fifth\r\nand sixth holes.\r\n\r\nIt was now a quarter past twelve, and Archibald reflected with moody\r\nsatisfaction that the massacre must soon be over, and that he would\r\nthen be able to forget it in the society of Margaret.\r\n\r\nAs Gossett was about to drive off from the seventh tee, a telegraph boy\r\napproached the little group.\r\n\r\n'Mr Gossett,' he said.\r\n\r\nGossett lowered his driver, and wheeled round, but Sigsbee had snatched\r\nthe envelope from the boy's hand.\r\n\r\n'It's all right, old man,' he said. 'Go right ahead. I'll keep it safe\r\nfor you.'\r\n\r\n'Give it to me,' said Gossett anxiously. 'It may be from the office.\r\nSomething may have happened to the market. I may be needed.'\r\n\r\n'No, no,' said Sigsbee, soothingly. 'Don't you worry about it. Better\r\nnot open it. It might have something in it that would put you off your\r\nstroke. Wait till the end of the game.'\r\n\r\n'Give it to me. I want to see it.'\r\n\r\nSigsbee was firm.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said. 'I'm here to see you win this championship and I won't\r\nhave you taking any risks. Besides, even if it was important, a few\r\nminutes won't make any difference.'\r\n\r\n'Well, at any rate, open it and read it.'\r\n\r\n'It is probably in cipher,' said Sigsbee. 'I wouldn't understand it.\r\nPlay on, old man. You've only a few more holes to win.'\r\n\r\nGossett turned and addressed his ball again. Then he swung. The club\r\ntipped the ball, and it rolled sluggishly for a couple of feet.\r\nArchibald approached the tee. Now there were moments when Archibald\r\ncould drive quite decently. He always applied a considerable amount of\r\nmuscular force to his efforts. It was in that direction, as a rule, he\r\nerred. On this occasion, whether inspired by his rival's failure or\r\nmerely favoured by chance, he connected with his ball at precisely the\r\nright moment. It flew from the tee, straight, hard, and low, struck the\r\nground near the green, bounded on and finally rocked to within a foot\r\nof the hole. No such long ball had been driven on the Cape Pleasant\r\nlinks since their foundation.\r\n\r\nThat it should have taken him three strokes to hole out from this\r\npromising position was unfortunate, but not fatal, for Gossett, who\r\nseemed suddenly to have fallen off his game, only reached the green in\r\nseven. A moment later a murmur of approval signified the fact that\r\nArchibald had won his first hole.\r\n\r\n'Mr Gossett,' said a voice.\r\n\r\nThose murmuring approval observed that the telegraph boy was once more\r\nin their midst. This time he bore two missives. Sigsbee dexterously\r\nimpounded both.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said with decision. 'I absolutely refuse to let you look at\r\nthem till the game is over. I know your temperament.'\r\n\r\nGossett gesticulated.\r\n\r\n'But they must be important. They must come from my office. Where else\r\nwould I get a stream of telegrams? Something has gone wrong. I am\r\nurgently needed.'\r\n\r\nSigsbee nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n'That is what I fear,' he said. 'That is why I cannot risk having you\r\nupset. Time enough, Gossett, for bad news after the game. Play on, man,\r\nand dismiss it from your mind. Besides, you couldn't get back to New\r\nYork just yet, in any case. There are no trains. Dismiss the whole\r\nthing from your mind and just play your usual, and you're sure to win.'\r\n\r\nArchibald had driven off during this conversation, but without his\r\nprevious success. This time he had pulled his ball into some long\r\ngrass. Gossett's drive was, however, worse; and the subsequent movement\r\nof the pair to the hole resembled more than anything else the\r\nmanoeuvres of two men rolling peanuts with toothpicks as the result of\r\nan election bet. Archibald finally took the hole in twelve after\r\nGossett had played his fourteenth.\r\n\r\nWhen Archibald won the next in eleven and the tenth in nine, hope began\r\nto flicker feebly in his bosom. But when he won two more holes,\r\nbringing the score to like-as-we-lie, it flamed up within him like a\r\nbeacon.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary golfer, whose scores per hole seldom exceed those of\r\nColonel Bogey, does not understand the whirl of mixed sensations which\r\nthe really incompetent performer experiences on the rare occasions when\r\nhe does strike a winning vein. As stroke follows stroke, and he\r\ncontinues to hold his opponent, a wild exhilaration surges through him,\r\nfollowed by a sort of awe, as if he were doing something wrong, even\r\nirreligious. Then all these yeasty emotions subside and are blended\r\ninto one glorious sensation of grandeur and majesty, as of a giant\r\namong pygmies.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Archibald, putting with the care of one brushing flies\r\noff a sleeping Venus, had holed out and won the thirteenth, he was in\r\nthe full grip of this feeling. And as he walked to the fifteenth tee,\r\nafter winning the fourteenth, he felt that this was Life, that till now\r\nhe had been a mere mollusc.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment he happened to look at his watch, and the sight was\r\nlike a douche of cold water. The hands stood at five minutes to one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us pause and ponder on this point for a while. Let us not dismiss\r\nit as if it were some mere trivial, everyday difficulty. You, dear\r\nreader, play an accurate, scientific game and beat your opponent with\r\nease every time you go the links, and so do I; but Archibald was not\r\nlike us. This was the first occasion on which he had ever felt that he\r\nwas playing well enough to give him a chance of defeating a really good\r\nman. True, he had beaten McCay, Sigsbee, and Butler in the earlier\r\nrounds; but they were ignoble rivals compared with Gossett. To defeat\r\nGossett, however, meant the championship. On the other hand, he was\r\npassionately devoted to Margaret Milsom, whom he was due to meet at the\r\nend of the board-walk at one sharp. It was now five minutes to one, and\r\nthe end of the board-walk still a mile away.\r\n\r\nThe mental struggle was brief but keen. A sharp pang, and his mind was\r\nmade up. Cost what it might, he must stay on the links. If Margaret\r\nbroke off the engagement--well, it might be that Time would heal the\r\nwound, and that after many years he would find some other girl for whom\r\nhe might come to care in a wrecked, broken sort of way. But a chance\r\nlike this could never come again. What is Love compared with holing out\r\nbefore your opponent?\r\n\r\nThe excitement now had become so intense that a small boy, following\r\nwith the crowd, swallowed his chewing-gum; for a slight improvement had\r\nbecome noticeable in Gossett's play, and a slight improvement in the\r\nplay of almost anyone meant that it became vastly superior to\r\nArchibald's. At the next hole the improvement was not marked enough to\r\nhave its full effect, and Archibald contrived to halve. This made him\r\ntwo up and three to play. What the average golfer would consider a\r\ncommanding lead. But Archibald was no average golfer. A commanding\r\nlead for him would have been two up and one to play.\r\n\r\nTo give the public of his best, your golfer should have his mind cool\r\nand intent upon the game. Inasmuch as Gossett was worrying about the\r\ntelegrams, while Archibald, strive as he might to dismiss it, was\r\nhaunted by a vision of Margaret standing alone and deserted on the\r\nboard-walk, play became, as it were, ragged. Fine putting enabled\r\nGossett to do the sixteenth hole in twelve, and when, winning the\r\nseventeenth in nine, he brought his score level with Archibald's the\r\nmatch seemed over. But just then--\r\n\r\n'Mr Gossett!' said a familiar voice.\r\n\r\nOnce more was the much-enduring telegraph boy among those present.\r\n\r\n'T'ree dis time!' he observed.\r\n\r\nGossett sprang, but again the watchful Sigsbee was too swift.\r\n\r\n'Be brave, Gossett--be brave,' he said. 'This is a crisis in the game.\r\nKeep your nerve. Play just as if nothing existed outside the links. To\r\nlook at these telegrams now would be fatal.'\r\n\r\nEye-witnesses of that great encounter will tell the story of the last\r\nhole to their dying day. It was one of those Titanic struggles which\r\nTime cannot efface from the memory. Archibald was fortunate in getting\r\na good start. He only missed twice before he struck his ball on the\r\ntee. Gossett had four strokes ere he achieved the feat. Nor did\r\nArchibald's luck desert him in the journey to the green. He was out of\r\nthe bunker in eleven.\r\n\r\nGossett emerged only after sixteen. Finally, when Archibald's\r\ntwenty-first stroke sent the ball trickling into the hole, Gossett\r\nhad played his thirtieth.\r\n\r\nThe ball had hardly rested on the bottom of the hole before Gossett had\r\nbegun to tear the telegrams from their envelopes. As he read, his eyes\r\nbulged in their sockets.\r\n\r\n'Not bad news, I hope,' said a sympathetic bystander.\r\n\r\nSigsbee took the sheaf of telegrams.\r\n\r\nThe first ran: 'Good luck. Hope you win. McCay.' The second also ran:\r\n'Good luck. Hope you win. McCay.' So, singularly enough, did the third,\r\nfourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!' said Sigsbee. 'He seems to have been pretty anxious not\r\nto run any risk of missing you, Gossett.'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Archibald, close beside him, was looking at his watch. The\r\nhands stood at a quarter to two.\r\n\r\nMargaret and her mother were seated in the parlour when Archibald\r\narrived. Mrs Milsom, who had elicited the fact that Archibald had not\r\nkept his appointment, had been saying 'I told you so' for some time,\r\nand this had not improved Margaret's temper. When, therefore,\r\nArchibald, damp and dishevelled, was shown in, the chill in the air\r\nnearly gave him frost-bite. Mrs Milsom did her celebrated imitation of\r\nthe Gorgon, while Margaret, lightly humming an air, picked up a weekly\r\npaper and became absorbed in it.\r\n\r\n'Margaret, let me explain,' panted Archibald. Mrs Milsom was understood\r\nto remark that she dared say. Margaret's attention was riveted by a\r\nfashion plate.\r\n\r\n'Driving in a taximeter to the ferry this morning,' resumed Archibald,\r\n'I had an accident.'\r\n\r\nThis was the result of some rather feverish brain-work on the way from\r\nthe links to the cottage.\r\n\r\nThe periodical flopped to the floor.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Archie, are you hurt?'\r\n\r\n'A few scratches, nothing more; but it made me miss my train.'\r\n\r\n'What train did you catch?' asked Mrs Milsom sepulchrally.\r\n\r\n'The one o'clock. I came straight on here from the station.'\r\n\r\n'Why,' said Margaret, 'Stuyvesant was coming home on the one o'clock\r\ntrain. Did you see him?'\r\n\r\nArchibald's jaw dropped slightly.\r\n\r\n'Er--no,' he said.\r\n\r\n'How curious,' said Margaret.\r\n\r\n'Very curious,' said Archibald.\r\n\r\n'Most curious,' said Mrs Milsom.\r\n\r\nThey were still reflecting on the singularity of this fact when the\r\ndoor opened, and the son of the house entered in person.\r\n\r\n'Thought I should find you here, Mealing,' he said. 'They gave me this\r\nat the station to give to you; you dropped it this morning when you got\r\nout of the train.'\r\n\r\nHe handed Archibald the missing pouch.\r\n\r\n'Thanks,' said the latter huskily. 'When you say this morning, of course\r\nyou mean this afternoon, but thanks all the same--thanks--thanks.'\r\n\r\n'No, Archibald Mealing, he does _not_ mean this afternoon,' said\r\nMrs Milsom. 'Stuyvesant, speak! From what train did that guf--did Mr\r\nMealing alight when he dropped the tobacco-pouch?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'The ten o'clock, the fellow told me. Said he would have given it back\r\nto him then only he sprinted off in the deuce of a hurry.'\r\n\r\nSix eyes focused themselves upon Archibald.\r\n\r\n'Margaret,' he said, 'I will not try to deceive you--'\r\n\r\n'You may try,' observed Mrs Milsom, 'but you will not succeed.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Archibald?'\r\n\r\nArchibald fingered his collar.\r\n\r\n'There was no taximeter accident.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Mrs Milsom.\r\n\r\n'The fact is, I have been playing in a golf tournament.'\r\n\r\nMargaret uttered an exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n'Playing golf!'\r\n\r\nArchibald bowed his head with manly resignation.\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you arrange for us to meet on the\r\nlinks? I should have loved it.'\r\n\r\nArchibald was amazed.\r\n\r\n'You take an interest in golf, Margaret? You! I thought you scorned it,\r\nconsidered it an unintellectual game. I thought you considered all\r\ngames unintellectual.'\r\n\r\n'Why, I play golf myself. Not very well.'\r\n\r\n'Margaret! Why didn't you tell me?'\r\n\r\n'I thought you might not like it. You were so spiritual, so poetic. I\r\nfeared you would despise me.'\r\n\r\nArchibald took a step forward. His voice was tense and trembling.\r\n\r\n'Margaret,' he said, 'this is no time for misunderstandings. We must be\r\nopen with one another. Our happiness is at stake. Tell me honestly, do\r\nyou like poetry really?'\r\n\r\nMargaret hesitated, then answered bravely:\r\n\r\n'No, Archibald,' she said, 'it is as you suspect. I am not worthy of\r\nyou. I do _not_ like poetry. Ah, you shudder! You turn away! Your\r\nface grows hard and scornful!'\r\n\r\n'I don't!' yelled Archibald. 'It doesn't! It doesn't do anything of\r\nthe sort! You've made me another man!'\r\n\r\nShe stared, wild-eyed, astonished.\r\n\r\n'What! Do you mean that you, too--'\r\n\r\n'I should just say I do. I tell you I hate the beastly stuff. I only\r\npretended to like it because I thought you did. The hours I've spent\r\nlearning it up! I wonder I've not got brain fever.'\r\n\r\n'Archie! Used you to read it up, too? Oh, if I'd only known!'\r\n\r\n'And you forgive me--this morning, I mean?'\r\n\r\n'Of course. You couldn't leave a golf tournament. By the way, how did\r\nyou get on?'\r\n\r\nArchibald coughed.\r\n\r\n'Rather well,' he said modestly. 'Pretty decently. In fact, not badly.\r\nAs a matter of fact, I won the championship.'\r\n\r\n'The championship!' whispered Margaret. 'Of America?'\r\n\r\n'Well, not _absolutely_ of America,' said Archibald. 'But all the\r\nsame, a championship.'\r\n\r\n'My hero.'\r\n\r\n'You won't be wanting me for a while, I guess?' said Stuyvesant\r\nnonchalantly. 'Think I'll smoke a cigarette on the porch.'\r\n\r\nAnd sobs from the stairs told that Mrs Milsom was already on her way to\r\nher room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN, THE MAID, AND THE MIASMA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this story is concerned principally with the Man and the Maid,\r\nthe Miasma pervades it to such an extent that I feel justified in\r\nputting his name on the bills. Webster's Dictionary gives the meaning\r\nof the word 'miasma' as 'an infection floating in the air; a deadly\r\nexhalation'; and, in the opinion of Mr Robert Ferguson, his late\r\nemployer, that description, though perhaps a little too flattering, on\r\nthe whole summed up Master Roland Bean pretty satisfactorily. Until the\r\nprevious day he had served Mr Ferguson in the capacity of office-boy;\r\nbut there was that about Master Bean which made it practically\r\nimpossible for anyone to employ him for long. A syndicate of Galahad,\r\nParsifal, and Marcus Aurelius might have done it, but to an ordinary\r\nerring man, conscious of things done which should not have been done,\r\nand other things equally numerous left undone, he was too oppressive.\r\nOne conscience is enough for any man. The employer of Master Bean had\r\nto cringe before two. Nobody can last long against an office-boy whose\r\neyes shine with quiet, respectful reproof through gold-rimmed\r\nspectacles, whose manner is that of a middle-aged saint, and who\r\nobviously knows all the Plod and Punctuality books by heart and orders\r\nhis life by their precepts. Master Bean was a walking edition of\r\n_Stepping-Stones to Success, Millionaires who Have Never Smoked_,\r\nand _Young Man, Get up Early_. Galahad, Parsifal, and Marcus\r\nAurelius, as I say, might have remained tranquil in his presence, but\r\nRobert Ferguson found the contract too large. After one month he had\r\nbraced himself up and sacked the Punctual Plodder.\r\n\r\nYet now he was sitting in his office, long after the last clerk had\r\nleft, long after the hour at which he himself was wont to leave, his\r\nmind full of his late employee.\r\n\r\nWas this remorse? Was he longing for the touch of the vanished hand,\r\nthe gleam of the departed spectacles? He was not. His mind was full of\r\nMaster Bean because Master Bean was waiting for him in the outer\r\noffice; and he lingered on at his desk, after the day's work was done,\r\nfor the same reason. Word had been brought to him earlier in the\r\nevening, that Master Roland Bean would like to see him. The answer to\r\nthat was easy: 'Tell him I'm busy.' Master Bean's admirably dignified\r\nreply was that he understood how great was the pressure of Mr\r\nFerguson's work, and that he would wait till he was at liberty.\r\nLiberty! Talk of the liberty of the treed possum, but do not use the\r\nword in connexion with a man bottled up in an office, with Roland Bean\r\nguarding the only exit.\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson kicked the waste-paper basket savagely. The unfairness of\r\nthe thing hurt him. A sacked office-boy ought to stay sacked. He had no\r\nbusiness to come popping up again like Banquo's ghost. It was not\r\nplaying the game.\r\n\r\nThe reader may wonder what was the trouble--why Mr Ferguson could not\r\nstalk out and brusquely dispose of his foe; but then the reader has not\r\nemployed Master Bean for a month. Mr Ferguson had, and his nerve had\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nA slight cough penetrated the door between the two offices. Mr Ferguson\r\nrose and grabbed his hat. Perhaps a sudden rush--he shot out with the\r\ntense concentration of one moving towards the refreshment-room at a\r\nstation where the train stops three minutes.\r\n\r\n'Good evening, sir!' was the watcher's view-hallo.\r\n\r\n'Ah, Bean,' said Mr Ferguson, flitting rapidly, 'you still here? I\r\nthought you had gone. I'm afraid I cannot stop now. Some other time--'\r\n\r\nHe was almost through.\r\n\r\n'I fear, sir, that you will be unable to get out,' said Master Bean,\r\nsympathetically. 'The building is locked up.'\r\n\r\nMen who have been hit by bullets say the first sensation is merely a\r\nsort of dull shock. So it was with Mr Ferguson. He stopped in his\r\ntracks and stared.\r\n\r\n'The porter closes the door at seven o'clock punctually, sir. It is now\r\nnearly twenty minutes after the hour.'\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson's brain was still in the numbed stage.\r\n\r\n'Closes the door?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Then how are we to get out?'\r\n\r\n'I fear we cannot get out, sir.'\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson digested this.\r\n\r\n'I am no longer in your employment, sir,' said Master Bean,\r\nrespectfully, 'but I hope that in the circumstances you will permit me\r\nto remain here during the night.'\r\n\r\n'During the night!'\r\n\r\n'It would enable me to sleep more comfortably than on the stairs.'\r\n\r\n'But we can't stop here all night,' said Mr Ferguson, feebly.\r\n\r\nHe had anticipated an unpleasant five minutes in Master Bean's company.\r\nImagination boggled at the thought of an unpleasant thirteen hours.\r\n\r\nHe collapsed into a chair.\r\n\r\n'I called,' said Master Bean, shelving the trivial subject of the\r\nprospective vigil, 'in the hope that I might persuade you, sir, to\r\nreconsider your decision in regard to my dismissal. I can assure you,\r\nsir, that I am extremely anxious to give satisfaction. If you would\r\ntake me back and inform me how I have fallen short, I would endeavour\r\nto improve, I--'\r\n\r\n'We can't stop here all night,' interrupted Mr Ferguson, bounding from\r\nhis chair and beginning to pace the floor.\r\n\r\n'Without presumption, sir, I feel that if you were to give me another\r\nchance I should work to your satisfaction. I should endeavour--'\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson stared at him in dumb horror. He had a momentary vision of\r\na sleepless night spent in listening to a nicely-polished speech for\r\nthe defence. He was seized with a mad desire for flight. He could not\r\nleave the building, but he must get away somewhere and think.\r\n\r\nHe dashed from the room and raced up the dark stairs. And as he arrived\r\nat the next floor his eye was caught by a thin pencil of light which\r\nproceeded from a door on the left.\r\n\r\nNo shipwrecked mariner on a desert island could have welcomed the\r\nappearance of a sail with greater enthusiasm. He bounded at the door.\r\nHe knew to whom the room belonged. It was the office of one Blaythwayt;\r\nand Blaythwayt was not only an acquaintance, but a sportsman. Quite\r\npossibly there might be a pack of cards on Blaythwayt's person to help\r\npass the long hours. And if not, at least he would be company and his\r\noffice a refuge. He flung open the door without going through the\r\nformality of knocking. Etiquette is not for the marooned.\r\n\r\n'I say, Blaythwayt--' he began, and stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe only occupant of the room was a girl.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon,' he said, 'I thought--'\r\n\r\nHe stopped again. His eyes, dazzled with the light, had not seen\r\nclearly. They did so now.\r\n\r\n'You!' he cried.\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him, first with surprise, then with a cool\r\nhostility. There was a long pause. Eighteen months had passed since\r\nthey had parted, and conversation does not flow easily after eighteen\r\nmonths of silence, especially if the nature of the parting has been\r\nbitter and stormy.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing here?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I thought my doings had ceased to interest you,' she said. 'I am Mr\r\nBlaythwayt's secretary, I have been here a fortnight. I have wondered\r\nif we should meet. I used to see you sometimes in the street.'\r\n\r\n'I never saw you.'\r\n\r\n'No?' she said indifferently.\r\n\r\nHe ran his hand through his hair in a dazed way.\r\n\r\n'Do you know we are locked in?' he said.\r\n\r\nHe had expected wild surprise and dismay. She merely clicked her tongue\r\nin an annoyed manner.\r\n\r\n'Again!' she said. 'What a nuisance! I was locked in only a week ago.'\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with unwilling respect, the respect of the novice for\r\nthe veteran. She was nothing to him now, of course. She had passed out\r\nof his life. But he could not help remembering that long ago--eighteen\r\nmonths ago--what he had admired most in her had been this same spirit,\r\nthis game refusal to be disturbed by Fate's blows. It braced him up.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and looked curiously at her.\r\n\r\n'So you left the stage?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I thought we agreed when we parted not to speak to one another,' said\r\nshe, coldly.\r\n\r\n'Did we? I thought it was only to meet as strangers.'\r\n\r\n'It's the same thing.'\r\n\r\n'Is it? I often talk to strangers.'\r\n\r\n'What a bore they must think you!' she said, hiding one-eighth of a\r\nyawn with the tips of two fingers. 'I suppose,' she went on, with faint\r\ninterest, 'you talk to them in trains when they are trying to read\r\ntheir paper?'\r\n\r\n'I don't force my conversation on anyone.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you?' she said, raising her eyebrows in sweet surprise. 'Only\r\nyour company--is that it?'\r\n\r\n'Are you alluding to the present occasion?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you have an office of your own in this building, I believe.'\r\n\r\n'I have.'\r\n\r\n'Then why--'\r\n\r\n'I am at perfect liberty,' he said, with dignity, 'to sit in my friend\r\nBlaythwayt's office if I choose. I wish to see Mr Blaythwayt.'\r\n\r\n'On business?'\r\n\r\nHe proved that she had established no corner in raised eyebrows.\r\n\r\n'I fear,' he said, 'that I cannot discuss my affairs with Mr\r\nBlaythwayt's employees. I must see him personally.'\r\n\r\n'Mr Blaythwayt is not here.'\r\n\r\n'I will wait.'\r\n\r\n'He will not be here for thirteen hours.'\r\n\r\nI'll wait.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' she burst out; 'you have brought it on yourself. You've\r\nonly yourself to blame. If you had been good and had gone back to your\r\noffice, I would have brought you down some cake and cocoa.'\r\n\r\n'Cake and cocoa!' said he, superciliously.\r\n\r\n'Yes, cake and cocoa,' she snapped. 'It's all very well for you to turn\r\nup your nose at them now, but wait. You've thirteen hours of this in\r\nfront of you. I know what it is. Last time I had to spend the night\r\nhere I couldn't get to sleep for hours, and when I did I dreamed that I\r\nwas chasing chocolate _eclairs_ round and round Trafalgar Square.\r\nAnd I never caught them either. Long before the night was finished I\r\nwould have given _anything_ for even a dry biscuit. I made up my\r\nmind I'd always keep something here in case I ever got locked in\r\nagain--yes, smile. You'd better while you can.'\r\n\r\nHe was smiling, but wanly. Nobody but a professional fasting man could\r\nhave looked unmoved into the Inferno she had pictured. Then he rallied.\r\n\r\n'Cake!' he said, scornfully.\r\n\r\nShe nodded grimly.\r\n\r\n'Cocoa!'\r\n\r\nAgain that nod, ineffably sinister.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid I don't care for either,' he said.\r\n\r\n'If you will excuse me,' she said, indifferently, 'I have a little work\r\nthat I must finish.'\r\n\r\nShe turned to her desk, leaving him to his thoughts. They were not\r\nexhilarating. He had maintained a brave front, but inwardly he quailed.\r\nReared in the country, he had developed at an early age a fine, healthy\r\nappetite. Once, soon after his arrival in London, he had allowed a\r\ndangerous fanatic to persuade him that the secret of health was to go\r\nwithout breakfast.\r\n\r\nHis lunch that day had cost him eight shillings, and only decent shame\r\nhad kept the figure as low as that. He knew perfectly well that long\r\nere the dawn of day his whole soul would be crying out for cake,\r\nsquealing frantically for cocoa. Would it not be better to--no, a\r\nthousand times no! Death, but not surrender. His self-respect was at\r\nstake. Looking back, he saw that his entire relations with this girl\r\nhad been a series of battles of will. So far, though he had certainly\r\nnot won, he had not been defeated. He must not be defeated now.\r\n\r\nHe crossed his legs and sang a gay air under his breath.\r\n\r\n'If you wouldn't mind,' said the girl, looking up.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon?'\r\n\r\n'Your groaning interrupts my work.'\r\n\r\n'I was not groaning. I was singing.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I'm sorry!'\r\n\r\n'Not at all.'\r\n\r\nEight bars rest.\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson, deprived of the solace of song, filled in the time by\r\ngazing at the toiler's back-hair. It set in motion a train of\r\nthought--an express train bound for the Land of Yesterday. It recalled\r\ndays in the woods, evenings on the lawn. It recalled sunshine--storm.\r\nPlenty of storm. Minor tempests that burst from a clear sky, apparently\r\nwithout cause, and the great final tornado. There had been cause enough\r\nfor that. Why was it, mused Mr Ferguson, that every girl in every\r\ncountry town in every county of England who had ever recited 'Curfew\r\nshall not ring tonight' well enough to escape lynching at the hands of\r\na rustic audience was seized with the desire to come to London and go\r\non the stage?\r\n\r\nHe sighed.\r\n\r\n'Please don't snort,' said a cold voice, from behind the back-hair.\r\n\r\nThere was a train-wreck in the Land of Yesterday. Mr Ferguson, the\r\nonly survivor, limped back into the Present.\r\n\r\nThe Present had little charm, but at least it was better than the\r\ncakeless Future. He fixed his thoughts on it. He wondered how Master\r\nBean was passing the time. Probably doing deep-breathing exercises, or\r\nreading a pocket Aristotle. The girl pushed back her chair and rose.\r\n\r\nShe went to a small cupboard in the corner of the room, and from it\r\nproduced in instalments all that goes to make cake and cocoa. She did\r\nnot speak. Presently, filling Space, there sprang into being an Odour;\r\nand as it reached him Mr Ferguson stiffened in his chair, bracing\r\nhimself as for a fight to the death. It was more than an odour. It was\r\nthe soul of the cocoa singing to him. His fingers gripped the arms of\r\nthe chair. This was the test.\r\n\r\nThe girl separated a section of cake from the parent body. She caught\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\n'You had better go,' she said. 'If you go now it's just possible that I\r\nmay--but I forgot, you don't like cocoa.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said he, resolutely, 'I don't.'\r\n\r\nShe seemed now in the mood for conversation.\r\n\r\n'I wonder why you came up here at all,' she said.\r\n\r\n'There's no reason why you shouldn't know. I came up here because my\r\nlate office-boy is downstairs.'\r\n\r\n'Why should that send you up?'\r\n\r\n'You've never met him or you wouldn't ask. Have you ever had to face\r\nsomeone who is simply incarnate Saintliness and Disapproval, who--'\r\n\r\n'Are you forgetting that I was engaged to you for several weeks?'\r\n\r\nHe was too startled to be hurt. The idea of himself as a Roland Bean\r\nwas too new to be assimilated immediately. It called for meditation.\r\n\r\n'Was I like that?' he said at last, almost humbly.\r\n\r\n'You know you were. Oh, I'm not thinking only about your views on the\r\nstage! It was everything. Whatever I did you were there to disapprove\r\nlike a--like a--like an aunt,' she concluded triumphantly. 'You were\r\ntoo good for anything. If only you would, just once, have done\r\nsomething wrong. I think I'd have--But you couldn't. You're simply\r\nperfect.'\r\n\r\nA man will remain cool and composed under many charges. Hint that his\r\ntastes are criminal, and he will shrug his shoulders. But accuse him\r\nof goodness, and you rouse the lion.\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson's brow darkened.\r\n\r\n'As a matter of fact,' he said, haughtily, 'I was to have had supper\r\nwith a chorus-girl this very night.'\r\n\r\n'How very appalling!' said she, languidly.\r\n\r\nShe sipped her cocoa.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you consider that very terrible?' she said.\r\n\r\n'For a beginner.'\r\n\r\nShe crumbled her cake. Suddenly she looked up.\r\n\r\n'Who is she?' she demanded, fiercely.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon?' he said, coming out of a pleasant reverie.\r\n\r\n'Who is this girl?'\r\n\r\n'She--er--her name--her name is Marie--Marie Templeton.'\r\n\r\nShe seemed to think for a moment.\r\n\r\n'That dear old lady?' she said.' I know her quite well.'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'\"Mother\" we used to call her. Have you met her son?'\r\n\r\n'Her son?'\r\n\r\n'A rather nice-looking man. He plays heavy parts on tour. He's married\r\nand has two of the sweetest children. Their grandmother is devoted to\r\nthem. Hasn't she ever mentioned them to you?'\r\n\r\nShe poured herself out another cup of cocoa. Conversation again\r\nlanguished.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you're very fond of her?' she said at length.\r\n\r\n'I'm devoted to her.' He paused. 'Dear little thing!' he added.\r\n\r\nShe rose and moved to the door. There was a nasty gleam in her eyes.\r\n\r\n'You aren't going?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I shall be back in a moment. I'm just going to bring your poor little\r\noffice-boy up here. He must be missing you.'\r\n\r\nHe sprang up, but she had gone. Leaning over the banisters, he heard a\r\ndoor open below, then a short conversation, and finally footsteps\r\nclimbing the stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch dark on the landing. He stepped aside, and they passed\r\nwithout seeing him. Master Bean was discoursing easily on cocoa, the\r\nprocesses whereby it was manufactured, and the remarkable distances\r\nwhich natives of Mexico had covered with it as their only food. The\r\ndoor opened, flooding the landing with light, and Mr Ferguson, stepping\r\nfrom ambush, began to descend the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe girl came to the banisters.\r\n\r\n'Mr Ferguson!'\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n'Did you want me?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Are you going back to your office?'\r\n\r\n'I am. I hope you will enjoy Bean's society. He has a fund of useful\r\ninformation on all subjects.'\r\n\r\nHe went on. After a while she returned to the room and closed the door.\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson went into his office and sat down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was once a person of the name of Simeon Stylites, who took up a\r\nposition on top of a pillar and stayed there, having no other\r\nengagements, for thirty years. Mr Ferguson, who had read Tennyson's\r\npoem on the subject, had until tonight looked upon this as a pretty\r\ngood thing. Reading the lines:\r\n\r\n                  ...thrice ten years,\r\nThrice multiplied by superhuman pangs,\r\nIn hunger and in thirsts, fevers and colds,\r\nIn coughs, aches, stitches, ulcerous throes, and cramps,...\r\nPatient on this tall pillar I have borne.\r\nRain, wind, frost, heat, hail, damp, and sleet, and snow,\r\n\r\nhe had gathered roughly, as it were, that Simeon had not been\r\ncomfortable. He had pitied him. But now, sitting in his office-chair,\r\nhe began to wonder what the man had made such a fuss about. He\r\nsuspected him of having had a touch of the white feather in him. It was\r\nnot as if he had not had food. He talked about 'hungers and thirsts',\r\nbut he must have had something to eat, or he could not have stayed the\r\ncourse. Very likely, if the truth were known, there was somebody below\r\nwho passed him up regular supplies of cake and cocoa.\r\n\r\nHe began to look on Simeon as an overrated amateur.\r\n\r\nSleep refused to come to him. It got as far as his feet, but no\r\nfarther. He rose and stamped to restore the circulation.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that he definitely condemned Simeon Stylites as a\r\nsybaritic fraud.\r\n\r\nIf this were one of those realistic Zolaesque stories I would describe\r\nthe crick in the back that--but let us hurry on.\r\n\r\nIt was about six hours later--he had no watch, but the numbers of\r\naches, stitches, not to mention cramps, that he had experienced could\r\nnot possibly have been condensed into a shorter period--that his manly\r\nspirit snapped. Let us not judge him too harshly. The girl upstairs had\r\nbroken his heart, ruined his life, and practically compared him to\r\nRoland Bean, and his pride should have built up an impassable wall\r\nbetween them, but--she had cake and cocoa. In similar circumstances\r\nKing Arthur would have grovelled before Guinevere.\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the door and tore it open. There was a startled\r\nexclamation from the darkness outside.\r\n\r\n'I hope I didn't disturb you,' said a meek voice.\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson did not answer. His twitching nostrils were drinking in a\r\nfamiliar aroma.\r\n\r\n'Were you asleep? May I come in? I've brought you some cake and cocoa.'\r\n\r\nHe took the rich gifts from her in silence. There are moments in a\r\nman's life too sacred for words. The wonder of the thing had struck him\r\ndumb. An instant before and he had had but a desperate hope of winning\r\nthese priceless things from her at the cost of all his dignity and\r\nself-respect. He had been prepared to secure them through a shower of\r\nbiting taunts, a blizzard of razor-like 'I told you so's'. Yet here he\r\nwas, draining the cup, and still able to hold his head up, look the\r\nworld in the face, and call himself a man.\r\n\r\nHis keen eye detected a crumb on his coat-sleeve. This retrieved and\r\nconsumed, he turned to her, seeking explanation.\r\n\r\nShe was changed. The battle-gleam had faded from her eyes. She seemed\r\nscared and subdued. Her manner was of one craving comfort and\r\nprotection. 'That awful boy!' she breathed.\r\n\r\n'Bean?' said Mr Ferguson, picking a crumb off the carpet.\r\n\r\n'He's frightful.'\r\n\r\n'I thought you might get a little tired of him! What has he been\r\ndoing?'\r\n\r\n'Talking. I feel battered. He's like one of those awful encyclopedias\r\nthat give you a sort of dull leaden feeling in your head directly you\r\nopen them. Do you know how many tons of water go over Niagara Falls\r\nevery year?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'He does.'\r\n\r\n'I told you he had a fund of useful information. The Purpose and\r\nTenacity books insist on it. That's how you Catch your Employer's Eye.\r\nOne morning the boss suddenly wants to know how many horsehair sofas\r\nthere are in Brixton, the number of pins that would reach from London\r\nBridge to Waterloo. You tell him, and he takes you into partnership.\r\nLater you become a millionaire. But I haven't thanked you for the\r\ncocoa. It was fine.'\r\n\r\nHe waited for the retort, but it did not come. A pleased wonderment\r\nfilled him. Could these things really be thus?\r\n\r\n'And it isn't only what he says,' she went on. 'I know what you mean\r\nabout him now. It's his accusing manner.'\r\n\r\n'I've tried to analyse that manner. I believe it's the spectacles.'\r\n\r\n'It's frightful when he looks at you; you think of all the wrong things\r\nyou have ever done or ever wanted to do.'\r\n\r\n'Does he have that effect on you?' he said, excitedly. 'Why, that\r\nexactly describes what I feel.'\r\n\r\nThe affinities looked at one another.\r\n\r\nShe was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n'We always did think alike on most things, didn't we?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Of course we did.'\r\n\r\nHe shifted his chair forward.\r\n\r\n'It was all my fault,' he said. 'I mean, what happened.'\r\n\r\n'It wasn't. It--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it was. I want to tell you something. I don't know if it will\r\nmake any difference now, but I should like you to know it. It's this.\r\nI've altered a good deal since I came to London. For the better, I\r\nthink. I'm a pretty poor sort of specimen still, but at least I don't\r\nimagine I can measure life with a foot-rule. I don't judge the world\r\nany longer by the standards of a country town. London has knocked some\r\nof the corners off me. I don't think you would find me the Bean type\r\nany longer. I don't disapprove of other people much now. Not as a\r\nhabit. I find I have enough to do keeping myself up to the mark.'\r\n\r\n'I want to tell you something, too,' she said. 'I expect it's too late,\r\nbut never mind. I want you to hear it. I've altered, too, since I came\r\nto London. I used to think the Universe had been invented just to look\r\non and wave its hat while I did great things. London has put a large\r\npiece of cold ice against my head, and the swelling has gone down. I'm\r\nnot the girl with ambitions any longer. I just want to keep employed,\r\nand not have too bad a time when the day's work is over.'\r\n\r\nHe came across to where she sat.\r\n\r\n'We said we would meet as strangers, and we do. We never have known\r\neach other. Don't you think we had better get acquainted?' he said.\r\n\r\nThere was a respectful tap at the door.\r\n\r\n'Come in?' snapped Mr Ferguson. 'Well?' Behind the gold-rimmed\r\nspectacles of Master Bean there shone a softer look than usual, a look\r\nrather complacent than disapproving.\r\n\r\n'I must apologize, sir, for intruding upon you. I am no longer in your\r\nemployment, but I do hope that in the circumstances you will forgive\r\nmy entering your private office. Thinking over our situation just now\r\nan idea came to me by means of which I fancy we might be enabled to\r\nleave the building.'\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n'It occurred to me, sir, that by telephoning to the nearest\r\npolice-station--'\r\n\r\n'Good heavens!' cried Mr Ferguson.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later he replaced the receiver.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' he said. 'I've made them understand the trouble.\r\nThey're bringing a ladder. I wonder what the time is? It must be about\r\nfour in the morning.'\r\n\r\nMaster Bean produced a Waterbury watch.\r\n\r\n'The time, sir, is almost exactly half past ten.'\r\n\r\n'Half past ten! We must have been here longer than three hours. Your\r\nwatch is wrong.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir, I am very careful to keep it exactly right. I do not wish to\r\nrun any risk of being unpunctual.'\r\n\r\n'Half past ten!' cried Mr Ferguson. 'Why, we're in heaps of time to\r\nlook in at the Savoy for supper. This is great. I'll phone them to keep\r\na table.'\r\n\r\n'Supper! I thought--'\r\n\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n'What's that? Thought what?'\r\n\r\n'Hadn't you an engagement for supper?'\r\n\r\nHe stared at her.\r\n\r\n'Whatever gave you that idea? Of course not.'\r\n\r\n'I thought you said you were taking Miss Templeton--'\r\n\r\n'Miss Temp--Oh!' His face cleared. 'Oh, there isn't such a person. I\r\ninvented her. I had to when you accused me of being like our friend the\r\nMiasma. Legitimate self-defence.'\r\n\r\n'I do not wish to interrupt you, sir, when you are busy,' said Master\r\nBean, 'but--'\r\n\r\n'Come and see me tomorrow morning,' said Mr Ferguson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Bob,' said the girl, as the first threatening mutters from the\r\norchestra heralded an imminent storm of melody, 'when that boy comes\r\ntomorrow, what are going to do?'\r\n\r\n'Call up the police.'\r\n\r\n'No, but you must do something. We shouldn't have been here if it\r\nhadn't been for him.'\r\n\r\n'That's true!' He pondered. 'I've got it; I'll get him a job with\r\nRaikes and Courtenay.'\r\n\r\n'Why Raikes and Courtenay?'\r\n\r\n'Because I have a pull with them. But principally,' said Mr Ferguson,\r\nwith a devilish grin, 'because they live in Edinburgh, which, as you\r\nare doubtless aware, is a long, long way from London.'\r\n\r\nHe bent across the table.\r\n\r\n'Isn't this like old times?' he said. 'Do you remember the first time I\r\never ki--'\r\n\r\nJust then the orchestra broke out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD ANGEL\r\n\r\n\r\nAny man under thirty years of age who tells you he is not afraid of an\r\nEnglish butler lies. He may not show his fear. Outwardly he may be\r\nbrave--aggressive even, perhaps to the extent of calling the great man\r\n'Here!' or 'Hi!' But, in his heart, when he meets that, cold, blue,\r\nintrospective eye, he quakes.\r\n\r\nThe effect that Keggs, the butler at the Keiths', had on Martin\r\nRossiter was to make him feel as if he had been caught laughing in a\r\ncathedral. He fought against the feeling. He asked himself who Keggs\r\nwas, anyway; and replied defiantly that Keggs was a Menial--and an\r\noverfed Menial. But all the while he knew that logic was useless.\r\n\r\nWhen the Keiths had invited him to their country home he had been\r\ndelighted. They were among his oldest friends. He liked Mr Keith. He\r\nliked Mrs Keith. He loved Elsa Keith, and had done so from boyhood.\r\n\r\nBut things had gone wrong. As he leaned out of his bedroom window at\r\nthe end of the first week, preparatory to dressing for dinner, he was\r\nmore than half inclined to make some excuse and get right out of the\r\nplace next day. The bland dignity of Keggs had taken all the heart out\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nNor was it Keggs alone who had driven his thoughts towards flight.\r\nKeggs was merely a passive evil, like toothache or a rainy day. What\r\nhad begun actively to make the place impossible was a perfectly\r\npestilential young man of the name of Barstowe.\r\n\r\nThe house-party at the Keiths had originally been, from Martin's\r\nview-point, almost ideal. The rest of the men were of the speechless,\r\nmoustache-tugging breed. They had come to shoot, and they shot. When\r\nthey were not shooting they congregated in the billiard-room and\r\ndevoted their powerful intellects exclusively to snooker-pool, leaving\r\nMartin free to talk undisturbed to Elsa. He had been doing this for\r\nfive days with great contentment when Aubrey Barstowe arrived. Mrs\r\nKeith had developed of late leanings towards culture. In her town house\r\na charge of small-shot, fired in any direction on a Thursday\r\nafternoon, could not have failed to bring down a poet, a novelist, or a\r\npainter. Aubrey Barstowe, author of _The Soul's Eclipse_ and other\r\npoems, was a constant member of the crowd. A youth of insinuating\r\nmanners, he had appealed to Mrs Keith from the start; and unfortunately\r\nthe virus had extended to Elsa. Many a pleasant, sunshiny Thursday\r\nafternoon had been poisoned for Martin by the sight of Aubrey and Elsa\r\ntogether on a distant settee, matching temperaments. The rest is too\r\npainful. It was a rout. The poet did not shoot, so that when Martin\r\nreturned of an evening his rival was about five hours of soul-to-soul\r\ntalk up and only two to play. And those two, the after-dinner hours,\r\nwhich had once been the hours for which Martin had lived, were pure\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was he with his thoughts that the first intimation he had\r\nthat he was not alone in the room was a genteel cough. Behind him,\r\nholding a small can, was Keggs.\r\n\r\n'Your 'ot water, sir,' said the butler, austerely but not unkindly.\r\n\r\nKeggs was a man--one must use that word, though it seems grossly\r\ninadequate--of medium height, pigeon-toed at the base, bulgy half-way\r\nup, and bald at the apex. His manner was restrained and dignified, his\r\nvoice soft and grave.\r\n\r\nBut it was his eye that quelled Martin. That cold, blue,\r\ndukes-have-treated-me-as-an-elder-brother eye.\r\n\r\nHe fixed it upon him now, as he added, placing the can on the floor.\r\n'It is Frederick's duty, but tonight I hundertook it.'\r\n\r\nMartin had no answer. He was dazed. Keggs had spoken with the proud\r\nhumility of an emperor compelled by misfortune to shine shoes.\r\n\r\n'Might I have a word with you, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Ye-e-ss, yes,' stammered Martin. 'Won't you take a--I mean, yes,\r\ncertainly.'\r\n\r\n'It is perhaps a liberty,' began Keggs. He paused, and raked Martin\r\nwith the eye that had rested on dining dukes.\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' said Martin, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n'I should like,' went on Keggs, bowing, 'to speak to you on a somewhat\r\nintimate subject--Miss Elsa.'\r\n\r\nMartin's eyes and mouth opened slowly.\r\n\r\n'You are going the wrong way to work, if you will allow me to say so,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\nMartin's jaw dropped another inch.\r\n\r\n'Wha-a--'\r\n\r\n'Women, sir,' proceeded Keggs, 'young ladies--are peculiar. I have had,\r\nif I may say so, certain hopportunities of observing their ways. Miss\r\nElsa reminds me in some respects of Lady Angelica Fendall, whom I had\r\nthe honour of knowing when I was butler to her father, Lord Stockleigh.\r\nHer ladyship was hinclined to be romantic. She was fond of poetry, like\r\nMiss Elsa. She would sit by the hour, sir, listening to young Mr Knox\r\nreading Tennyson, which was no part of his duties, he being employed by\r\nhis lordship to teach Lord Bertie Latin and Greek and what not. You may\r\nhave noticed, sir, that young ladies is often took by Tennyson,\r\nhespecially in the summertime. Mr Barstowe was reading Tennyson to Miss\r\nElsa in the 'all when I passed through just now. _The Princess_,\r\nif I am not mistaken.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know what the thing was,' groaned Martin. 'She seemed to be\r\nenjoying it.'\r\n\r\n'Lady Angelica was greatly addicted to _The Princess_. Young Mr\r\nKnox was reading portions of that poem to her when his lordship come\r\nupon them. Most rashly his lordship made a public hexpose and packed Mr\r\nKnox off next day. It was not my place to volunteer advice, but I could\r\nhave told him what would happen. Two days later her ladyship slips away\r\nto London early in the morning, and they're married at a\r\nregistry-office. That is why I say that you are going the wrong way to\r\nwork with Miss Elsa, sir. With certain types of 'igh spirited young lady\r\nhopposition is useless. Now, when Mr Barstowe was reading to Miss Elsa\r\non the occasion to which I 'ave alluded, you were sitting by, trying to\r\nengage her attention. It's not the way, sir. You should leave them\r\nalone together. Let her see so much of him, and nobody else but him,\r\nthat she will grow tired of him. Fondness for poetry, sir, is very much\r\nlike the whisky 'abit. You can't cure a man what has got that by\r\nhopposition. Now, if you will permit me to offer a word of advice, sir,\r\nI say, let Miss Elsa 'ave all the poetry she wants.'\r\n\r\nMartin was conscious of one coherent feeling at the conclusion of this\r\naddress, and that was one of amazed gratitude. A lesser man who had\r\nentered his room and begun to discuss his private affairs would have\r\nhad reason to retire with some speed; but that Keggs should descend\r\nfrom his pedestal and interest himself in such lowly matters was a\r\ndifferent thing altogether.\r\n\r\n'I'm very much obliged--' he was stammering, when the butler raised a\r\ndeprecatory hand.\r\n\r\n'My interest in the matter,' he said, smoothly, 'is not entirely\r\nhaltruistic. For some years back, in fact, since Miss Elsa came out, we\r\nhave had a matrimonial sweepstake in the servants' hall at each\r\nhouse-party. The names of the gentlemen in the party are placed in a hat\r\nand drawn in due course. Should Miss Elsa become engaged to any member\r\nof the party, the pool goes to the drawer of his name. Should no\r\nengagement occur, the money remains in my charge until the following\r\nyear, when it is added to the new pool. Hitherto I have 'ad the\r\nmisfortune to draw nothing but married gentlemen, but on this occasion\r\nI have secured you, sir. And I may tell you, sir,' he added, with\r\nstately courtesy, 'that, in the opinion of the servants' hall, your\r\nchances are 'ighly fancied,--very 'ighly. The pool has now reached\r\nconsiderable proportions, and, 'aving had certain losses on the Turf\r\nvery recent, I am extremely anxious to win it. So I thought, if I might\r\ntake the liberty, sir, I would place my knowledge of the sex at your\r\ndisposal. You will find it sound in every respect. That is all. Thank\r\nyou, sir.'\r\n\r\nMartin's feelings had undergone a complete revulsion. In the last few\r\nminutes the butler had shed his wings and grown horns, cloven feet, and\r\na forked tail. His rage deprived him of words. He could only gurgle.\r\n\r\n'Don't thank me, sir,' said the butler, indulgently. 'I ask no thanks.\r\nWe are working together for a common hobject, and any little 'elp I can\r\nprovide is given freely.'\r\n\r\n'You old scoundrel!' shouted Martin, his wrath prevailing even against\r\nthat blue eye. 'You have the insolence to come to me and--'\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The thought of these hounds, these demons, coolly gossiping\r\nand speculating below stairs about Elsa, making her the subject of\r\nlittle sporting flutters to relieve the monotony of country life,\r\nchoked him.\r\n\r\n'I shall tell Mr Keith,' he said.\r\n\r\nThe butler shook his bald head gravely.\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't, sir. It is a 'ighly fantastic story, and I don't think he\r\nwould believe it.'\r\n\r\n'Then I'll--Oh, get out!'\r\n\r\nKeggs bowed deferentially.\r\n\r\n'If you wish it, sir,' he said, 'I will withdraw. If I may make the\r\nsuggestion, sir, I think you should commence to dress. Dinner will be\r\nserved in a few minutes. Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\nHe passed softly out of the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was more as a demonstration of defiance against Keggs than because\r\nhe really hoped that anything would come of it that Martin approached\r\nElsa next morning after breakfast. Elsa was strolling on the terrace in\r\nfront of the house with the bard, but Martin broke in on the conference\r\nwith the dogged determination of a steam-drill.\r\n\r\n'Coming out with the guns today, Elsa?' he said.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes. There was an absent look in them.\r\n\r\n'The guns?' she said. 'Oh, no; I hate watching men shoot.'\r\n\r\n'You used to like it.'\r\n\r\n'I used to like dolls,' she said, impatiently.\r\n\r\nMr Barstowe gave tongue. He was a slim, tall, sickeningly beautiful\r\nyoung man, with large, dark eyes, full of expression.\r\n\r\n'We develop,' he said. 'The years go by, and we develop. Our souls\r\nexpand--timidly at first, like little, half-fledged birds stealing out\r\nfrom the--'\r\n\r\n'I don't know that I'm so set on shooting today, myself,' said Martin.\r\n'Will you come round the links?'\r\n\r\n'I am going out in the motor with Mr Barstowe,' said Elsa.\r\n\r\n'The motor!' cried Mr Barstowe. 'Ah, Rossiter, that is the very poetry\r\nof motion. I never ride in a motor-car without those words of\r\nShakespeare's ringing in my mind: \"I'll put a girdle round about the\r\nearth in forty minutes.\"'\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't give way to that sort of thing if I were you,' said\r\nMartin. 'The police are pretty down on road-hogging in these parts.'\r\n\r\n'Mr Barstowe was speaking figuratively,' said Elsa, with disdain.\r\n\r\n'Was he?' grunted Martin, whose sorrows were tending to make him every\r\nday more like a sulky schoolboy. 'I'm afraid I haven't got a poetic\r\nsoul.'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid you haven't,' said Elsa.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence. A bird made itself heard in a neighbouring\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n'\"The moan of doves in immemorial elms,\"' quoted Mr Barstowe, softly.\r\n\r\n'Only it happens to be a crow in a beech,' said Martin, as the bird\r\nflew out.\r\n\r\nElsa's chin tilted itself in scorn. Martin turned on his heel and\r\nwalked away.\r\n\r\n'It's the wrong way, sir; it's the wrong way,' said a voice. 'I was\r\nhobserving you from a window, sir. It's Lady Angelica over again.\r\nHopposition is useless, believe me, sir.'\r\n\r\nMartin faced round, flushed and wrathful. The butler went on unmoved:\r\n'Miss Elsa is going for a ride in the car today, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I know that.'\r\n\r\n'Uncommonly tricky things, these motor-cars. I was saying so to\r\nRoberts, the chauffeur, just as soon as I 'eard Miss Elsa was going out\r\nwith Mr Barstowe. I said, \"Roberts, these cars is tricky; break down\r\nwhen you're twenty miles from hanywhere as soon as look at you.\r\nRoberts,\" I said, slipping him a sovereign, \"'ow awful it would be if\r\nthe car should break down twenty miles from hanywhere today!\"'\r\n\r\nMartin stared.\r\n\r\n'You bribed Roberts to--'\r\n\r\n'Sir! I gave Roberts the sovereign because I am sorry for him. He is a\r\npoor man, and has a wife and family to support.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Martin, sternly; 'I shall go and warn Miss Keith.'\r\n\r\n'Warn her, sir!'\r\n\r\n'I shall tell her that you have bribed Roberts to make the car break\r\ndown so that--'\r\n\r\nKeggs shook his head.\r\n\r\n'I fear she would hardly credit the statement, sir. She might even\r\nthink that you was trying to keep her from going for your own pussonal\r\nends.'\r\n\r\n'I believe you are the devil,' said Martin.\r\n\r\n'I 'ope you will come to look on me, sir,' said Keggs, unctuously, 'as\r\nyour good hangel.'\r\n\r\nMartin shot abominably that day, and, coming home in the evening gloomy\r\nand savage, went straight to his room, and did not reappear till\r\ndinner-time. Elsa had been taken in by one of the moustache-tuggers.\r\nMartin found himself seated on her other side. It was so pleasant to be\r\nnear her, and to feel that the bard was away at the other end of the\r\ntable, that for the moment his spirits revived.\r\n\r\n'Well, how did you like the ride?' he asked, with a smile. 'Did you put\r\nthat girdle round the world?'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him--once. The next moment he had an uninterrupted view\r\nof her shoulder, and heard the sound of her voice as she prattled gaily\r\nto the man on her other side.\r\n\r\nHis heart gave a sudden bound. He understood now. The demon butler had\r\nhad his wicked way. Good heavens! She had thought he was taunting her!\r\nHe must explain at once. He--\r\n\r\n'Hock or sherry, sir?'\r\n\r\nHe looked up into Kegg's expressionless eyes. The butler was wearing\r\nhis on-duty mask. There was no sign of triumph in his face.\r\n\r\n'Oh, sherry. I mean hock. No, sherry. Neither.'\r\n\r\nThis was awful. He must put this right.\r\n\r\n'Elsa,' he said.\r\n\r\nShe was engrossed in her conversation with her neighbour.\r\n\r\nFrom down the table in a sudden lull in the talk came the voice of Mr\r\nBarstowe. He seemed to be in the middle of a narrative.\r\n\r\n'Fortunately,' he was saying, 'I had with me a volume of Shelley, and\r\none of my own little efforts. I had read Miss Keith the whole of the\r\nlatter and much of the former before the chauffeur announced that it\r\nwas once more possible--'\r\n\r\n'Elsa,' said the wretched man, 'I had no idea--you don't think--'\r\n\r\nShe turned to him.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon?' she said, very sweetly.\r\n\r\n'I swear I didn't know--I mean, I'd forgotten--I mean--'\r\n\r\nShe wrinkled her forehead.\r\n\r\n'I'm really afraid I don't understand.'\r\n\r\n'I mean, about the car breaking down.'\r\n\r\n'The car? Oh, yes. Yes, it broke down. We were delayed quite a little\r\nwhile. Mr Barstowe read me some of his poems. It was perfectly lovely.\r\nI was quite sorry when Roberts told us we could go on again. But do you\r\nreally mean to tell me, Mr Lambert, that you--'\r\n\r\nAnd once more the world became all shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen the men trailed into the presence of the ladies for that brief\r\nseance on which etiquette insisted before permitting the stampede to\r\nthe billiard-room, Elsa was not to be seen.\r\n\r\n'Elsa?' said Mrs Keith in answer to Martin's question. 'She has gone to\r\nbed. The poor child has a headache. I am afraid she had a tiring day.'\r\n\r\nThere was an early start for the guns next morning, and as Elsa did not\r\nappear at breakfast Martin had to leave without seeing her. His\r\nshooting was even worse than it had been on the previous day.\r\n\r\nIt was not until late in the evening that the party returned to the\r\nhouse. Martin, on the way to his room, met Mrs Keith on the stairs. She\r\nappeared somewhat agitated.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Martin,' she said. 'I'm so glad you're back. Have you seen\r\nanything of Elsa?'\r\n\r\n'Elsa?'\r\n\r\n'Wasn't she with the guns?'\r\n\r\n'With the guns' said Martin, puzzled. 'No.'\r\n\r\n'I have seen nothing of her all day. I'm getting worried. I can't think\r\nwhat can have happened to her. Are you sure she wasn't with the guns?'\r\n\r\n'Absolutely certain. Didn't she come in to lunch?'\r\n\r\n'No. Tom,' she said, as Mr Keith came up, 'I'm so worried about Elsa. I\r\nhaven't seen her all day. I thought she must be out with the guns.'\r\n\r\nMr Keith was a man who had built up a large fortune mainly by\r\nconsistently refusing to allow anything to agitate him. He carried this\r\npolicy into private life.\r\n\r\n'Wasn't she in at lunch?' he asked, placidly.\r\n\r\n'I tell you I haven't seen her all day. She breakfasted in her room--'\r\n\r\n'Late?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. She was tired, poor girl.'\r\n\r\n'If she breakfasted late,' said Mr Keith, 'she wouldn't need any lunch.\r\nShe's gone for a stroll somewhere.'\r\n\r\n'Would you put back dinner, do you think?' inquired Mrs Keith,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n'I am not good at riddles,' said Mr Keith, comfortably, 'but I can\r\nanswer that one. I would not put back dinner. I would not put back\r\ndinner for the King.'\r\n\r\nElsa did not come back for dinner. Nor was hers the only vacant place.\r\nMr Barstowe had also vanished. Even Mr Keith's calm was momentarily\r\nruffled by this discovery. The poet was not a favourite of his--it was\r\nonly reluctantly that he had consented to his being invited at all; and\r\nthe presumption being that when two members of a house-party disappear\r\nsimultaneously they are likely to be spending the time in each other's\r\nsociety, he was annoyed. Elsa was not the girl to make a fool of\r\nherself, of course, but--He was unwontedly silent at dinner.\r\n\r\nMrs Keith's anxiety displayed itself differently. She was frankly\r\nworried, and mentioned it. By the time the fish had been reached\r\nconversation at the table had fixed itself definitely on the one\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\n'It isn't the car this time, at any rate,' said Mr Keith. 'It hasn't\r\nbeen out today.'\r\n\r\n'I can't understand it,' said Mrs Keith for the twentieth time. And\r\nthat was the farthest point reached in the investigation of the\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nBy the time dinner was over a spirit of unrest was abroad. The company\r\nsat about in uneasy groups. Snooker-pool was, if not forgotten, at any\r\nrate shelved. Somebody suggested search-parties, and one or two of the\r\nmoustache-tuggers wandered rather aimlessly out into the darkness.\r\n\r\nMartin was standing in the porch with Mr Keith when Keggs approached.\r\nAs his eyes lit on him, Martin was conscious of a sudden solidifying of\r\nthe vague suspicion which had been forming in his mind. And yet that\r\nsuspicion seemed so wild. How could Keggs, with the worst intentions,\r\nhave had anything to do with this? He could not forcibly have abducted\r\nthe missing pair and kept them under lock and key. He could not have\r\nstunned them and left them in a ditch. Nevertheless, looking at him\r\nstanding there in his attitude of deferential dignity, with the light\r\nfrom the open door shining on his bald head, Martin felt perfectly\r\ncertain that he had in some mysterious fashion engineered the whole\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n'Might I have a word, sir, if you are at leisure?'\r\n\r\n'Well, Keggs?'\r\n\r\n'Miss Elsa, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\nKegg's voice took on a sympathetic softness.\r\n\r\n'It was not my place, sir, to make any remark while in the dining-room,\r\nbut I could not 'elp but hoverhear the conversation. I gathered from\r\nremarks that was passed that you was somewhat hat a loss to account for\r\nMiss Elsa's non-appearance, sir.'\r\n\r\nMr Keith laughed shortly.\r\n\r\n'You gathered that, eh?'\r\n\r\nKeggs bowed.\r\n\r\n'I think, sir, that possibly I may be hable to throw light on the\r\nmatter.'\r\n\r\n'What!' cried Mr Keith. 'Great Scott, man! then why didn't you say so\r\nat the time? Where is she?'\r\n\r\n'It was not my place, sir, to henter into the conversation of the\r\ndinner-table,' said the butler, with a touch of reproof. 'If I might\r\nspeak now, sir?'\r\n\r\nMr Keith clutched at his forehead.\r\n\r\n'Heavens above! Do you want a signed permit to tell me where my\r\ndaughter is? Get on, man, get on!'\r\n\r\n'I think it 'ighly possible, sir, that Miss Elsa and Mr Barstowe may be\r\non the hisland in the lake, sir.' About half a mile from the house was\r\na picturesque strip of water, some fifteen hundred yards in width and a\r\nlittle less in length, in the centre of which stood a small and densely\r\nwooded island. It was a favourite haunt of visitors at the house when\r\nthere was nothing else to engage their attention, but during the past\r\nweek, with shooting to fill up the days, it had been neglected.\r\n\r\n'On the island?' said Mr Keith. 'What put that idea into your head?'\r\n\r\n'I 'appened to be rowing on the lake this morning, sir. I frequently\r\nrow of a morning, sir, when there are no duties to detain me in the\r\n'ouse. I find the hexercise hadmirable for the 'ealth. I walk briskly\r\nto the boat-'ouse, and--'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes. I don't want a schedule of your daily exercises. Cut out the\r\nathletic reminiscences and come to the point.'\r\n\r\n'As I was rowing on the lake this morning, sir, I 'appened to see a\r\nboat 'itched up to a tree on the hisland. I think that possibly Miss\r\nElsa and Mr Barstowe might 'ave taken a row out there. Mr Barstowe\r\nwould wish to see the hisland, sir, bein' romantic.'\r\n\r\n'But you say you saw the boat there this morning?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it doesn't take all day to explore a small island. What's kept\r\nthem all this while?'\r\n\r\n'It is possible, sir, that the rope might not have 'eld. Mr Barstowe,\r\nif I might say so, sir, is one of those himpetuous literary pussons,\r\nand possibly he homitted to see that the knot was hadequately tied.\r\nOr'--his eye, grave and inscrutable, rested for a moment on\r\nMartin's--'some party might 'ave come along and huntied it a-puppus.'\r\n\r\n'Untied it on purpose?' said Mr Keith. 'What on earth for?'\r\n\r\nKeggs shook his head deprecatingly, as one who, realizing his\r\nlimitations, declines to attempt to probe the hidden sources of human\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n'I thought it right, sir, to let you know,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Right? I should say so. If Elsa has been kept starving all day on that\r\nisland by that long-haired--Here, come along, Martin.'\r\n\r\nHe dashed off excitedly into the night. Martin remained for a moment\r\ngazing fixedly at the butler.\r\n\r\n'I 'ope, sir,' said Keggs, cordially, 'that my hinformation will prove\r\nof genuine hassistance.'\r\n\r\n'Do you know what I should like to do to you?' said Martin slowly.\r\n\r\n'I think I 'ear Mr Keith calling you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I should like to take you by the scruff of your neck and--'\r\n\r\n'There, sir! Didn't you 'ear 'im then? Quite distinct it was.'\r\n\r\nMartin gave up the struggle with a sense of blank futility. What could\r\nyou do with a man like this? It was like quarrelling with Westminster\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\n'I should 'urry, sir,' suggested Keggs, respectfully. 'I think Mr Keith\r\nmust have met with some haccident.'\r\n\r\nHis surmise proved correct. When Martin came up he found his host\r\nseated on the ground in evident pain.\r\n\r\n'Twisted my ankle in a hole,' he explained, briefly. 'Give me an arm\r\nback to the house, there's a good fellow, and then run on down to the\r\nlake and see if what Keggs said is true.'\r\n\r\nMartin did as he was requested--so far, that is to say, as the first\r\nhalf of the commission was concerned. As regarded the second, he took\r\nit upon himself to make certain changes. Having seen Mr Keith to his\r\nroom, he put the fitting-out of the relief ship into the good hands of\r\na group of his fellow guests whom he discovered in the porch. Elsa's\r\nfeelings towards her rescuer might be one of unmixed gratitude; but it\r\nmight, on the other hand, be one of resentment. He did not wish her to\r\nconnect him in her mind with the episode in any way whatsoever. Martin\r\nhad once released a dog from a trap, and the dog had bitten him. He had\r\nbeen on an errand of mercy, but the dog had connected him with his\r\nsufferings and acted accordingly. It occurred to Martin that Elsa's\r\nframe of mind would be uncommonly like that dog's.\r\n\r\nThe rescue-party set off. Martin lit a cigarette, and waited in the\r\nporch.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a very long time before anything happened, but at last, as he\r\nwas lighting his fifth cigarette, there came from the darkness the\r\nsound of voices. They drew nearer. Someone shouted:\r\n\r\n'It's all right. We've found them.'\r\n\r\nMartin threw away his cigarette and went indoors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElsa Keith sat up as her mother came into the room. Two nights and a\r\nday had passed since she had taken to her bed.\r\n\r\n'How are you feeling today, dear?'\r\n\r\n'Has he gone, mother?'\r\n\r\n'Who?'\r\n\r\n'Mr Barstowe?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear. He left this morning. He said he had business with his\r\npublisher in London.'\r\n\r\n'Then I can get up,' said Elsa, thankfully.\r\n\r\n'I think you're a little hard on poor Mr Barstowe, Elsa. It was just an\r\naccident, you know. It was not his fault that the boat slipped away.'\r\n\r\n'It was, it was, it _was_!' cried Elsa, thumping the pillow\r\nmalignantly. 'I believe he did it on purpose, so that he could read me\r\nhis horrid poetry without my having a chance to escape. I believe\r\nthat's the only way he can get people to listen to it.'\r\n\r\n'But you used to like it, darling. You said he had such a musical\r\nvoice.'\r\n\r\n'Musical voice!' The pillow became a shapeless heap. 'Mother, it was\r\nlike a nightmare! If I had seen him again I should have had hysterics.\r\nIt was _awful_! If he had been even the least bit upset himself I\r\nthink I could have borne up. But he _enjoyed_ it! He _revelled_\r\nin it! He said it was like Omar Khayyam in the Wilderness and Shelley's\r\n_Epipsychidion_, whatever that is; and he prattled on and on and\r\nread and read till my head began to split. Mother'--her voice sank to\r\na whisper--'I hit him!'\r\n\r\n'Elsa!'\r\n\r\n'I did!' she went on, defiantly. 'I hit him as hard as I could, and\r\nhe--he'--she broke off into a little gurgle of laughter--'he tripped\r\nover a bush and fell right down; and I wasn't a bit ashamed. I didn't\r\nthink it unladylike or anything. I was just as proud as I could be. And\r\nit stopped him talking.'\r\n\r\n'But, Elsa, _dear_! Why?'\r\n\r\n'The sun had just gone down; and it was a lovely sunset, and the sky\r\nlooked like a great, beautiful slice of underdone beef; and I said so\r\nto him, and he said, sniffily, that he was afraid he didn't see the\r\nresemblance. And I asked him if he wasn't starving. And he said no,\r\nbecause as a rule all that he needed was a little ripe fruit. And that\r\nwas when I hit him.'\r\n\r\n'Elsa!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I know it was awfully wrong, but I just had to. And now I'll get\r\nup. It looks lovely out.'\r\n\r\nMartin had not gone out with the guns that day. Mrs Keith had assured\r\nhim that there was nothing wrong with Elsa, that she was only tired,\r\nbut he was anxious, and had remained at home, where bulletins could\r\nreach him. As he was returning from a stroll in the grounds he heard\r\nhis name called, and saw Elsa lying in the hammock under the trees near\r\nthe terrace.\r\n\r\n'Why, Martin, why aren't you out with the guns?' she said.\r\n\r\n'I wanted to be on the spot so that I could hear how you were.'\r\n\r\n'How nice of you! Why don't you sit down?'\r\n\r\n'May I?'\r\n\r\nElsa fluttered the pages of her magazine.\r\n\r\n'You know, you're a very restful person, Martin. You're so big and\r\noutdoory. How would you like to read to me for a while? I feel so\r\nlazy.'\r\n\r\nMartin took the magazine.\r\n\r\n'What shall I read? Here's a poem by--'\r\n\r\nElsa shuddered.\r\n\r\n'Oh, please, no,' she cried. 'I couldn't bear it. I'll tell you what I\r\nshould love--the advertisements. There's one about sardines. I started\r\nit, and it seemed splendid. It's at the back somewhere.'\r\n\r\n'Is this it--Langley and Fielding's sardines?'\r\n\r\n'That's it.'\r\n\r\nMartin began to read.\r\n\r\n'\"Langley and Fielding's sardines. When you want the daintiest, most\r\ndelicious sardines, go to your grocer and say, 'Langley and Fielding's,\r\nplease!' You will then be sure of having the finest Norwegian smoked\r\nsardines, packed in the purest olive oil.\"'\r\n\r\nElsa was sitting with her eyes closed and a soft smile of pleasure\r\ncurving her mouth.\r\n\r\n'Go on,' she said, dreamily.\r\n\r\n'\"Nothing nicer.\"' resumed Martin, with an added touch of eloquence as\r\nthe theme began to develop, '\"for breakfast, lunch, or supper. Probably\r\nyour grocer stocks them. Ask him. If he does not, write to us. Price\r\nfivepence per tin. The best sardines and the best oil!\"'\r\n\r\n'Isn't it _lovely_?' she murmured.\r\n\r\nHer hand, as it swung, touched his. He held it. She opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n'Don't stop reading,' she said. 'I never heard anything so soothing.'\r\n\r\n'Elsa!'\r\n\r\nHe bent towards her. She smiled at him. Her eyes were dancing.\r\n\r\n'Elsa, I--'\r\n\r\n'Mr Keith,' said a quiet voice, 'desired me to say--'\r\n\r\nMartin started away. He glared up furiously. Gazing down upon them\r\nstood Keggs. The butler's face was shining with a gentle benevolence.\r\n\r\n'Mr Keith desired me to say that he would be glad if Miss Elsa would\r\ncome and sit with him for a while.'\r\n\r\n'I'll come at once,' said Elsa, stepping from the hammock.\r\n\r\nThe butler bowed respectfully and turned away. They stood watching him\r\nas he moved across the terrace.\r\n\r\n'What a saintly old man Keggs looks,' said Elsa. 'Don't you think so?\r\nHe looks as if he had never even thought of doing anything he\r\nshouldn't. I wonder if he ever has?'\r\n\r\n'I wonder!' said Martin.\r\n\r\n'He looks like a stout angel. What were you saying, Martin, when he\r\ncame up?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTS O'MONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nOwen Bentley was feeling embarrassed. He looked at Mr Sheppherd, and\r\nwith difficulty restrained himself from standing on one leg and\r\ntwiddling his fingers. At one period of his career, before the\r\ninfluence of his uncle Henry had placed him in the London and Suburban\r\nBank, Owen had been an actor. On the strength of a batting average of\r\nthirty-three point nought seven for Middlesex, he had been engaged by\r\nthe astute musical-comedy impresario to whom the idea first occurred\r\nthat, if you have got to have young men to chant 'We are merry and gay,\r\ntra-la, for this is Bohemia,' in the Artists' Ball scene, you might\r\njust as well have young men whose names are known to the public. He had\r\nnot been an actor long, for loss of form had put him out of first-class\r\ncricket, and the impresario had given his place in the next piece to a\r\ngoogly bowler who had done well in the last Varsity match; but he had\r\nbeen one long enough to experience that sinking sensation which is\r\nknown as stage-fright. And now, as he began to explain to Mr Sheppherd\r\nthat he wished for his consent to marry his daughter Audrey, he found\r\nhimself suffering exactly the same symptoms.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start, from the moment when he revealed the fact that his\r\nincome, salary and private means included, amounted to less than two\r\nhundred pounds, he had realized that this was going to be one of his\r\nfailures. It was the gruesome Early Victorianness of it all that took\r\nthe heart out of him. Mr Sheppherd had always reminded him of a heavy\r\nfather out of a three-volume novel, but, compared with his demeanour as\r\nhe listened now, his attitude hitherto had been light and whimsical.\r\nUntil this moment Owen had not imagined that this sort of thing ever\r\nhappened nowadays outside the comic papers. By the end of the second\r\nminute he would not have been surprised to find himself sailing through\r\nthe air, urged by Mr Sheppherd's boot, his transit indicated by a\r\ndotted line and a few stars.\r\n\r\nMr Sheppherd's manner was inclined to bleakness.\r\n\r\n'This is most unfortunate,' he said. 'Most unfortunate. I have my\r\ndaughter's happiness to consider. It is my duty as a father.' He\r\npaused. 'You say you have no prospects? I should have supposed that\r\nyour uncle--? Surely, with his influence--?'\r\n\r\n'My uncle shot his bolt when he got me into the bank. That finished\r\nhim, as far as I'm concerned. I'm not his only nephew, you know. There\r\nare about a hundred others, all trailing him like bloodhounds.'\r\n\r\nMr Sheppherd coughed the small cough of disapproval. He was feeling\r\nmore than a little aggrieved.\r\n\r\nHe had met Owen for the first time at dinner at the house of his uncle\r\nHenry, a man of unquestioned substance, whose habit it was to invite\r\neach of his eleven nephews to dinner once a year. But Mr Sheppherd did\r\nnot know this. For all he knew, Owen was in the habit of hobnobbing\r\nwith the great man every night. He could not say exactly that it was\r\nsharp practice on Owen's part to accept his invitation to call, and,\r\nhaving called, to continue calling long enough to make the present\r\ndeplorable situation possible; but he felt that it would have been in\r\nbetter taste for the young man to have effaced himself and behaved more\r\nlike a bank-clerk and less like an heir.\r\n\r\n'I am exceedingly sorry for this, Mr Bentley,' he said, 'but you will\r\nunderstand that I cannot--It is, of course, out of the question. It\r\nwould be best, in the circumstances, I think, if you did not see my\r\ndaughter again--'\r\n\r\n'She's waiting in the passage outside,' said Owen, simply.\r\n\r\n'--after today. Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nOwen left the room. Audrey was hovering in the neighbourhood of the\r\ndoor. She came quickly up to him, and his spirits rose, as they always\r\ndid, at the sight of her.\r\n\r\n'Well?' she said.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n'No good,' he said.\r\n\r\nAudrey considered the problem for a moment, and was rewarded with an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n'Shall I go in and cry?'\r\n\r\n'It wouldn't be of any use.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me what happened.'\r\n\r\n'He said I mustn't see you again.'\r\n\r\n'He didn't mean it.'\r\n\r\n'He thinks he did.'\r\n\r\nAudrey reflected.\r\n\r\n'We shall simply have to keep writing, then. And we can talk on the\r\ntelephone. That isn't seeing each other. Has your bank a telephone?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. But--'\r\n\r\n'That's all right, then. I'll ring you up every day.'\r\n\r\n'I wish I could make some money,' said Owen, thoughtfully. 'But I seem\r\nto be one of those chaps who can't. Nothing I try comes off. I've never\r\ndrawn anything except a blank in a sweep. I spent about two pounds on\r\nsixpenny postal orders when the Limerick craze was on, and didn't win a\r\nthing. Once when I was on tour I worked myself to a shadow, dramatizing\r\na novel. Nothing came of that, either.'\r\n\r\n'What novel?'\r\n\r\n'A thing called _White Roses,_ by a woman named Edith Butler.'\r\n\r\nAudrey looked up quickly.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you knew her very well? Were you great friends?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't know her at all. I'd never met her. I just happened to buy\r\nthe thing at a bookstall, and thought it would make a good play. I\r\nexpect it was pretty bad rot. Anyhow, she never took the trouble to\r\nsend it back or even to acknowledge receipt.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps she never got it?'\r\n\r\n'I registered it.'\r\n\r\n'She was a cat,' said Audrey, decidedly. 'I'm glad of it, though. If\r\nanother woman had helped you make a lot of money, I should have died of\r\njealousy.'\r\n\r\nRoutine is death to heroism. For the first few days after his parting\r\nwith Mr Sheppherd, Owen was in heroic mood, full of vaguely dashing\r\nschemes, regarding the world as his oyster, and burning to get at it,\r\nsword in hand. But routine, with its ledgers and its copying-ink and\r\nits customers, fell like a grey cloud athwart his horizon, blotting out\r\nrainbow visions of sudden wealth, dramatically won. Day by day the glow\r\nfaded and hopelessness grew.\r\n\r\nIf the glow did not entirely fade it was due to Audrey, who more than\r\nfulfilled her promise of ringing him up on the telephone. She rang him\r\nup at least once, frequently several times, every day, a fact which was\r\nnoted and commented upon in a harshly critical spirit by the head of\r\nhis department, a man with no soul and a strong objection to doing his\r\nsubordinates' work for them.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, her conversation, though pleasing, was discursive and lacked\r\ncentral motive, but one morning she had genuine news to impart.\r\n\r\n'Owen'--her voice was excited--'have you seen the paper today? Then\r\nlisten. I'll read it out. Are you listening? This is what it says: \"The\r\nPiccadilly Theatre will reopen shortly with a dramatized version of\r\nMiss Edith Butler's popular novel, _White Roses_, prepared by the\r\nauthoress herself. A strong cast is being engaged, including--\" And\r\nthen a lot of names. What are you going to do about it, Owen?'\r\n\r\n'What am I going to do?'\r\n\r\n'Don't you see what's happened? That awful woman has stolen your play.\r\nShe has waited all these years, hoping you would forget. What are you\r\nlaughing at?'\r\n\r\n'I wasn't laughing.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you were. It tickled my ear. I'll ring off if you do it again.\r\nYou don't believe me. Well, you wait and see if I'm not--'\r\n\r\n'Edith Butler's incapable of such a thing.'\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause at the other end of the wire.\r\n\r\n'I thought you said you didn't know her,' said Audrey, jealously.\r\n\r\n'I don't--I don't,' said Owen, hastily. 'But I've read her books.\r\nThey're simply chunks of superfatted sentiment. She's a sort of\r\nliterary onion. She compels tears. A woman like that couldn't steal a\r\nplay if she tried.'\r\n\r\n'You can't judge authors from their books. You must go and see the play\r\nwhen it comes on. Then you'll see I'm right. I'm absolutely certain\r\nthat woman is trying to swindle you. Don't laugh in that horrid way.\r\nVery well, I told you I should ring off, and now I'm going to.'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the next month Owen's annual holiday arrived. The\r\nauthorities of the London and Suburban Bank were no niggards. They\r\nrecognized that a man is not a machine. They gave their employees ten\r\ndays in the year in which to tone up their systems for another twelve\r\nmonths' work.\r\n\r\nOwen spent his boyhood in the Shropshire village of which his father\r\nhad been rector, and thither he went when his holiday came round, to\r\nthe farm of one Dorman. He was glad of the chance to get to Shropshire.\r\nThere is something about the country there, with its green fields and\r\nminiature rivers, that soothes the wounded spirit and forms a pleasant\r\nbackground for sentimental musings.\r\n\r\nIt was comfortable at the farm. The household consisted of Mr Dorman,\r\nan old acquaintance, his ten-year-old son George, and Mr Dorman's\r\nmother, an aged lady with a considerable local reputation as a wise\r\nwoman. Rumour had it that the future held no mysteries for her, and it\r\nwas known that she could cure warts, bruised fingers, and even the\r\nbotts by means of spells.\r\n\r\nExcept for these, Owen had fancied that he was alone in the house. It\r\nseemed not, however. There was a primeval piano in his sitting-room,\r\nand on the second morning it suited his mood to sit down at this and\r\nsing 'Asthore', the fruity pathos of which ballad appealed to him\r\nstrongly at this time, accompanying himself by an ingenious arrangement\r\nin three chords. He had hardly begun, however, when Mr Dorman appeared,\r\nsomewhat agitated.\r\n\r\n'If you don't mind, Mr Owen,' he said. 'I forgot to tell you. There's a\r\nlit'ery gent boarding with me in the room above, and he can't bear to\r\nbe disturbed.'\r\n\r\nA muffled stamping from the ceiling bore out his words.\r\n\r\n'Writing a book he is,' continued Mr Dorman. 'He caught young George a\r\nclip over the ear-'ole yesterday for blowing his trumpet on the stairs.\r\nGave him sixpence afterwards, and said he'd skin him if he ever did it\r\nagain. So, if you don't mind--'\r\n\r\n'Oh, all right,' said Owen. 'Who is he?'\r\n\r\n'Gentleman of the name of Prosser.'\r\n\r\nOwen could not recollect having come across any work by anyone of that\r\nname; but he was not a wide reader; and, whether the man above was a\r\ncelebrity or not, he was entitled to quiet.\r\n\r\n'I never heard of him,' he said, 'but that's no reason why I should\r\ndisturb him. Let him rip. I'll cut out the musical effects in future.'\r\n\r\nThe days passed smoothly by. The literary man remained invisible,\r\nthough occasionally audible, tramping the floor in the frenzy of\r\ncomposition. Nor, until the last day of his visit, did Owen see old Mrs\r\nDorman.\r\n\r\nThat she was not unaware of his presence in the house, however, was\r\nindicated on the last morning. He was smoking an after-breakfast pipe\r\nat the open window and waiting for the dog-cart that was to take him to\r\nthe station, when George, the son of the house, entered.\r\n\r\nGeorge stood in the doorway, grinned, and said:\r\n\r\n'Farsezjerligranmatellyerforchbythecards?'\r\n\r\n'Eh?' said Owen.\r\n\r\nThe youth repeated the word.\r\n\r\n'Once again.'\r\n\r\nOn the second repetition light began to creep in. A boyhood spent in\r\nthe place, added to this ten days' stay, had made Owen something of a\r\nlinguist.\r\n\r\n'Father says would I like grandma to do what?'\r\n\r\n'Tell yer forch'n by ther cards.'\r\n\r\n'Where is she?'\r\n\r\n'Backyarnder.'\r\n\r\nOwen followed him into the kitchen, where he found Mr Dorman, the\r\nfarmer, and, seated at the table, fumbling with a pack of cards, an old\r\nwoman, whom he remembered well.\r\n\r\n'Mother wants to tell your fortune,' said Mr Dorman, in a hoarse aside.\r\n'She always will tell visitors' fortunes. She told Mr Prosser's, and he\r\ndidn't half like it, because she said he'd be engaged in two months and\r\nmarried inside the year. He said wild horses wouldn't make him do it.'\r\n\r\n'She can tell me that if she likes. I shan't object.'\r\n\r\n'Mother, here's Mr Owen.'\r\n\r\n'I seed him fast enough,' said the old woman, briskly. 'Shuffle, an' cut\r\nthree times.'\r\n\r\nShe then performed mysterious manoeuvres with the cards.\r\n\r\n'I see pots o' money,' announced the sibyl.\r\n\r\n'If she says it, it's there right enough,' said her son.\r\n\r\n'She means my bonus,' said Owen. 'But that's only ten pounds. And I lose\r\nit if I'm late twice more before Christmas.'\r\n\r\n'It'll come sure enough.'\r\n\r\n'Pots,' said the old woman, and she was still mumbling the encouraging\r\nword when Owen left the kitchen and returned to the sitting-room.\r\n\r\nHe laughed rather ruefully. At that moment he could have found a use\r\nfor pots o' money.\r\n\r\nHe walked to the window, and looked out. It was a glorious morning. The\r\nheat-mist was dancing over the meadow beyond the brook, and from the\r\nfarmyard came the liquid charawks of care-free fowls. It seemed wicked\r\nto leave these haunts of peace for London on such a day.\r\n\r\nAn acute melancholy seized him. Absently, he sat down at the piano. The\r\nprejudices of literary Mr Prosser had slipped from his mind. Softly at\r\nfirst, then gathering volume as the spirit of the song gripped him, he\r\nbegan to sing 'Asthore'. He became absorbed.\r\n\r\nHe had just, for the sixth time, won through to 'Iyam-ah waiting for-er\r\ntheeee-yass-thorre,' and was doing some intricate three-chord work\r\npreparatory to starting over again, when a loaf of bread whizzed past\r\nhis ear. It missed him by an inch, and crashed against a plaster\r\nstatuette of the Infant Samuel on the top of the piano.\r\n\r\nIt was a standard loaf, containing eighty per cent of semolina, and it\r\npractically wiped the Infant Samuel out of existence. At the same\r\nmoment, at his back, there sounded a loud, wrathful snort.\r\n\r\nHe spun round. The door was open, and at the other side of the table\r\nwas standing a large, black-bearded, shirt-sleeved man, in an attitude\r\nrather reminiscent of Ajax defying the lightning. His hands trembled.\r\nHis beard bristled. His eyes gleamed ferociously beneath enormous\r\neyebrows. As Owen turned, he gave tongue in a voice like the discharge\r\nof a broadside.\r\n\r\n'Stop it!'\r\n\r\nOwen's mind, wrenched too suddenly from the dreamy future to the vivid\r\npresent, was not yet completely under control. He gaped.\r\n\r\n'Stop--that--infernal--noise!' roared the man.\r\n\r\nHe shot through the door, banging it after him, and pounded up the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nOwen was annoyed. The artistic temperament was all very well, but\r\nthere were limits. It was absurd that obscure authors should behave in\r\nthis way. Prosser! Who on earth was Prosser? Had anyone ever heard of\r\nhim? No! Yet here he was going about the country clipping small boys\r\nover the ear-hole, and flinging loaves of bread at bank-clerks as if he\r\nwere Henry James or Marie Corelli. Owen reproached himself bitterly for\r\nhis momentary loss of presence of mind. If he had only kept his head,\r\nhe could have taken a flying shot at the man with the marmalade-pot. It\r\nhad been within easy reach. Instead of which, he had merely stood and\r\ngaped. Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, 'It\r\nmight have been.'\r\n\r\nHis manly regret was interrupted by the entrance of Mr Dorman with the\r\ninformation that the dog-cart was at the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAudrey was out of town when Owen arrived in London, but she returned a\r\nweek later. The sound of her voice through the telephone did much to\r\ncure the restlessness from which he had been suffering since the\r\nconclusion of his holiday. But the thought that she was so near yet so\r\ninaccessible produced in him a meditative melancholy which enveloped\r\nhim like a cloud that would not lift. His manner became distrait. He\r\nlost weight.\r\n\r\nIf customers were not vaguely pained by his sad, pale face, it was only\r\nbecause the fierce rush of modern commercial life leaves your business\r\nman little leisure for observing pallor in bank-clerks. What did pain\r\nthem was the gentle dreaminess with which he performed his duties. He\r\nwas in the Inward Bills Department, one of the features of which was\r\nthe sudden inrush, towards the end of each afternoon, of hatless,\r\nenergetic young men with leather bags strapped to their left arms,\r\nclamouring for mysterious crackling documents, much fastened with pins.\r\nOwen had never quite understood what it was that these young men did\r\nwant, and now his detached mind refused even more emphatically to\r\ngrapple with the problem. He distributed the documents at random with\r\nthe air of a preoccupied monarch scattering largess to the mob, and the\r\nsubsequent chaos had to be handled by a wrathful head of the department\r\nin person.\r\n\r\nMan's power of endurance is limited. At the end of the second week the\r\noverwrought head appealed passionately for relief, and Owen was removed\r\nto the Postage Department, where, when he had leisure from answering\r\nAudrey's telephone calls, he entered the addresses of letters in a\r\nlarge book and took them to the post. He was supposed also to stamp\r\nthem, but a man in love cannot think of everything, and he was apt at\r\ntimes to overlook this formality.\r\n\r\nOne morning, receiving from one of the bank messengers the usual\r\nintimation that a lady wished to speak to him on the telephone, he went\r\nto the box and took up the receiver.\r\n\r\n'Is that you, Owen? Owen, I went to _White Roses_ last night. Have\r\nyou been yet?'\r\n\r\n'Not yet.'\r\n\r\n'Then you must go tonight. Owen, I'm _certain_ you wrote it. It's\r\nperfectly lovely. I cried my eyes out. If you don't go tonight, I'll\r\nnever speak to you again, even on the telephone. Promise.'\r\n\r\n'Must I?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you must. Why, suppose it _is_ yours! It may mean a fortune.\r\nThe stalls were simply packed. I'm going to ring up the theatre now and\r\nengage a seat for you, and pay for it myself.'\r\n\r\n'No--I say--' protested Owen.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I shall. I can't trust you to go if I don't. And I'll ring up\r\nearly tomorrow to hear all about it. Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nOwen left the box somewhat depressed. Life was quite gloomy enough as\r\nit was, without going out of one's way to cry one's eyes out over\r\nsentimental plays.\r\n\r\nHis depression was increased by the receipt, on his return to his\r\ndepartment, of a message from the manager, stating that he would like\r\nto see Mr Bentley in his private room for a moment. Owen never enjoyed\r\nthese little chats with Authority. Out of office hours, in the circle\r\nof his friends, he had no doubt the manager was a delightful and\r\nentertaining companion; but in his private room his conversation was\r\nless enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThe manager was seated at his table, thoughtfully regarding the\r\nceiling. His resemblance to a stuffed trout, always striking, was\r\nsubtly accentuated, and Owen, an expert in these matters, felt that his\r\nfears had been well founded--there was trouble in the air. Somebody had\r\nbeen complaining of him, and he was now about, as the phrase went, to\r\nbe 'run-in'.\r\n\r\nA large man, seated with his back to the door, turned as he entered,\r\nand Owen recognized the well-remembered features of Mr Prosser, the\r\nliterary loaf-slinger.\r\n\r\nOwen regarded him without resentment. Since returning to London he had\r\ntaken the trouble of looking up his name in _Who's Who_ and had\r\nfound that he was not so undistinguished as he had supposed. He was, it\r\nappeared, a Regius Professor and the author of some half-dozen works on\r\nsociology--a record, Owen felt, that almost justified loaf-slinging and\r\near-hole clipping in moments of irritation.\r\n\r\nThe manager started to speak, but the man of letters anticipated him.\r\n\r\n'Is this the fool?' he roared. 'Young man, I have no wish to be hard on\r\na congenital idiot who is not responsible for his actions, but I must\r\ninsist on an explanation. I understand that you are in charge of the\r\ncorrespondence in this office. Well, during the last week you have\r\nthree times sent unstamped letters to my fiancee, Miss Vera Delane,\r\nWoodlands, Southbourne, Hants. What's the matter with you? Do you think\r\nshe likes paying twopence a time, or what is it?'\r\n\r\nOwen's mind leaped back at the words. They recalled something to him.\r\nThen he remembered.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of a not unpleasant thrill. He had not known that he\r\nwas superstitious, but for some reason he had not been able to get\r\nthose absurd words of Mr Dorman's mother out of his mind. And here was\r\nanother prediction of hers, equally improbable, fulfilled to the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n'Great Scott!' he cried. 'Are you going to be married?'\r\n\r\nMr Prosser and the manager started simultaneously.\r\n\r\n'Mrs Dorman said you would be,' said Owen. 'Don't you remember?'\r\n\r\nMr Prosser looked keenly at him.\r\n\r\n'Why, I've seen you before,' he said. 'You're the young turnip-headed\r\nscallywag at the farm.'\r\n\r\n'That's right,' said Owen.\r\n\r\n'I've been wanting to meet you again. I thought the whole thing over,\r\nand it struck me,' said Mr Prosser, handsomely, 'that I may have seemed\r\na little abrupt at our last meeting.'\r\n\r\n'No, no.'\r\n\r\n'The fact is, I was in the middle of an infernally difficult passage of\r\nmy book that morning, and when you began--'\r\n\r\n'It was my fault entirely. I quite understand.'\r\n\r\nMr Prosser produced a card-case.\r\n\r\n'We must see more of each other,' he said. 'Come and have a bit of\r\ndinner some night. Come tonight.'\r\n\r\n'I'm very sorry. I have to go to the theatre tonight.'\r\n\r\n'Then come and have a bit of supper afterwards. Excellent. Meet me at\r\nthe Savoy at eleven-fifteen. I'm glad I didn't hit you with that loaf.\r\nAbruptness has been my failing through life. My father was just the\r\nsame. Eleven-fifteen at the Savoy, then.'\r\n\r\nThe manager, who had been listening with some restlessness to the\r\nconversation, now intervened. He was a man with a sense of fitness of\r\nthings, and he objected to having his private room made the scene of\r\nwhat appeared to be a reunion of old college chums. He hinted as much.\r\n\r\n'Ha! Prrumph!' he observed, disapprovingly. 'Er--Mr Bentley, that is\r\nall. You may return to your work--ah'mmm! Kindly be more careful\r\nanother time in stamping the letters.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, by Jove,' said Mr Prosser, suddenly reminded of his wrongs,\r\n'that's right. Exercise a little ordinary care, you ivory-skulled\r\nyoung son of a gun. Do you think Miss Delane is _made_ of\r\ntwopences? Keep an eye on him,' he urged the manager. 'These young\r\nfellows nowadays want someone standing over them with a knout all the\r\ntime. Be more careful another time, young man. Eleven-fifteen,\r\nremember. Make a note of it, or you'll go forgetting _that_.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seat Audrey had bought for him at the Piccadilly Theatre proved to\r\nbe in the centre of the sixth row of stalls--practically a death-trap.\r\nWhatever his sufferings might be, escape was impossible. He was\r\nsecurely wedged in.\r\n\r\nThe cheaper parts of the house were sparsely occupied, but the stalls\r\nwere full. Owen, disapproving of the whole business, refused to buy a\r\nprogramme, and settled himself in his seat prepared for the worst. He\r\nhad a vivid recollection of _White Roses_, the novel, and he did\r\nnot anticipate any keen enjoyment from it in its dramatized form. He\r\nhad long ceased to be a member of that large public for which Miss\r\nEdith Butler catered. The sentimental adventures of governesses in\r\nducal houses--the heroine of _White Roses_ was a governess--no\r\nlonger contented his soul.\r\n\r\nThere is always a curiously dream-like atmosphere about a play founded\r\non a book. One seems to have seen it all before. During the whole of\r\nthe first act Owen attributed to this his feeling of familiarity with\r\nwhat was going on on the stage. At the beginning of the second act he\r\nfound himself anticipating events. But it was not till the third act\r\nthat the truth sank in.\r\n\r\nThe third was the only act in which, in his dramatization, he had taken\r\nany real liberties with the text of the novel. But in this act he had\r\nintroduced a character who did not appear in the novel--a creature of\r\nhis own imagination. And now, with bulging eyes, he observed this\r\ncreature emerge from the wings, and heard him utter lines which he now\r\nclearly remembered having written.\r\n\r\nAudrey had been right! Serpent Edith Butler had stolen his play.\r\n\r\nHis mind, during the remainder of the play, was active. By the time the\r\nfinal curtain fell and he passed out into the open air he had perceived\r\nsome of the difficulties of the case. To prove oneself the author of an\r\noriginal play is hard, but not impossible. Friends to whom one had\r\nsketched the plot may come forward as witnesses. One may have preserved\r\nrough notes. But a dramatization of a novel is another matter. All\r\ndramatizations of any given novel must necessarily be very much alike.\r\n\r\nHe started to walk along Piccadilly, and had reached Hyde Park Corner\r\nbefore he recollected that he had an engagement to take supper with Mr\r\nProsser at the Savoy Hotel. He hailed a cab.\r\n\r\n'You're late,' boomed the author of sociological treatises, as he\r\nappeared. 'You're infernally late. I suppose, in your woollen-headed\r\nway, you forgot all about it. Come along. We'll just have time for an\r\nolive and a glass of something before they turn the lights out.'\r\n\r\nOwen was still thinking deeply as he began his supper. Surely there was\r\nsome way by which he could prove his claims. What had he done with the\r\noriginal manuscript? He remembered now. He had burnt it. It had seemed\r\nmere useless litter then. Probably, he felt bitterly, the woman Butler\r\nhad counted on this.\r\n\r\nMr Prosser concluded an animated conversation with a waiter on the\r\nsubject of the wines of France, leaned forward, and, having helped\r\nhimself briskly to anchovies, began to talk. He talked loudly and\r\nrapidly. Owen, his thoughts far away, hardly listened.\r\n\r\nPresently the waiter returned with the selected brand. He filled Owen's\r\nglass, and Owen drank, and felt better. Finding his glass magically\r\nfull once more, he emptied it again. And then suddenly he found himself\r\nlooking across the table at his Host, and feeling a sense of absolute\r\nconviction that this was the one man of all others whom he would have\r\nselected as a confidant. How kindly, though somewhat misty, his face\r\nwas! How soothing, if a little indistinct, his voice!\r\n\r\n'Prosser,' he said, 'you are a man of the world, and I should like your\r\nadvice. What would you do in a case like this? I go to a theatre to see\r\na play, and what do I find?'\r\n\r\nHe paused, and eyed his host impressively.\r\n\r\n'What's that tune they're playing?' said Mr Prosser. 'You hear it\r\neverywhere. One of these Viennese things, I suppose.'\r\n\r\nOwen was annoyed. He began to doubt whether, after all, Mr Prosser's\r\nvirtues as a confidant were not more apparent than real.\r\n\r\n'I find, by Jove,' he continued, 'that I wrote the thing myself.'\r\n\r\n'It's not a patch on _The Merry Widow_,' said Mr Prosser.\r\n\r\nOwen thumped the table.\r\n\r\n'I tell you I find I wrote the thing myself.'\r\n\r\n'What thing?'\r\n\r\n'This play I'm telling you about. This _White Roses_ thing.'\r\n\r\nHe found that he had at last got his host's ear. Mr Prosser seemed\r\ngenuinely interested.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\nOwen plunged on with his story. He started from its dim beginning, from\r\nthe days when he had bought the novel on his journey from Bath to\r\nCheltenham. He described his methods of work, his registering of the\r\npackage, his suspense, his growing resignation. He sketched the\r\nprogress of his life. He spoke of Audrey and gave a crisp\r\ncharacter-sketch of Mr Sheppherd. He took his hearer right up to\r\nthe moment when the truth had come home to him.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his narrative the lights went out, and he finished\r\nhis story in the hotel courtyard. In the cool air he felt revived. The\r\noutlines of Mr Prosser became sharp and distinct again.\r\n\r\nThe sociologist listened admirably. He appeared absorbed, and did not\r\ninterrupt once.\r\n\r\n'What makes you so certain that this was your version?' he asked, as\r\nthey passed into the Strand.\r\n\r\nOwen told him of the creature of his imagination in Act III.\r\n\r\n'But you have lost your manuscript?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I burnt it.'\r\n\r\n'Just what one might have expected you to do,' said Mr Prosser,\r\nunkindly. 'Young man, I begin to believe that there may be something in\r\nthis. You haven't got a ghost of a proof that would hold water in a\r\ncourt of law, of course; but still, I'm inclined to believe you. For\r\none thing, you haven't the intelligence to invent such a story.'\r\n\r\nOwen thanked him.\r\n\r\n'In fact, if you can answer me one question I shall be satisfied.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Owen that Mr Prosser was tending to get a little above\r\nhimself. As an intelligent listener he had been of service, but that\r\nappeared to be no reason why he should constitute himself a sort of\r\njudge and master of the ceremonies.\r\n\r\n'That's very good of you,' he said; 'but will Edith Butler be\r\nsatisfied? That's more to the point.'\r\n\r\n'I _am_ Edith Butler,' said Mr Prosser.\r\n\r\nOwen stopped. 'You?'\r\n\r\n'You need not babble it from the house-tops. You are the only person\r\nbesides my agent who knows it, and I wouldn't have told you if I could\r\nhave helped it. It isn't a thing I want known. Great Scott, man, don't\r\ngoggle at me like a fish! Haven't you heard of pseudonyms before?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but--'\r\n\r\n'Well, never mind. Take it from me that I _am_ Edith Butler. Now\r\nlisten to me. That manuscript reached me when I was in the country.\r\nThere was no name on it. That in itself points strongly to the fact\r\nthat you were its author. It was precisely the chuckle-headed sort of\r\nthing you would have done, to put no name on the thing.'\r\n\r\n'I enclosed a letter, anyhow.'\r\n\r\n'There was a letter enclosed. I opened the parcel out of doors. There\r\nwas a fresh breeze blowing at the time. It caught the letter, and that\r\nwas the last I saw of it. I had read as far as \"Dear Madam\". But one\r\nthing I do remember about it, and that was that it was sent from some\r\nhotel in Cheltenham, and I could remember it if I heard it. Now, then?'\r\n\r\n'I can tell it you. It was Wilbraham's. I was stopping there.'\r\n\r\n'You pass,' said Mr Prosser. 'It was Wilbraham's.'\r\n\r\nOwen's heart gave a jump. For a moment he walked on air.\r\n\r\n'Then do you mean to say that it's all right--that you believe--'\r\n\r\n'I do,' said Mr Prosser. 'By the way,' he said, 'the notice of _White\r\nRoses_ went up last night.'\r\n\r\nOwen's heart turned to lead.\r\n\r\n'But--but--' he stammered. 'But tonight the house was packed.'\r\n\r\n'It was. Packed with paper. All the merry dead-heads in London were\r\nthere. It has been the worst failure this season. And, by George,' he\r\ncried, with sudden vehemence, 'serve 'em right. If I told them once it\r\nwould fail in England, I told them a hundred times. The London public\r\nwon't stand that sort of blithering twaddle.'\r\n\r\nOwen stopped and looked round. A cab was standing across the road. He\r\nsignalled to it. He felt incapable of walking home. No physical blow\r\ncould have unmanned him more completely than this hideous\r\ndisappointment just when, by a miracle, everything seemed to be running\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\n'Sooner ride than walk,' said Mr Prosser, pushing his head through the\r\nopen window. 'Laziness--slackness--that's the curse of the modern young\r\nman. Where shall I tell him to drive to?'\r\n\r\nOwen mentioned his address. It struck him that he had not thanked his\r\nhost for his hospitality.\r\n\r\n'It was awfully good of you to give me supper, Mr Prosser,' he said.\r\n'I've enjoyed it tremendously.'\r\n\r\n'Come again,' said Mr Prosser. 'I'm afraid you're disappointed about\r\nthe play?'\r\n\r\nOwen forced a smile.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, that's all right,' he said. 'It can't be helped.'\r\n\r\nMr Prosser half turned, then thrust his head through the window again.\r\n\r\n'I knew there was something I had forgotten to say,' he said. 'I ought\r\nto have told you that the play was produced in America before it came\r\nto London. It ran two seasons in New York and one in Chicago, and there\r\nare three companies playing it still on the road. Here's my card. Come\r\nround and see me tomorrow. I can't tell you the actual figures\r\noff-hand, but you'll be all right. You'll have pots o' money.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUT OF SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nMark you, I am not defending James Datchett. I hold no brief for James.\r\nOn the contrary, I am very decidedly of the opinion that he should not\r\nhave done it. I merely say that there were extenuating circumstances.\r\nJust that. Ext. circ. Nothing more.\r\n\r\nLet us review the matter calmly and judicially, not condemning James\r\noff-hand, but rather probing the whole affair to its core, to see if we\r\ncan confirm my view that it is possible to find excuses for him.\r\n\r\nWe will begin at the time when the subject of the Colonies first showed\r\na tendency to creep menacingly into the daily chit-chat of his Uncle\r\nFrederick.\r\n\r\nJames's Uncle Frederick was always talking more or less about the\r\nColonies, having made a substantial fortune out in Western Australia,\r\nbut it was only when James came down from Oxford that the thing became\r\nreally menacing. Up to that time the uncle had merely spoken of the\r\nColonies _as_ Colonies. Now he began to speak of them with\r\nsinister reference to his nephew. He starred James. It became a case of\r\n'Frederick Knott presents James Datchett in \"The Colonies\",' and there\r\nseemed every prospect that the production would be an early one; for if\r\nthere was one section of the public which Mr Knott disliked more than\r\nanother, it was Young Men Who Ought To Be Out Earning Their Livings\r\nInstead Of Idling At Home. He expressed his views on the subject with\r\nsome eloquence whenever he visited his sister's house. Mrs Datchett was\r\na widow, and since her husband's death had been in the habit of\r\naccepting every utterance of her brother Frederick as a piece of\r\ngenuine all-wool wisdom; though, as a matter of fact, James's uncle had\r\njust about enough brain to make a jay-bird fly crooked, and no more. He\r\nhad made his money through keeping sheep. And any fool can keep sheep.\r\nHowever, he had this reputation for wisdom, and what he said went. It\r\nwas not long, therefore, before it was evident that the ranks of the\r\nY.M.W.O.T.B.O.E.T.L.I.O.I.A.H. were about to lose a member.\r\n\r\nJames, for his part, was all against the Colonies. As a setting for his\r\ncareer, that is to say. He was no Little Englander. He had no earthly\r\nobjection to Great Britain _having Colonies._ By all means have\r\nColonies. They could rely on him for moral support. But when it came to\r\nlegging it out to West Australia to act as a sort of valet to Uncle\r\nFrederick's beastly sheep--no. Not for James. For him the literary\r\nlife. Yes, that was James's dream--to have a stab at the literary life.\r\nAt Oxford he had contributed to the _Isis,_ and since coming down\r\nhad been endeavouring to do the same to the papers of the Metropolis.\r\nHe had had no success so far. But some inward voice seemed to tell\r\nhim--(Read on. Read on. This is no story about the young beginner's\r\nstruggles in London. We do not get within fifty miles of Fleet Street.)\r\n\r\nA temporary compromise was effected between the two parties by the\r\nsecuring for James of a post as assistant-master at Harrow House, the\r\nprivate school of one Blatherwick, M.A., the understanding being that\r\nif he could hold the job he could remain in England and write, if it\r\npleased him, in his spare time. But if he fell short in any way as a\r\nhandler of small boys he was to descend a step in the animal kingdom\r\nand be matched against the West Australian sheep. There was to be no\r\nsecond chance in the event of failure. From the way Uncle Frederick\r\ntalked James almost got the idea that he attached a spiritual\r\nimportance to a connexion with sheep. He seemed to strive with a sort\r\nof religious frenzy to convert James to West Australia. So James went\r\nto Harrow House with much the same emotions that the Old Guard must\r\nhave felt on their way up the hill at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nHarrow House was a grim mansion on the outskirts of Dover. It is\r\nbetter, of course, to be on the outskirts of Dover than actually in\r\nit, but when you have said that you have said everything. James's\r\nimpressions of that portion of his life were made up almost entirely of\r\nchalk. Chalk in the school-room, chalk all over the country-side, chalk\r\nin the milk. In this universe of chalk he taught bored boys the\r\nrudiments of Latin, geography, and arithmetic, and in the evenings,\r\nafter a stately cup of coffee with Mr Blatherwick in his study, went to\r\nhis room and wrote stories. The life had the advantage of offering few\r\ndistractions. Except for Mr Blatherwick and a weird freak who came up\r\nfrom Dover on Tuesdays and Fridays to teach French, he saw nobody.\r\n\r\nIt was about five weeks from the beginning of term that the river of\r\nlife at Harrow House became ruffled for the new assistant-master.\r\n\r\nI want you to follow me very closely here. As far as the excusing of\r\nJames's conduct is concerned, it is now or never. If I fail at this\r\npoint to touch you, I have shot my bolt.\r\n\r\nLet us marshal the facts.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it was a perfectly ripping morning.\r\n\r\nMoreover he had received at breakfast a letter from the editor of a\r\nmonthly magazine accepting a short story.\r\n\r\nThis had never happened to him before.\r\n\r\nHe was twenty-two.\r\n\r\nAnd, just as he rounded the angle of the house, he came upon Violet,\r\ntaking the air like himself.\r\n\r\nViolet was one of the housemaids, a trim, energetic little person with\r\nround blue eyes and a friendly smile. She smiled at James now. James\r\nhalted.\r\n\r\n'Good morning, sir,' said Violet.\r\n\r\nFrom my list of contributory causes I find that I have omitted one\r\nitem--viz., that there did not appear to be anybody else about.\r\n\r\nJames looked meditatively at Violet. Violet looked smilingly at James.\r\nThe morning was just as ripping as it had been a moment before. James\r\nwas still twenty-two. And the editor's letter had not ceased to crackle\r\nin his breast-pocket.\r\n\r\nConsequently James stooped, and--in a purely brotherly way--kissed\r\nViolet.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was wrong. It was no part of James's duties as\r\nassistant-master at Harrow House to wander about bestowing brotherly\r\nkisses on housemaids. On the other hand, there was no great harm done.\r\nIn the circles in which Violet moved the kiss was equivalent to the\r\nhand-shake of loftier society. Everybody who came to the back door\r\nkissed Violet. The carrier did; so did the grocer, the baker, the\r\nbutcher, the gardener, the postman, the policeman, and the fishmonger.\r\nThey were men of widely differing views on most points. On religion,\r\npolitics, and the prospects of the entrants for the three o'clock race\r\ntheir opinions clashed. But in one respect they were unanimous.\r\nWhenever they came to the back door of Harrow House they all kissed\r\nViolet.\r\n\r\n'I've had a story accepted by the _Universal Magazine_,' said\r\nJames, casually.\r\n\r\n'Have you, sir?' said Violet.\r\n\r\n'It's a pretty good magazine. I shall probably do a great deal for it\r\nfrom time to time. The editor seems a decent chap.'\r\n\r\n'Does he, sir?'\r\n\r\n'I shan't tie myself up in any way, of course, unless I get very good\r\nterms. But I shall certainly let him see a good lot of my stuff. Jolly\r\nmorning, isn't it?'\r\n\r\nHe strolled on; and Violet, having sniffed the air for a few more\r\nminutes with her tip-tilted nose, went indoors to attend to her work.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later James, back in the atmosphere of chalk, was writing\r\non the blackboard certain sentences for his class to turn into Latin\r\nprose. A somewhat topical note ran through them. As thus:\r\n\r\n'The uncle of Balbus wished him to tend sheep in the Colonies\r\n(_Provincia_).'\r\n\r\n'Balbus said that England was good enough for him (_placeo_).'\r\n\r\n'Balbus sent a story (versus) to Maecenas, who replied that he hoped to\r\nuse it in due course.'\r\n\r\nHis mind floated away from the classroom when a shrill voice brought\r\nhim back.\r\n\r\n'Sir, please, sir, what does \"due course\" mean?'\r\n\r\nJames reflected. 'Alter it to \"immediately,\"' he said.\r\n\r\n'Balbus is a great man,' he wrote on the blackboard.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later he was in the office of an important magazine, and\r\nthere was a look of relief on the editor's face, for James had\r\npractically promised to do a series of twelve short stories for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been well observed that when a writer has a story rejected he\r\nshould send that story to another editor, but that when he has one\r\naccepted he should send another story to that editor. Acting on this\r\nexcellent plan, James, being off duty for an hour after tea, smoked a\r\npipe in his bedroom and settled down to work on a second effort for the\r\nUniversal.\r\n\r\nHe was getting on rather well when his flow of ideas was broken by a\r\nknock on the door.\r\n\r\n'Come in,' yelled James. (Your author is notoriously irritable.)\r\n\r\nThe new-comer was Adolf. Adolf was one of that numerous band of Swiss\r\nand German youths who come to this country prepared to give their\r\nservices ridiculously cheap in exchange for the opportunity of learning\r\nthe English language. Mr Blatherwick held the view that for a private\r\nschool a male front-door opener was superior to a female, arguing that\r\nthe parents of prospective pupils would be impressed by the sight of a\r\nman in livery. He would have liked something a bit more imposing than\r\nAdolf, but the latter was the showiest thing that could be got for the\r\nmoney, so he made the best of it, and engaged him. After all, an\r\nastigmatic parent, seeing Adolf in a dim light, might be impressed by\r\nhim. You never could tell.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said James, glaring.\r\n\r\n'Anysing vrom dze fillage, sare?'\r\n\r\nThe bulk of Adolf's perquisites consisted of the tips he received for\r\ngoing to the general store down the road for tobacco, stamps, and so\r\non. 'No. Get out,' growled James, turning to his work.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised to find that Adolf, so far from getting out, came in\r\nand shut the door.\r\n\r\n'Zst!' said Adolf, with a finger on his lips.\r\n\r\nJames stared.\r\n\r\n'In dze garten zis morning,' proceeded his visitor, grinning like a\r\ngargoyle, 'I did zee you giss Violed. Zo!'\r\n\r\nJames's heart missed a beat. Considered purely as a situation, his\r\npresent position was not ideal. He had to work hard, and there was not\r\nmuch money attached to the job. But it was what the situation stood for\r\nthat counted. It was his little rock of safety in the midst of a\r\nsurging ocean of West Australian sheep. Once let him lose his grip on\r\nit, and there was no chance for him. He would be swept away beyond hope\r\nof return.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' he said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n'In dze garten. I you vrom a window did zee. You und Violed. Zo!' And\r\nAdolf, in the worst taste, gave a realistic imitation of the scene,\r\nhimself sustaining the role of James.\r\n\r\nJames said nothing. The whole world seemed to be filled with a vast\r\nbaa-ing, as of countless flocks.\r\n\r\n'Lizzun!' said Adolf. 'Berhaps I Herr Blazzervig dell. Berhaps not I\r\ndo. Zo!'\r\n\r\nJames roused himself. At all costs he must placate this worm. Mr\r\nBlatherwick was an austere man. He would not overlook such a crime.\r\n\r\nHe appealed to the other's chivalry.\r\n\r\n'What about Violet?' he said. 'Surely you don't want to lose the poor\r\ngirl her job? They'd be bound to sack her, too.'\r\n\r\nAdolf's eyes gleamed.\r\n\r\n'Zo? Lizzun! When I do gom virst here, I myself do to giss Violed vunce\r\nvish. But she do push dze zide of my face, and my lof is durned to\r\nhate.'\r\n\r\nJames listened attentively to this tabloid tragedy, but made no\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n'Anysing vrom dze fillage, sare?'\r\n\r\nAdolf's voice was meaning. James produced a half-crown.\r\n\r\n'Here you are, then. Get me half a dozen stamps and keep the change.'\r\n\r\n'Zdamps? Yes, sare. At vunce.'\r\n\r\nJames's last impression of the departing one was of a vast and greasy\r\ngrin, stretching most of the way across his face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAdolf, as blackmailer, in which role he now showed himself, differed in\r\nsome respects from the conventional blackmailer of fiction. It may be\r\nthat he was doubtful as to how much James would stand, or it may be\r\nthat his soul as a general rule was above money. At any rate, in actual\r\nspecie he took very little from his victim. He seemed to wish to be\r\nsent to the village oftener than before, but that was all. Half a crown\r\na week would have covered James's financial loss.\r\n\r\nBut he asserted himself in another way. In his most light-hearted\r\nmoments Adolf never forgot the reason which had brought him to England.\r\nHe had come to the country to learn the language, and he meant to do\r\nit. The difficulty which had always handicapped him hitherto--namely,\r\nthe poverty of the vocabularies of those in the servants' quarters--was\r\nnow removed. He appointed James tutor-in-chief of the English language\r\nto himself, and saw that he entered upon his duties at once.\r\n\r\nThe first time that he accosted James in the passage outside the\r\nclassroom, and desired him to explain certain difficult words in a\r\nleading article of yesterday's paper, James was pleased. Adolf, he\r\nthought, regarded the painful episode as closed. He had accepted the\r\nhalf-crown as the full price of silence, and was now endeavouring to be\r\nfriendly in order to make amends.\r\n\r\nThis right-minded conduct gratified James. He felt genially disposed\r\ntoward Adolf. He read the leading article, and proceeded to give a full\r\nand kindly explanation of the hard words. He took trouble over it. He\r\nwent into the derivations of the words. He touched on certain rather\r\ntricky sub-meanings of the same. Adolf went away with any doubts he\r\nmight have had of James's capabilities as a teacher of English\r\ndefinitely scattered. He felt that he had got hold of the right man.\r\n\r\nThere was a shade less geniality in James's manner when the same thing\r\nhappened on the following morning. But he did not refuse to help the\r\nuntutored foreigner. The lecture was less exhaustive than that of the\r\nprevious morning, but we must suppose that it satisfied Adolf, for he\r\ncame again next day, his faith in his teacher undiminished.\r\n\r\nJames was trying to write a story. He turned on the student.\r\n\r\n'Get out!' he howled. 'And take that beastly paper away. Can't you see\r\nI'm busy? Do you think I can spend all my time teaching you to read?\r\nGet out!'\r\n\r\n'Dere some hard vord vos,' said Adolf, patiently, 'of which I gannot\r\ndze meaning.'\r\n\r\nJames briefly cursed the hard word.\r\n\r\n'But,' proceeded Adolf, 'of one vord, of dze vord \"giss\", I dze meaning\r\nknow. Zo!'\r\n\r\nJames looked at him. There was a pause.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later the English lesson was in full swing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll that James had ever heard or read about the wonderful devotion to\r\nstudy of the modern German young man came home to him during the next\r\ntwo weeks. Our English youth fritters away its time in idleness and\r\npleasure-seeking. The German concentrates. Adolf concentrated like a\r\nporous plaster. Every day after breakfast, just when the success of\r\nJames's literary career depended on absolute seclusion, he would come\r\ntrotting up for his lesson. James's writing practically ceased.\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing cannot last. There is a limit, and Adolf reached it\r\nwhen he attempted to add night-classes to the existing curriculum.\r\n\r\nJames, as had been said, was in the habit of taking coffee with Mr\r\nBlatherwick in his study after seeing the boys into bed. It was while\r\nhe was on his way to keep this appointment, a fortnight after his first\r\ninterview with Adolf, that the young student waylaid him with the\r\nevening paper.\r\n\r\nSomething should have warned Adolf that the moment was not well chosen.\r\nTo begin with, James had a headache, the result of a hard day with the\r\nboys. Then that morning's English lesson had caused him to forget\r\nentirely an idea which had promised to be the nucleus of an excellent\r\nplot. And, lastly, passing through the hall but an instant before, he\r\nhad met Violet, carrying the coffee and the evening post to the study,\r\nand she had given him two long envelopes addressed in his own\r\nhandwriting. He was brooding over these, preparatory to opening them,\r\nat the very moment when Adolf addressed him.\r\n\r\n'Eggscuse,' said Adolf, opening the paper.\r\n\r\nJames's eyes gleamed ominously.\r\n\r\n'Zere are here,' continued Adolf, unseeing, 'some beyond-gombarison hard\r\nvords vich I do nod onderstand. For eggsample--'\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that James kicked him.\r\n\r\nAdolf leaped like a stricken chamois.\r\n\r\n'Vot iss?' he cried.\r\n\r\nWith these long envelopes in his hand James cared for nothing. He\r\nkicked Adolf again.\r\n\r\n'Zo!' said the student, having bounded away. He added a few words in\r\nhis native tongue, and proceeded. 'Vait! Lizzun! I zay to you, vait!\r\nBrezendly, ven I haf dze zilver bolished und my odder dudies zo\r\nnumerous berformed, I do Herr Blazzervig vil vith von liddle szdory\r\nvich you do know go. Zo!'\r\n\r\nHe shot off to his lair.\r\n\r\nJames turned away and went down the passage to restore his nervous\r\ntissues with coffee.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the study, leaning against the mantelpiece in moody\r\nreflection, Mr Blatherwick was musing sadly on the hardships of the\r\nschoolmaster's life. The proprietor of Harrow House was a long, grave\r\nman, one of the last to hold out against the anti-whisker crusade. He\r\nhad expressionless hazel eyes, and a general air of being present in\r\nbody but absent in spirit. Mothers who visited the school to introduce\r\ntheir sons put his vagueness down to activity of mind. 'That busy\r\nbrain,' they thought, 'is never at rest. Even while he is talking to\r\nus some abstruse point in the classics is occupying his mind.'\r\n\r\nWhat was occupying his mind at the present moment was the thoroughly\r\nunsatisfactory conduct of his wife's brother, Bertie Baxter. The more\r\ntensely he brooded over the salient points in the life-history of his\r\nwife's brother, Bertie Baxter, the deeper did the iron become embedded\r\nin his soul. Bertie was one of Nature's touchers. This is the age of\r\nthe specialist, Bertie's speciality was borrowing money. He was a man\r\nof almost eerie versatility in this direction. Time could not wither\r\nnor custom stale his infinite variety. He could borrow with a breezy\r\nbluffness which made the thing practically a hold-up. And anon, when\r\nhis victim had steeled himself against this method, he could extract\r\nanother five-pound note from his little hoard with the delicacy of one\r\nplaying spillikins. Mr Blatherwick had been a gold-mine to him for\r\nyears. As a rule, the proprietor of Harrow House unbelted without\r\ncomplaint, for Bertie, as every good borrower should, had that knack of\r\nmaking his victim feel during the actual moment of paying over, as if\r\nhe had just made a rather good investment. But released from the spell\r\nof his brother-in-law's personal magnetism, Mr Blatherwick was apt to\r\nbrood. He was brooding now. Why, he was asking himself morosely, should\r\nhe be harassed by this Bertie? It was not as if Bertie was penniless.\r\nHe had a little income of his own. No, it was pure lack of\r\nconsideration. Who was Bertie that he--\r\n\r\nAt this point in his meditations Violet entered with the after-dinner\r\ncoffee and the evening post.\r\n\r\nMr Blatherwick took the letters. There were two of them, and one he\r\nsaw, with a rush of indignation, was in the handwriting of his\r\nbrother-in-law. Mr Blatherwick's blood simmered. So the fellow thought\r\nhe could borrow by post, did he? Not even trouble to pay a visit, eh?\r\nHe tore the letter open, and the first thing he saw was a cheque for\r\nfive pounds.\r\n\r\nMr Blatherwick was astounded. That a letter from his brother-in-law\r\nshould not contain a request for money was surprising; that it should\r\ncontain a cheque, even for five pounds, was miraculous.\r\n\r\nHe opened the second letter. It was short, but full of the finest,\r\nnoblest sentiments; to wit, that the writer, Charles J. Pickersgill,\r\nhaving heard the school so highly spoken of by his friend, Mr Herbert\r\nBaxter, would be glad if Mr Blatherwick could take in his three sons,\r\naged seven, nine, and eleven respectively, at the earliest convenient\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nMr Blatherwick's first feeling was one of remorse that even in thought\r\nhe should have been harsh to the golden-hearted Bertie. His next was\r\none of elation.\r\n\r\nViolet, meanwhile, stood patiently before him with the coffee. Mr\r\nBlatherwick helped himself. His eye fell on Violet.\r\n\r\nViolet was a friendly, warm-hearted little thing. She saw that Mr\r\nBlatherwick had had good news; and, as the bearer of the letters which\r\nhad contained it, she felt almost responsible. She smiled kindly up at\r\nMr Blatherwick.\r\n\r\nMr Blatherwick's dreamy hazel eye rested pensively upon her. The major\r\nportion of his mind was far away in the future, dealing with visions of\r\na school grown to colossal proportions, and patronized by millionaires.\r\nThe section of it which still worked in the present was just large\r\nenough to enable him to understand that he felt kindly, and even almost\r\ngrateful, to Violet. Unfortunately it was too small to make him see how\r\nwrong it was to kiss her in a vague, fatherly way across the coffee\r\ntray just as James Datchett walked into the room.\r\n\r\nJames paused. Mr Blatherwick coughed. Violet, absolutely unmoved,\r\nsupplied James with coffee, and bustled out of the room.\r\n\r\nShe left behind her a somewhat massive silence.\r\n\r\nMr Blatherwick coughed again.\r\n\r\n'It looks like rain,' said James, carelessly.\r\n\r\n'Ah?' said Mr Blatherwick.\r\n\r\n'Very like rain,' said James.\r\n\r\n'Indeed!' said Mr Blatherwick.\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n'Pity if it rains,' said James.\r\n\r\n'True,' said Mr Blatherwick.\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\n'Er--Datchett,' said Mr Blatherwick.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said James.\r\n\r\n'I--er--feel that perhaps--'\r\n\r\nJames waited attentively.\r\n\r\n'Have you sugar?'\r\n\r\n'Plenty, thanks,' said James.\r\n\r\n'I shall be sorry if it rains,' said Mr Blatherwick.\r\n\r\nConversation languished.\r\n\r\nJames laid his cup down.\r\n\r\n'I have some writing to do,' he said. 'I think I'll be going upstairs\r\nnow.'\r\n\r\n'Er--just so,' said Mr Blatherwick, with relief. 'Just so. An excellent\r\nidea.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Er--Datchett,' said Mr Blatherwick next day, after breakfast.\r\n\r\n'Yes?' said James.\r\n\r\nA feeling of content was over him this morning. The sun had broken\r\nthrough the clouds. One of the long envelopes which he had received on\r\nthe previous night had turned out, on examination, to contain a letter\r\nfrom the editor accepting the story if he would reconstruct certain\r\npassages indicated in the margin.\r\n\r\n'I have--ah--unfortunately been compelled to dismiss Adolf,' said Mr\r\nBlatherwick.\r\n\r\n'Yes?' said James. He had missed Adolf's shining morning face.\r\n\r\n'Yes. After you had left me last night he came to my study with a\r\nmalicious--er--fabrication respecting yourself which I need\r\nnot--ah--particularize.'\r\n\r\nJames looked pained. Awful thing it is, this nourishing vipers in one's\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n'Why, I've been giving Adolf English lessons nearly every day lately.\r\nNo sense of gratitude, these foreigners,' he said, sadly.\r\n\r\n'So I was compelled,' proceeded Mr Blatherwick, 'to--in fact, just so.'\r\n\r\nJames nodded sympathetically.\r\n\r\n'Do you know anything about West Australia?' he asked, changing the\r\nsubject. 'It's a fine country, I believe. I had thought of going there\r\nat one time.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed?' said Mr Blatherwick.\r\n\r\n'But I've given up the idea now,' said James.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE FROM DUNSTERVILLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was erected in Longacre Square, New York, a\r\nlarge white statue, labelled 'Our City', the figure of a woman in\r\nGrecian robes holding aloft a shield. Critical citizens objected to it\r\nfor various reasons, but its real fault was that its symbolism was\r\nfaulty. The sculptor should have represented New York as a conjuror in\r\nevening dress, smiling blandly as he changed a rabbit into a bowl of\r\ngoldfish. For that, above all else, is New York's speciality. It\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nBetween 1 May, when she stepped off the train, and 16 May, when she\r\nreceived Eddy Moore's letter containing the information that he had\r\nfound her a post as stenographer in the office of Joe Rendal, it had\r\nchanged Mary Hill quite remarkably.\r\n\r\nMary was from Dunsterville, which is in Canada. Emigrations from\r\nDunsterville were rare. It is a somnolent town; and, as a rule, young\r\nmen born there follow in their father's footsteps, working on the\r\npaternal farm or helping in the paternal store. Occasionally a daring\r\nspirit will break away, but seldom farther than Montreal. Two only of\r\nthe younger generation, Joe Rendal and Eddy Moore, had set out to make\r\ntheir fortunes in New York; and both, despite the gloomy prophecies of\r\nthe village sages, had prospered.\r\n\r\nMary, third and last emigrant, did not aspire to such heights. All she\r\ndemanded from New York for the present was that it should pay her a\r\nliving wage, and to that end, having studied by stealth typewriting and\r\nshorthand, she had taken the plunge, thrilling with excitement and the\r\nromance of things; and New York had looked at her, raised its eyebrows,\r\nand looked away again. If every city has a voice, New York's at that\r\nmoment had said 'Huh!' This had damped Mary. She saw that there were\r\ngoing to be obstacles. For one thing, she had depended so greatly on\r\nEddy Moore, and he had failed her. Three years before, at a church\r\nfestival, he had stated specifically that he would die for her. Perhaps\r\nhe was still willing to do that--she had not inquired--but, at any\r\nrate, he did not see his way to employing her as a secretary. He had\r\nbeen very nice about it. He had smiled kindly, taken her address, and\r\nsaid he would do what he could, and had then hurried off to meet a man\r\nat lunch. But he had not given her a position. And as the days went by\r\nand she found no employment, and her little stock of money dwindled,\r\nand no word came from Eddy, New York got to work and changed her\r\noutlook on things wonderfully. What had seemed romantic became merely\r\nfrightening. What had been exciting gave her a feeling of dazed\r\nhelplessness.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until Eddy's letter came that she realized the\r\ncompleteness of the change. On 1 May she would have thanked Eddy\r\npolitely for his trouble, adding, however, that she would really prefer\r\nnot to meet poor Joe again. On 16 May she welcomed him as something\r\nHeaven-sent. The fact that she was to be employed outweighed a\r\nthousand-fold the fact that her employer was to be Joe.\r\n\r\nIt was not that she disliked Joe. She was sorry for him.\r\n\r\nShe remembered Joe, a silent, shambling youth, all hands, feet, and\r\nshyness, who had spent most of his spare time twisting his fingers and\r\nstaring adoringly at her from afar. The opinion of those in the social\r\nwhirl of Dunsterville had been that it was his hopeless passion for her\r\nthat had made him fly to New York. It would be embarrassing meeting him\r\nagain. It would require tact to discourage his silent worshipping\r\nwithout wounding him more deeply. She hated hurting people.\r\n\r\nBut, even at the cost of that, she must accept the post. To refuse\r\nmeant ignominious retreat to Dunsterville, and from that her pride\r\nrevolted. She must revisit Dunsterville in triumph or not at all.\r\n\r\nJoe Rendal's office was in the heart of the financial district,\r\nsituated about half-way up a building that, to Mary, reared amidst the\r\nless impressive architecture of her home-town, seemed to reach nearly\r\nto the sky. A proud-looking office-boy, apparently baffled and\r\nmortified by the information that she had an appointment, took her\r\nname, and she sat down, filled with a fine mixed assortment of\r\nemotions, to wait.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since her arrival in New York she felt almost easy\r\nin her mind. New York, with its shoving, jostling, hurrying crowds; a\r\ngiant fowl-run, full of human fowls scurrying to and fro; clucking,\r\never on the look-out for some desired morsel, and ever ready to swoop\r\ndown and snatch it from its temporary possessor, had numbed her. But\r\nnow she felt a slackening of the strain. New York might be too much for\r\nher, but she could cope with Joe.\r\n\r\nThe haughty boy returned. Mr Rendal was disengaged. She rose and went\r\ninto an inner room, where a big man was seated at a desk.\r\n\r\nIt was Joe. There was no doubt about that. But it was not the Joe she\r\nremembered, he of the twisted ringers and silent stare. In his case,\r\nNew York had conjured effectively. He was better-looking, better-dressed,\r\nimproved in every respect. In the old days one had noticed the hands\r\nand feet and deduced the presence of Joe somewhere in the background.\r\nNow they were merely adjuncts. It was with a rush of indignation that\r\nMary found herself bucolic and awkward. Awkward with Joe! It was an\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\nHis manner heightened the feeling. If he had given the least sign of\r\nembarrassment she might have softened towards him. He showed no\r\nembarrassment whatever. He was very much at his ease. He was cheerful.\r\nHe was even flippant.\r\n\r\n'Welcome to our beautiful little city,' he said.\r\n\r\nMary was filled with a helpless anger. What right had he to ignore the\r\npast in this way, to behave as if her presence had never reduced him to\r\npulp?\r\n\r\n'Won't you sit down?' he went on. 'It's splendid, seeing you again,\r\nMary. You're looking very well. How long have you been in New York?\r\nEddy tells me you want to be taken on as a secretary. As it happens,\r\nthere is a vacancy for just that in this office. A big, wide vacancy,\r\nleft by a lady who departed yesterday in a shower of burning words and\r\nhairpins. She said she would never return, and between ourselves, that\r\nwas the right guess. Would you mind letting me see what you can do?\r\nWill you take this letter down?'\r\n\r\nCertainly there was something compelling about this new Joe. Mary took\r\nthe pencil and pad which he offered--and she took them meekly. Until\r\nthis moment she had always been astonished by the reports which\r\nfiltered through to Dunsterville of his success in the big city. Of\r\ncourse, nobody had ever doubted his perseverance; but it takes\r\nsomething more than perseverance to fight New York fairly and squarely,\r\nand win. And Joe had that something. He had force. He was sure of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n'Read it please,' he said, when he had finished dictating. 'Yes, that's\r\nall right. You'll do.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment Mary was on the point of refusing. A mad desire gripped\r\nher to assert herself, to make plain her resentment at this revolt of\r\nthe serf. Then she thought of those scuttling, clucking crowds, and her\r\nheart failed her.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' she said, in a small voice.\r\n\r\nAs she spoke the door opened.\r\n\r\n'Well, well, well!' said Joe. 'Here we all are! Come in, Eddy. Mary\r\nhas just been showing me what she can do.'\r\n\r\nIf time had done much for Joe, it had done more for his fellow-emigrant,\r\nEddy Moore. He had always been good-looking and--according to local\r\nstandards--presentable. Tall, slim, with dark eyes that made you catch\r\nyour breath when they looked into yours, and a ready flow of speech,\r\nhe had been Dunsterville's prize exhibit. And here he was with all his\r\nexcellence heightened and accentuated by the polish of the city. He\r\nhad filled out. His clothes were wonderful. And his voice, when he\r\nspoke, had just that same musical quality.\r\n\r\n'So you and Joe have fixed it up? Capital! Shall we all go and lunch\r\nsomewhere?'\r\n\r\n'Got an appointment,' said Joe. 'I'm late already. Be here at two\r\nsharp, Mary.' He took up his hat and went out.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Eddy's suavity had been to make Mary forget the position\r\nin which she now stood to Joe. Eddy had created for the moment quite an\r\nold-time atmosphere of good fellowship. She hated Joe for shattering\r\nthis and reminding her that she was his employee. Her quick flush was\r\nnot lost on Eddy.\r\n\r\n'Dear old Joe is a little abrupt sometimes,' he said. 'But--'\r\n\r\n'He's a pig!' said Mary, defiantly.\r\n\r\n'But you mustn't mind it. New York makes men like that.'\r\n\r\n'It hasn't made you--not to me, at any rate. Oh, Eddy,' she cried,\r\nimpulsively, 'I'm frightened. I wish I had never come here. You're the\r\nonly thing in this whole city that isn't hateful.'\r\n\r\n'Poor little girl!' he said. 'Never mind. Let me take you and give you\r\nsome lunch. Come along.'\r\n\r\nEddy was soothing. There was no doubt of that. He stayed her with\r\nminced chicken and comforted her with soft shelled crab. His voice was\r\na lullaby, lulling her Joe-harassed nerves to rest.\r\n\r\nThey discussed the dear old days. A carper might have said that Eddy\r\nwas the least bit vague on the subject of the dear old days. A carper\r\nmight have pointed out that the discussion of the dear old days, when\r\nyou came to analyse it, was practically a monologue on Mary's part,\r\npunctuated with musical 'Yes, yes's' from her companion. But who cares\r\nwhat carpers think? Mary herself had no fault to find. In the roar of\r\nNew York Dunsterville had suddenly become very dear to her, and she\r\nfound in Eddy a sympathetic soul to whom she could open her heart.\r\n\r\n'Do you remember the old school, Eddy, and how you and I used to walk\r\nthere together, you carrying my dinner-basket and helping me over\r\nthe fences?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes.'\r\n\r\n'And we'd gather hickory-nuts and persimmons?'\r\n\r\n'Persimmons, yes,' murmured Eddy.\r\n\r\n'Do you remember the prizes the teacher gave the one who got best marks\r\nin the spelling class? And the treats at Christmas, when we all got\r\ntwelve sticks of striped peppermint candy? And drawing the water out of\r\nthe well in that old wooden bucket in the winter, and pouring it out in\r\nthe playground and skating on it when it froze? And wasn't it cold in\r\nthe winter, too! Do you remember the stove in the school-room? How we\r\nused to crowd round it!'\r\n\r\n'The stove, yes,' said Eddy, dreamily. 'Ah, yes, the stove. Yes, yes.\r\nThose were the dear old days!' Mary leaned her elbows on the table and\r\nher chin on her hands, and looked across at him with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Eddy,' she said, 'you don't know how nice it is to meet someone\r\nwho remembers all about those old times! I felt a hundred million miles\r\nfrom Dunsterville before I saw you, and I was homesick. But now it's\r\nall different.'\r\n\r\n'Poor little Mary!'\r\n\r\n'Do you remember--?'\r\n\r\nHe glanced at his watch with some haste.\r\n\r\n'It's two o'clock,' he said. 'I think we should be going.'\r\n\r\nMary's face fell.\r\n\r\n'Back to that pig, Joe! I hate him. And I'll show him that I do!'\r\n\r\nEddy looked almost alarmed.\r\n\r\n'I--I shouldn't do that,' he said. 'I don't think I should do that.\r\nIt's only his manner at first. You'll get to like him better. He's an\r\nawfully good fellow really, Joe. And if you--er--quarrelled with him\r\nyou might find it hard--what I mean is, it's not so easy to pick up\r\njobs in New York, I shouldn't like to think of you, Mary,' he added,\r\ntenderly, 'hunting for a job--tired--perhaps hungry--'\r\n\r\nMary's eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n'How good you are, Eddy!' she said. 'And I'm horrid, grumbling when I\r\nought to be thanking you for getting me the place. I'll be nice to\r\nhim--if I can--as nice as I can.'\r\n\r\n'That's right. Do try. And we shall be seeing quite a lot of each\r\nother. We must often lunch together.'\r\n\r\nMary re-entered the office not without some trepidation. Two hours ago\r\nit would have seemed absurd to be frightened of Joe, but Eddy had\r\nbrought it home to her again how completely she was dependent on her\r\nformer serf's good-will. And he had told her to be back at two sharp,\r\nand it was now nearly a quarter past.\r\n\r\nThe outer office was empty. She went on into the inner room.\r\n\r\nShe had speculated as she went on Joe's probable attitude. She had\r\npictured him as annoyed, even rude. What she was not prepared for was\r\nto find him on all fours, grunting and rooting about in a pile of\r\npapers. She stopped short.\r\n\r\n'What _are_ you doing?' she gasped.\r\n\r\n'I can't think what you meant,' he said. 'There must be some mistake.\r\nI'm not even a passable pig. I couldn't deceive a novice.'\r\n\r\nHe rose and dusted his knees.\r\n\r\n'Yet you seemed absolutely certain in the restaurant just now. Did you\r\nnotice that you were sitting near to a sort of jungle of potted palms?\r\nI was lunching immediately on the other side of the forest.'\r\n\r\nMary drew herself up and fixed him with an eye that shone with rage and\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n'Eavesdropper!' she cried.\r\n\r\n'Not guilty,' he said, cheerfully. 'I hadn't a notion that you were\r\nthere till you shouted, \"That pig Joe, I hate him!\" and almost directly\r\nafterwards I left.'\r\n\r\n'I did not shout.'\r\n\r\n'My dear girl, you cracked a wine-glass at my table. The man I was\r\nlunching with jumped clean out of his seat and swallowed his cigar. You\r\nought to be more careful!'\r\n\r\nMary bit her lip.\r\n\r\n'And now, I suppose, you are going to dismiss me?'\r\n\r\n'Dismiss you? Not much. The thing has simply confirmed my high opinion\r\nof your qualifications. The ideal secretary must have two qualities:\r\nshe must be able to sec. and she must think her employer a pig. You\r\nfill the bill. Would you mind taking down this letter?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLife was very swift and stimulating for Mary during the early days of\r\nher professional career. The inner workings of a busy broker's office\r\nare always interesting to the stranger. She had never understood how\r\nbusiness men made their money, and she did not understand now; but it\r\ndid not take her long to see that if they were all like Joe Rendal they\r\nearned it. There were days of comparative calm. There were days that\r\nwere busy. And there were days that packed into the space of a few\r\nhours the concentrated essence of a music-hall knock-about sketch, an\r\nearthquake, a football scrummage, and the rush-hour on the Tube; when\r\nthe office was full of shouting men, when strange figures dived in and\r\nout and banged doors like characters in an old farce, and Harold, the\r\nproud office-boy, lost his air of being on the point of lunching with a\r\nduke at the club and perspired like one of the proletariat. On these\r\noccasions you could not help admiring Joe, even if you hated him. When\r\na man is doing his own job well, it is impossible not to admire him.\r\nAnd Joe did his job well, superlatively well. He was everywhere. Where\r\nothers trotted, he sprang. Where others raised their voices, he yelled.\r\nWhere others were in two places at once, he was in three and moving\r\ntowards a fourth.\r\n\r\nThese upheavals had the effect on Mary of making her feel curiously\r\nlinked to the firm. On ordinary days work was work, but on these\r\noccasions of storm and stress it was a fight, and she looked on every\r\nmember of the little band grouped under the banner of J. Rendal as a\r\nbrother-in-arms. For Joe, while the battle raged, she would have done\r\nanything. Her resentment at being under his orders vanished completely.\r\nHe was her captain, and she a mere unit in the firing line. It was a\r\nprivilege to do what she was told. And if the order came sharp and\r\nabrupt, that only meant that the fighting was fierce and that she was\r\nall the more fortunate in being in a position to be of service.\r\n\r\nThe reaction would come with the end of the fight. Her private\r\nhostilities began when the firm's ceased. She became an ordinary\r\nindividual again, and so did Joe. And to Joe, as an ordinary\r\nindividual, she objected. There was an indefinable something in his\r\nmanner which jarred on her. She came to the conclusion that it was\r\nprincipally his insufferable good-humour. If only he would lose his\r\ntemper with her now and then, she felt he would be bearable. He lost it\r\nwith others. Why not with her? Because, she told herself bitterly, he\r\nwanted to show her that she mattered so little to him that it was not\r\nworth while quarrelling with her; because he wanted to put her in the\r\nwrong, to be superior. She had a perfect right to hate a man who\r\ntreated her in that way.\r\n\r\nShe compared him, to his disadvantage, with Eddy. Eddy, during these\r\ndays, continued to be more and more of a comfort. It rather surprised\r\nher that he found so much time to devote to her. When she had first\r\ncalled on him, on her arrival in the city, he had given her the\r\nimpression--more, she admitted, by his manner than his words--that she\r\nwas not wanted. He had shown no disposition to seek her company. But\r\nnow he seemed always to be on hand. To take her out to lunch appeared\r\nto be his chief hobby.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Joe commented on it, with that air of suppressing an\r\nindulgent smile which Mary found so trying.\r\n\r\n'I saw you and Eddy at Stephano's just now,' he said, between sentences\r\nof a letter which he was dictating. 'You're seeing a great deal of\r\nEddy, aren't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Mary. 'He's very kind. He knows I'm lonely.' She paused.\r\n'_He_ hasn't forgotten the old days,' she said, defiantly.\r\n\r\nJoe nodded.\r\n\r\n'Good old Eddy!' he said.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the words to make Mary fire up, but much in the\r\nway they were spoken, and she fired up accordingly.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' she cried.\r\n\r\n'Mean?' queried Joe.\r\n\r\n'You're hinting at something. If you have anything to say against Eddy,\r\nwhy don't you say it straight out?'\r\n\r\n'It's a good working rule in life never to say anything straight out.\r\nSpeaking in parables, I will observe that, if America was a monarchy\r\ninstead of a republic and people here had titles, Eddy would be a\r\ncertainty for first Earl of Pearl Street.'\r\n\r\nDignity fought with curiosity in Mary for a moment. The latter won.\r\n\r\n'I don't know what you mean! Why Pearl Street?'\r\n\r\n'Go and have a look at it.'\r\n\r\nDignity recovered its ground. Mary tossed her head.\r\n\r\n'We are wasting a great deal of time,' she said, coldly. 'Shall I take\r\ndown the rest of this letter?'\r\n\r\n'Great idea!' said Joe, indulgently. 'Do.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA policeman, brooding on life in the neighbourhood of City Hall Park\r\nand Broadway that evening, awoke with a start from his meditations to\r\nfind himself being addressed by a young lady. The young lady had large\r\ngrey eyes and a slim figure. She appealed to the aesthetic taste of the\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\n'Hold to me, lady,' he said, with gallant alacrity. 'I'll see yez\r\nacrost.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, I don't want to cross,' she said. 'Officer!'\r\n\r\nThe policeman rather liked being called 'Officer'.\r\n\r\n'Ma'am?' he beamed.\r\n\r\n'Officer, do you know a street called Pearl Street?'\r\n\r\n'I do that, ma'am.'\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. 'What sort of street is it?'\r\n\r\nThe policeman searched in his mind for a neat definition.\r\n\r\n'Darned crooked, miss,' he said.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to point the way, but the lady had gone.\r\n\r\nIt was a bomb in a blue dress that Joe found waiting for him at the\r\noffice next morning. He surveyed it in silence, then raised his hands\r\nover his head.\r\n\r\n'Don't shoot,' he said. 'What's the matter?'\r\n\r\n'What right had you to say that about Eddy? You know what I mean--about\r\nPearl Street.'\r\n\r\nJoe laughed.\r\n\r\n'Did you take a look at Pearl Street?'\r\n\r\nMary's anger blazed out.\r\n\r\n'I didn't think you could be so mean and cowardly,' she cried. 'You\r\nought to be ashamed to talk about people behind their backs,\r\nwhen--when--besides, if he's what you say, how did it happen that\r\nyou engaged me on his recommendation?'\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for an instant without replying. 'I'd have engaged\r\nyou,' he said, 'on the recommendation of a syndicate of forgers and\r\nthree-card-trick men.'\r\n\r\nHe stood fingering a pile of papers on the desk.\r\n\r\n'Eddy isn't the only person who remembers the old days, Mary,' he said\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, surprised. There was a note in his voice that she\r\nhad not heard before. She was conscious of a curious embarrassment and\r\na subtler feeling which she could not analyse. But before she could\r\nspeak, Harold, the office-boy, entered the room with a card, and the\r\nconversation was swept away on a tidal wave of work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoe made no attempt to resume it. That morning happened to be one of\r\nthe earthquake, knock-about-sketch mornings, and conversation, what\r\nthere was of it, consisted of brief, strenuous remarks of a purely\r\nbusiness nature.\r\n\r\nBut at intervals during the day Mary found herself returning to his\r\nwords. Their effect on her mind puzzled her. It seemed to her that\r\nsomehow they caused things to alter their perspective. In some way Joe\r\nhad become more human. She still refused to believe that Eddy was not\r\nall that was chivalrous and noble, but her anger against Joe for his\r\ninsinuations had given way to a feeling of regret that he should have\r\nmade them. She ceased to look on him as something wantonly malevolent,\r\na Thersites recklessly slandering his betters. She felt that there must\r\nhave been a misunderstanding somewhere and was sorry for it.\r\n\r\nThinking it over, she made up her mind that it was for her to remove\r\nthis misunderstanding. The days which followed strengthened the\r\ndecision; for the improvement in Joe was steadily maintained. The\r\nindefinable something in his manner which had so irritated her had\r\nvanished. It had been, when it had existed, so nebulous that words were\r\nnot needed to eliminate it. Indeed, even now she could not say exactly\r\nin what it had consisted. She only knew that the atmosphere had\r\nchanged. Without a word spoken on either side it seemed that peace had\r\nbeen established between them, and it amazed her what a difference it\r\nmade. She was soothed and happy, and kindly disposed to all men, and\r\nevery day felt more strongly the necessity of convincing Joe and Eddy\r\nof each other's merits, or, rather, of convincing Joe, for Eddy, she\r\nadmitted, always spoke most generously of the other.\r\n\r\nFor a week Eddy did not appear at the office. On the eighth day,\r\nhowever, he rang her up on the telephone, and invited her to lunch.\r\n\r\nLater in the morning Joe happened to ask her out to lunch.\r\n\r\n'I'm so sorry,' said Mary; 'I've just promised Eddy. He wants me to\r\nmeet him at Stephano's, but--' She hesitated. 'Why shouldn't we all\r\nlunch together?' she went on, impulsively.\r\n\r\nShe hurried on. This was her opening, but she felt nervous. The subject\r\nof Eddy had not come up between them since that memorable conversation\r\na week before, and she was uncertain of her ground.\r\n\r\n'I wish you liked Eddy, Joe,' she said. 'He's very fond of you, and it\r\nseems such a shame that--I mean--we're all from the same old town,\r\nand--oh, I know I put it badly, but--'\r\n\r\n'I think you put it very well,' said Joe; 'and if I could like a man to\r\norder I'd do it to oblige you. But--well, I'm not going to keep harping\r\non it. Perhaps you'll see through Eddy yourself one of these days.'\r\n\r\nA sense of the hopelessness of her task oppressed Mary. She put on her\r\nhat without replying, and turned to go.\r\n\r\nAt the door some impulse caused her to glance back, and as she did so\r\nshe met his eye, and stood staring. He was looking at her as she had so\r\noften seen him look three years before in Dunsterville--humbly,\r\nappealingly, hungrily.\r\n\r\nHe took a step forward. A sort of panic seized her. Her fingers were on\r\nthe door-handle. She turned it, and the next moment was outside.\r\n\r\nShe walked slowly down the street. She felt shaken. She had believed so\r\nthoroughly that his love for her had vanished with his shyness and\r\nawkwardness in the struggle for success in New York. His words, his\r\nmanner--everything had pointed to that. And now--it was as if those\r\nthree years had not been. Nothing had altered, unless it were--herself.\r\n\r\nHad she altered? Her mind was in a whirl. This thing had affected her like\r\nsome physical shock. The crowds and noises of the street bewildered her.\r\nIf only she could get away from them and think quietly--\r\n\r\nAnd then she heard her name spoken, and looked round, to see Eddy.\r\n\r\n'Glad you could come,' he said. 'I've something I want to talk to you\r\nabout. It'll be quiet at Stephano's.'\r\n\r\nShe noticed, almost unconsciously, that he seemed nervous. He was\r\nunwontedly silent. She was glad of it. It helped her to think.\r\n\r\nHe gave the waiter an order, and became silent again, drumming with\r\nhis fingers on the cloth. He hardly spoke till the meal was over and\r\nthe coffee was on the table. Then he leant forward.\r\n\r\n'Mary,' he said, 'we've always been pretty good friends, haven't we?'\r\n\r\nHis dark eyes were looking into hers. There was an expression in them\r\nthat was strange to her. He smiled, but it seemed to Mary that there\r\nwas effort behind the smile.\r\n\r\n'Of course we have, Eddy,' she said. He touched her hand.\r\n\r\n'Dear little Mary!' he said, softly.\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n'Mary,' he went on, 'you would like to do me a good turn? You would,\r\nwouldn't you, Mary?'\r\n\r\n'Why, Eddy, of course!'\r\n\r\nHe touched her hand again. This time, somehow, the action grated on\r\nher. Before, it had seemed impulsive, a mere spontaneous evidence\r\nof friendship. Now there was a suggestion of artificiality,--of\r\ncalculation. She drew back a little in her chair. Deep down in her\r\nsome watchful instinct had sounded an alarm. She was on guard.\r\n\r\nHe drew in a quick breath.\r\n\r\n'It's nothing much. Nothing at all. It's only this. I--I--Joe will be\r\nwriting a letter to a man called Weston on Thursday--Thursday\r\nremember. There won't be anything in it--nothing of importance--nothing\r\nprivate--but--I--I want you to mail me a copy of it, Mary. A--a copy\r\nof--'\r\n\r\nShe was looking at him open-eyed. Her face was white and shocked.\r\n\r\n'For goodness' sake,' he said, irritably, 'don't look like that. I'm\r\nnot asking you to commit murder. What's the matter with you? Look here,\r\nMary; you'll admit you owe me something, I suppose? I'm the only man in\r\nNew York that's ever done anything for you. Didn't I get you your job?\r\nWell, then, it's not as if I were asking you to do anything dangerous,\r\nor difficult, or--'\r\n\r\nShe tried to speak, but could not. He went on rapidly. He did not look\r\nat her. His eyes wandered past her, shifting restlessly.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said; 'I'll be square with you. You're in New York to\r\nmake money. Well, you aren't going to make it hammering a typewriter.\r\nI'm giving you your chance. I'm going to be square with you. Let me see\r\nthat letter, and--'\r\n\r\nHis voice died away abruptly. The expression on his face changed. He\r\nsmiled, and this time the effort was obvious.\r\n\r\n'Halloa, Joe!' he said.\r\n\r\nMary turned. Joe was standing at her side. He looked very large and\r\nwholesome and restful.\r\n\r\n'I don't want to intrude,' he said; 'but I wanted to see you, Eddy, and\r\nI thought I should catch you here. I wrote a letter to Jack Weston\r\nyesterday--after I got home from the office--and one to you; and\r\nsomehow I managed to post them in the wrong envelopes. It doesn't\r\nmatter much, because they both said the same thing.'\r\n\r\n'The same thing?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I told you I should be writing to you again on Thursday, to tip\r\nyou something good that I was expecting from old Longwood. Jack Weston\r\nhas just rung me up on the 'phone to say that he got a letter that\r\ndoesn't belong to him. I explained to him and thought I'd drop in here\r\nand explain to you. Why, what's your hurry, Eddy?'\r\n\r\nEddy had risen from his seat.\r\n\r\n'I'm due back at the office,' he said, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n'Busy man! I'm having a slack day. Well, good-bye. I'll see Mary back.'\r\n\r\nJoe seated himself in the vacant chair.\r\n\r\n'You're looking tired,' he said. 'Did Eddy talk too much?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he did ... Joe, you were right.'\r\n\r\n'Ah--Mary!' Joe chuckled. 'I'll tell you something I didn't tell Eddy.\r\nIt wasn't entirely through carelessness that I posted those letters in\r\nthe wrong envelopes. In fact, to be absolutely frank, it wasn't through\r\ncarelessness at all. There's an old gentleman in Pittsburgh by the name\r\nof John Longwood, who occasionally is good enough to inform me of some\r\nof his intended doings on the market a day or so before the rest of the\r\nworld knows them, and Eddy has always shown a strong desire to get\r\nearly information too. Do you remember my telling you that your\r\npredecessor at the office left a little abruptly? There was a reason. I\r\nengaged her as a confidential secretary, and she overdid it. She\r\nconfided in Eddy. From the look on your face as I came in I gathered\r\nthat he had just been proposing that you should perform a similar act\r\nof Christian charity. Had he?'\r\n\r\nMary clenched her hands.\r\n\r\n'It's this awful New York!' she cried. 'Eddy was never like that in\r\nDunsterville.'\r\n\r\n'Dunsterville does not offer quite the same scope,' said Joe.\r\n\r\n'New York changes everything,' Mary returned. 'It has changed Eddy--it\r\nhas changed you.'\r\n\r\nHe bent towards her and lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n'Not altogether,' he said. 'I'm just the same in one way. I've tried to\r\npretend I had altered, but it's no use. I give it up. I'm still just\r\nthe same poor fool who used to hang round staring at you in\r\nDunsterville.'\r\n\r\nA waiter was approaching the table with the air, which waiters\r\ncultivate, of just happening by chance to be going in that direction.\r\nJoe leaned farther forward, speaking quickly.\r\n\r\n'And for whom,' he said, 'you didn't care a single, solitary snap of\r\nyour fingers, Mary.'\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him. The waiter hovered, poising for his swoop.\r\nSuddenly she smiled.\r\n\r\n'New York has changed me too, Joe,' she said.\r\n\r\n'Mary!' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Ze pill, sare,' observed the waiter.\r\n\r\nJoe turned.\r\n\r\n'Ze what!' he exclaimed. 'Well, I'm hanged! Eddy's gone off and left me\r\nto pay for his lunch! That man's a wonder! When it comes to brain-work,\r\nhe's in a class by himself.' He paused. 'But I have the luck,' he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUPPENNY MILLIONAIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the crowd that strolled on the Promenade des Etrangers, enjoying the\r\nmorning sunshine, there were some who had come to Roville for their\r\nhealth, others who wished to avoid the rigours of the English spring,\r\nand many more who liked the place because it was cheap and close to\r\nMonte Carlo.\r\n\r\nNone of these motives had brought George Albert Balmer. He was there\r\nbecause, three weeks before, Harold Flower had called him a vegetable.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that makes men do perilous deeds? Why does a man go over\r\nNiagara Falls in a barrel? Not for his health. Half an hour with a\r\nskipping-rope would be equally beneficial to his liver. No; in nine\r\ncases out of ten he does it to prove to his friends and relations that\r\nhe is not the mild, steady-going person they have always thought him.\r\nObserve the music-hall acrobat as he prepares to swing from the roof by\r\nhis eyelids. His gaze sweeps the house. 'It isn't true,' it seems to\r\nsay. 'I'm not a jelly-fish.'\r\n\r\nIt was so with George Balmer.\r\n\r\nIn London at the present moment there exist some thousands of\r\nrespectable, neatly-dressed, mechanical, unenterprising young men,\r\nemployed at modest salaries by various banks, corporations, stores,\r\nshops, and business firms. They are put to work when young, and they\r\nstay put. They are mussels. Each has his special place on the rock, and\r\nremains glued to it all his life.\r\n\r\nTo these thousands George Albert Balmer belonged. He differed in no\r\ndetail from the rest of the great army. He was as respectable, as\r\nneatly-dressed, as mechanical, and as unenterprising. His life was\r\nbounded, east, west, north, and south, by the Planet Insurance Company,\r\nwhich employed him; and that there were other ways in which a man might\r\nfulfil himself than by giving daily imitations behind a counter of a\r\nmechanical figure walking in its sleep had never seriously crossed his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nOn George, at the age of twenty-four, there descended, out of a dear\r\nsky, a legacy of a thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nPhysically, he remained unchanged beneath the shock. No trace of hauteur\r\ncrept into his bearing. When the head of his department, calling his\r\nattention to a technical flaw in his work of the previous afternoon,\r\naddressed him as 'Here, you--young what's-your-confounded-name!' he\r\ndid not point out that this was no way to speak to a gentleman of\r\nproperty. You would have said that the sudden smile of Fortune had\r\nfailed to unsettle him.\r\n\r\nBut all the while his mind, knocked head over heels, was lying in a\r\nlimp heap, wondering what had struck it.\r\n\r\nTo him, in his dazed state, came Harold Flower. Harold, messenger to the\r\nPlanet Insurance Company and one of the most assiduous money-borrowers\r\nin London, had listened to the office gossip about the legacy as if to\r\nthe strains of some grand, sweet anthem. He was a bibulous individual\r\nof uncertain age, who, in the intervals of creeping about his duties,\r\nkept an eye open for possible additions to his staff of creditors. Most\r\nof the clerks at the Planet had been laid under contribution by him in\r\ntheir time, for Harold had a way with him that was good for threepence\r\nany pay-day, and it seemed to him that things had come to a sorry pass\r\nif he could not extract something special from Plutocrat Balmer in his\r\nhour of rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThroughout the day he shadowed George, and, shortly before closing-time,\r\nbacked him into a corner, tapped him on the chest, and requested the\r\ntemporary loan of a sovereign.\r\n\r\nIn the same breath he told him that he was a gentleman, that a\r\nmessenger's life was practically that of a blanky slave, and that a\r\nyoung man of spirit who wished to add to his already large fortune\r\nwould have a bit on Giant Gooseberry for the City and Suburban. He then\r\npaused for a reply.\r\n\r\nNow, all through the day George had been assailed by a steady stream of\r\ndetermined ear-biters. Again and again he had been staked out as an\r\nore-producing claim by men whom it would have been impolitic to rebuff.\r\nHe was tired of lending, and in a mood to resent unauthorized demands.\r\nHarold Flower's struck him as particularly unauthorized. He said so.\r\n\r\nIt took some little time to convince Mr Flower that he really meant it,\r\nbut, realizing at last the grim truth, he drew a long breath and spoke.\r\n\r\n'Ho!' he said. 'Afraid you can't spare it, can't you? A gentleman comes\r\nand asks you with tack and civility for a temp'y loan of about 'arf\r\nnothing, and all you do is to curse and swear at him. Do you know what\r\nI call you--you and your thousand quid? A tuppenny millionaire, that's\r\nwhat I call you. Keep your blooming money. That's all I ask.\r\n_Keep_ it. Much good you'll get out of it. I know your sort.\r\nYou'll never have any pleasure of it. Not you. You're the careful sort.\r\nYou'll put it into Consols, _you_ will, and draw your three-ha'pence\r\na year. Money wasn't meant for your kind. It don't _mean_ nothing\r\nto you. You ain't got the go in you to appreciate it. A vegetable--that's\r\nall you are. A blanky little vegetable. A blanky little gor-blimey\r\nvegetable. I seen turnips with more spirit in 'em that what you've got.\r\nAnd Brussels sprouts. Yes, _and_ parsnips.'\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to walk away with dignity when a man with a hoarse\r\nvoice and a watery eye is comparing you to your disadvantage with a\r\nparsnip, and George did not come anywhere near achieving the feat. But\r\nhe extricated himself somehow, and went home brooding.\r\n\r\nMr Flower's remarks rankled particularly because it so happened that\r\nConsols were the identical investment on which he had decided. His\r\nUncle Robert, with whom he lived as a paying guest, had strongly\r\nadvocated them. Also they had suggested themselves to him\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\nBut Harold Flower's words gave him pause. They made him think. For two\r\nweeks and some days he thought, flushing uncomfortably whenever he met\r\nthat watery but contemptuous eye. And then came the day of his annual\r\nvacation, and with it inspiration. He sought out the messenger, whom\r\ntill now he had carefully avoided.\r\n\r\n'Er--Flower,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Me lord?'\r\n\r\n'I am taking my holiday tomorrow. Will you forward my letters? I will\r\nwire you the address. I have not settled on my hotel yet. I am popping\r\nover'--he paused--'I am popping over,' he resumed, carelessly, 'to\r\nMonte.'\r\n\r\n'To who?' inquired Mr Flower.\r\n\r\n'To Monte. Monte Carlo, you know.'\r\n\r\nMr Flower blinked twice rapidly, then pulled himself together.\r\n\r\n'Yus, I _don't_ think!' he said.\r\n\r\nAnd that settled it.\r\n\r\nThe George who strolled that pleasant morning on the Promenade des\r\nStrangers differed both externally and internally from the George who\r\nhad fallen out with Harold Flower in the offices of the Planet\r\nInsurance Company. For a day after his arrival he had clung to the garb\r\nof middle-class England. On the second he had discovered that this was\r\nunpleasantly warm and, worse, conspicuous. At the Casino Municipale\r\nthat evening he had observed a man wearing an arrangement in bright\r\nyellow velvet without attracting attention. The sight had impressed\r\nhim. Next morning he had emerged from his hotel in a flannel suit so\r\nlight that it had been unanimously condemned as impossible by his Uncle\r\nRobert, his Aunt Louisa, his Cousins Percy, Eva, and Geraldine, and his\r\nAunt Louisa's mother, and at a shop in the Rue Lasalle had spent twenty\r\nfrancs on a Homburg hat. And Roville had taken it without blinking.\r\n\r\nInternally his alteration had been even more considerable. Roville was\r\nnot Monte Carlo (in which gay spot he had remained only long enough to\r\nsend a picture post-card to Harold Flower before retiring down the\r\ncoast to find something cheaper), but it had been a revelation to him.\r\nFor the first time in his life he was seeing colour, and it intoxicated\r\nhim. The silky blueness of the sea was startling. The pure white of the\r\ngreat hotels along the promenade and the Casino Municipale fascinated\r\nhim. He was dazzled. At the Casino the pillars were crimson and cream,\r\nthe tables sky-blue and pink. Seated on a green-and-white striped chair\r\nhe watched a _revue_, of which from start to finish he understood\r\nbut one word--'out', to wit--absorbed in the doings of a red-moustached\r\ngentleman in blue who wrangled in rapid French with a black-moustached\r\ngentleman in yellow, while a snow-white _commere_ and a _compere_\r\nin a mauve flannel suit looked on at the brawl.\r\n\r\nIt was during that evening that there flitted across his mind the first\r\nsuspicion he had ever had that his Uncle Robert's mental outlook was a\r\nlittle limited.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as he paced the promenade, watching the stir and bustle of the\r\ncrowd, he definitely condemned his absent relative as a narrow-minded\r\nchump.\r\n\r\nIf the brown boots which he had polished so assiduously in his bedroom\r\nthat morning with the inside of a banana-skin, and which now gleamed\r\nfor the first time on his feet, had a fault, it was that they were a\r\nshade tight. To promenade with the gay crowd, therefore, for any length\r\nof time was injudicious; and George, warned by a red-hot shooting\r\nsensation that the moment had arrived for rest, sank down gracefully on\r\na seat, to rise at once on discovering that between him and it was\r\nsomething oblong with sharp corners.\r\n\r\nIt was a book--a fat new novel. George drew it out and inspected it.\r\nThere was a name inside--Julia Waveney.\r\n\r\nGeorge, from boyhood up, had been raised in that school of thought\r\nwhose watchword is 'Findings are keepings', and, having ascertained\r\nthat there was no address attached to the name, he was on the point, I\r\nregret to say, of pouching the volume, which already he looked upon as\r\nhis own, when a figure detached itself from the crowd, and he found\r\nhimself gazing into a pair of grey and, to his startled conscience,\r\naccusing eyes.\r\n\r\n'Oh, thank you! I was afraid it was lost.'\r\n\r\nShe was breathing quickly, and there was a slight flush on her face.\r\nShe took the book from George's unresisting hand and rewarded him with\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n'I missed it, and I couldn't think where I could have left it. Then I\r\nremembered that I had been sitting here. Thank you so much.'\r\n\r\nShe smiled again, turned, and walked away, leaving George to reckon up\r\nall the social solecisms he had contrived to commit in the space of a\r\nsingle moment. He had remained seated, he reminded himself, throughout\r\nthe interview; one. He had not raised his hat, that fascinating Homburg\r\nsimply made to be raised with a debonair swish under such conditions;\r\ntwo. Call it three, because he ought to have raised it twice. He had\r\ngaped like a fool; four. And, five, he had not uttered a single word of\r\nacknowledgement in reply to her thanks.\r\n\r\nFive vast bloomers in under a minute! What could she have thought of\r\nhim? The sun ceased to shine. What sort of an utter outsider could she\r\nhave considered him? An east wind sprang up. What kind of a Cockney\r\nbounder and cad could she have taken him for? The sea turned to an oily\r\ngrey; and George, rising, strode back in the direction of his hotel in\r\na mood that made him forget that he had brown boots on at all.\r\n\r\nHis mind was active. Several times since he had come to Roville he had\r\nbeen conscious of a sensation which he could not understand, a vague,\r\nyearning sensation, a feeling that, splendid as everything was in this\r\nparadise of colour, there was nevertheless something lacking. Now he\r\nunderstood. You had to be in love to get the full flavour of these\r\nvivid whites and blues. He was getting it now. His mood of dejection\r\nhad passed swiftly, to be succeeded by an exhilaration such as he had\r\nonly felt once in his life before, about half-way through a dinner\r\ngiven to the Planet staff on a princely scale by a retiring general\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nHe was exalted. Nothing seemed impossible to him. He would meet the\r\ngirl again on the promenade, he told himself, dashingly renew the\r\nacquaintance, show her that he was not the gaping idiot he had\r\nappeared. His imagination donned its seven-league boots. He saw himself\r\nproposing--eloquently--accepted, married, living happily ever after.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that an excellent first move would be to find out\r\nwhere she was staying. He bought a paper and turned to the list of\r\nvisitors. Miss Waveney. Where was it. He ran his eye down the column.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with a crash, down came his air-castles in hideous ruin.\r\n\r\n'Hotel Cercle de la Mediterranee. Lord Frederick Weston. The Countess\r\nof Southborne and the Hon. Adelaide Liss. Lady Julia Waveney--'\r\n\r\nHe dropped the paper and hobbled on to his hotel. His boots had begun\r\nto hurt him again, for he no longer walked on air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Roville there are several institutions provided by the municipality\r\nfor the purpose of enabling visitors temporarily to kill thought. Chief\r\namong these is the Casino Municipale, where, for a price, the sorrowful\r\nmay obtain oblivion by means of the ingenious game of _boule_.\r\nDisappointed lovers at Roville take to _boule_ as in other places\r\nthey might take to drink. It is a fascinating game. A wooden-faced high\r\npriest flicks a red india-rubber ball into a polished oaken bowl, at\r\nthe bottom of which are holes, each bearing a number up to nine. The\r\nball swings round and round like a planet, slows down, stumbles among\r\nthe holes, rests for a moment in the one which you have backed, then\r\nhops into the next one, and you lose. If ever there was a pastime\r\ncalculated to place young Adam Cupid in the background, this is it.\r\n\r\nTo the _boule_ tables that night fled George with his hopeless\r\npassion. From the instant when he read the fatal words in the paper he\r\nhad recognized its hopelessness. All other obstacles he had been\r\nprepared to overcome, but a title--no. He had no illusions as to his\r\nplace in the social scale. The Lady Julias of this world did not marry\r\ninsurance clerks, even if their late mother's cousin had left them a\r\nthousand pounds. That day-dream was definitely ended. It was a thing of\r\nthe past--all over except the heartache.\r\n\r\nBy way of a preliminary sip of the waters of Lethe, before beginning\r\nthe full draught, he placed a franc on number seven and lost. Another\r\nfranc on six suffered the same fate. He threw a five-franc cart-wheel\r\nrecklessly on evens. It won.\r\n\r\nIt was enough. Thrusting his hat on the back of his head and wedging\r\nhimself firmly against the table, he settled down to make a night of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like _boule_ for absorbing the mind. It was some\r\ntime before George became aware that a hand was prodding him in the\r\nribs. He turned, irritated. Immediately behind him, filling the\r\nlandscape, were two stout Frenchmen. But, even as he searched his brain\r\nfor words that would convey to them in their native tongue his\r\ndisapproval of this jostling, he perceived that they, though stout and\r\nin a general way offensive, were in this particular respect guiltless.\r\nThe prodding hand belonged to somebody invisible behind them. It was\r\nsmall and gloved, a woman's hand. It held a five-franc piece.\r\n\r\nThen in a gap, caused by a movement in the crowd, he saw the face of\r\nLady Julia Waveney.\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him.\r\n\r\n'On eight, please, would you mind?' he heard her say, and then the\r\ncrowd shifted again and she disappeared, leaving him holding the coin,\r\nhis mind in a whirl.\r\n\r\nThe game of _boule_ demands undivided attention from its devotees.\r\nTo play with a mind full of other matters is a mistake. This mistake\r\nGeorge made. Hardly conscious of what he was doing, he flung the coin\r\non the board. She had asked him to place it on eight, and he thought\r\nthat he had placed it on eight. That, in reality, blinded by emotion,\r\nhe had placed it on three was a fact which came home to him neither\r\nthen nor later.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when the ball ceased to roll and a sepulchral voice\r\ncroaked the news that eight was the winning number, he fixed on the\r\ncroupier a gaze that began by being joyful and expectant and ended, the\r\ncroupier remaining entirely unresponsive, by being wrathful.\r\n\r\nHe leaned towards him.\r\n\r\n'Monsieur,' he said. _'Moi! J'ai jete cinq francs sur huit!'_\r\n\r\nThe croupier was a man with a pointed moustache and an air of having\r\nseen all the sorrow and wickedness that there had ever been in the\r\nworld. He twisted the former and permitted a faint smile to deepen the\r\nmelancholy of the latter, but he did not speak.\r\n\r\nGeorge moved to his side. The two stout Frenchmen had strolled off,\r\nleaving elbow-room behind them.\r\n\r\nHe tapped the croupier on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n'I say,' he said. 'What's the game? _J'ai jete cinq francs sur\r\nhuit,_ I tell you, _moi!_'\r\n\r\nA forgotten idiom from the days of boyhood and French exercises came to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'_Moi qui parle_,' he added.\r\n\r\n'_Messieurs, faites vos jeux_,' crooned the croupier, in a\r\ndetached manner.\r\n\r\nTo the normal George, as to most Englishmen of his age, the one\r\ncardinal rule in life was at all costs to avoid rendering himself\r\nconspicuous in public. Than George normal, no violet that ever hid\r\nitself in a mossy bank could have had a greater distaste for scenes.\r\nBut tonight he was not normal. Roville and its colour had wrought a\r\nsort of fever in his brain. _Boule_ had increased it. And love had\r\ncaused it to rage. If this had been entirely his own affair it is\r\nprobable that the croupier's frigid calm would have quelled him and he\r\nwould have retired, fermenting but baffled. But it was not his own\r\naffair. He was fighting the cause of the only girl in the world. She\r\nhad trusted him. Could he fail her? No, he was dashed if he could. He\r\nwould show her what he was made of. His heart swelled within him. A\r\nthrill permeated his entire being, starting at his head and running out\r\nat his heels. He felt tremendous--a sort of blend of Oliver Cromwell, a\r\nBerserk warrior, and Sir Galahad.\r\n\r\n'Monsieur,' he said again. 'Hi! What about it?'\r\n\r\nThis time the croupier did speak.\r\n\r\n'_C'est fini_,' he said; and print cannot convey the pensive scorn\r\nof his voice. It stung George, in his exalted mood, like a blow.\r\nFinished, was it? All right, now he would show them. They had asked for\r\nit, and now they should get it. How much did it come to? Five francs\r\nthe stake had been, and you got seven times your stake. And you got\r\nyour stake back. He was nearly forgetting that. Forty francs in all,\r\nthen. Two of those gold what-d'you-call'ems, in fact. Very well, then.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward quickly across the croupier, snatched the lid off the\r\ngold tray, and removed two louis.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact in life that the scenes which we have rehearsed\r\nin our minds never happen as we have pictured them happening. In the\r\npresent case, for instance, it had been George's intention to handle\r\nthe subsequent stages of this little dispute with an easy dignity. He\r\nhad proposed, the money obtained, to hand it over to its rightful\r\nowner, raise his hat, and retire with an air, a gallant champion of the\r\noppressed. It was probably about one-sixteenth of a second after his\r\nhand had closed on the coins that he realized in the most vivid manner\r\nthat these were not the lines on which the incident was to develop,\r\nand, with all his heart, he congratulated himself on having discarded\r\nthose brown boots in favour of a worn but roomy pair of gent's Oxfords.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was a pause and a silence of utter astonishment,\r\nwhile the minds of those who had witnessed the affair adjusted\r\nthemselves to the marvel, and then the world became full of starting\r\neyes, yelling throats, and clutching hands. From all over the casino\r\nfresh units swarmed like bees to swell the crowd at the centre of\r\nthings. Promenaders ceased to promenade, waiters to wait. Elderly\r\ngentlemen sprang on to tables.\r\n\r\nBut in that momentary pause George had got off the mark. The table at\r\nwhich he had been standing was the one nearest to the door, and he had\r\nbeen on the door side of it. As the first eyes began to start, the\r\nfirst throats to yell, and the first hands to clutch, he was passing\r\nthe counter of the money-changer. He charged the swing-door at full\r\nspeed, and, true to its mission, it swung. He had a vague glimpse from\r\nthe corner of his eye of the hat-and-cloak counter, and then he was in\r\nthe square with the cold night breeze blowing on his forehead and the\r\nstars winking down from the blue sky.\r\n\r\nA paper-seller on the pavement, ever the man of business, stepped\r\nforward and offered him the Paris edition of the _Daily Mail_,\r\nand, being in the direct line of transit, shot swiftly into the road\r\nand fell into a heap, while George, shaken but going well, turned off\r\nto the left, where there seemed to be rather more darkness than\r\nanywhere else.\r\n\r\nAnd then the casino disgorged the pursuers.\r\n\r\nTo George, looking hastily over his shoulder, there seemed a thousand\r\nof them. The square rang with their cries. He could not understand\r\nthem, but gathered that they were uncomplimentary. At any rate, they\r\nstimulated a little man in evening dress strolling along the pavement\r\ntowards him, to become suddenly animated and to leap from side to side\r\nwith outstretched arms.\r\n\r\nPanic makes Harlequin three-quarters of us all. For one who had never\r\nplayed Rugby football George handled the situation well. He drew the\r\ndefence with a feint to the left, then, swerving to the right, shot\r\npast into the friendly darkness. From behind came the ringing of feet\r\nand an evergrowing din.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the few compensations a fugitive pursued by a crowd enjoys\r\nthat, while he has space for his manoeuvres, those who pursue are\r\nhampered by their numbers. In the little regiment that pounded at his\r\nheels it is probable that there were many faster runners than George.\r\nOn the other hand, there were many slower, and in the early stages of\r\nthe chase these impeded their swifter brethren. At the end of the first\r\nhalf-minute, therefore, George, not sparing himself, had drawn well\r\nahead, and for the first time found leisure for connected thought.\r\n\r\nHis brain became preternaturally alert, so that when, rounding a\r\ncorner, he perceived entering the main road from a side-street in front\r\nof him a small knot of pedestrians, he did not waver, but was seized\r\nwith a keen spasm of presence of mind. Without pausing in his stride,\r\nhe pointed excitedly before him, and at the same moment shouted the\r\nwords, '_La! La! Vite! Vite!_'\r\n\r\nHis stock of French was small, but it ran to that, and for his purpose\r\nit was ample. The French temperament is not stolid. When the French\r\ntemperament sees a man running rapidly and pointing into the middle\r\ndistance and hears him shouting, '_La! La! Vite! Vite!_' it does\r\nnot stop to make formal inquiries. It sprints like a mustang. It did so\r\nnow, with the happy result that a moment later George was racing down\r\nthe road, the centre and recognized leader of an enthusiastic band of\r\nsix, which, in the next twenty yards, swelled to eleven.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, in a wine-shop near the harbour, he was sipping the\r\nfirst glass of a bottle of cheap but comforting _vin ordinaire_\r\nwhile he explained to the interested proprietor, by means of a mixture\r\nof English, broken French, and gestures that he had been helping to\r\nchase a thief, but had been forced by fatigue to retire prematurely for\r\nrefreshment. The proprietor gathered, however, that he had every\r\nconfidence in the zeal of his still active colleagues.\r\n\r\nIt is convincing evidence of the extent to which love had triumphed\r\nover prudence in George's soul that the advisability of lying hid in\r\nhis hotel on the following day did not even cross his mind. Immediately\r\nafter breakfast, or what passed for it at Roville, he set out for the\r\nHotel Cercle de la Mediterranee to hand over the two louis to their\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nLady Julia, he was informed on arrival, was out. The porter, politely\r\ngenial, advised monsieur to seek her on the Promenade des Etrangers.\r\n\r\nShe was there, on the same seat where she had left the book.\r\n\r\n'Good morning,' he said.\r\n\r\nShe had not seen him coming, and she started at his voice. The flush\r\nwas back on her face as she turned to him. There was a look of\r\nastonishment in the grey eyes.\r\n\r\nHe held out the two louis.\r\n\r\n'I couldn't give them to you last night,' he said.\r\n\r\nA horrible idea seized him. It had not occurred to him before.\r\n\r\n'I say,' he stammered--'I say, I hope you don't think I had run off\r\nwith your winnings for good! The croupier wouldn't give them up, you\r\nknow, so I had to grab them and run. They came to exactly two louis.\r\nYou put on five francs, you know, and you get seven times your stake.\r\nI--'\r\n\r\nAn elderly lady seated on the bench, who had loomed from behind a\r\nparasol towards the middle of these remarks, broke abruptly into\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n'Who is this young man?'\r\n\r\nGeorge looked at her, startled. He had hardly been aware of her\r\npresence till now. Rapidly he diagnosed her as a mother--or aunt. She\r\nlooked more like an aunt. Of course, it must seem odd to her, his\r\ncharging in like this, a perfect stranger, and beginning to chat with\r\nher daughter, or niece, or whatever it was. He began to justify\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n'I met your--this young lady'--something told him that was not the\r\nproper way to put it, but hang it, what else could he say?--'at the\r\ncasino last night.'\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The effect of his words on the elderly lady was remarkable.\r\nHer face seemed to turn to stone and become all sharp points. She\r\nstared at the girl.\r\n\r\n'So you were gambling at the casino last night?' she said.\r\n\r\nShe rose from the seat, a frozen statue of displeasure.\r\n\r\n'I shall return to the hotel. When you have arranged your financial\r\ntransactions with your--friend, I should like to speak to you. You will\r\nfind me in my room.'\r\n\r\nGeorge looked after her dumbly.\r\n\r\nThe girl spoke, in a curiously strained voice, as if she were speaking\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\n'I don't care,' she said. 'I'm glad.'\r\n\r\nGeorge was concerned.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid your mother is offended, Lady Julia.'\r\n\r\nThere was a puzzled look in her grey eyes as they met his. Then they\r\nlit up. She leaned back in the seat and began to laugh, softly at\r\nfirst, and then with a note that jarred on George. Whatever the humour\r\nof the situation--and he had not detected it at present--this mirth, he\r\nfelt, was unnatural and excessive.\r\n\r\nShe checked herself at length, and a flush crept over her face.\r\n\r\n'I don't know why I did that,' she said, abruptly. 'I'm sorry. There\r\nwas nothing funny in what you said. But I'm not Lady Julia, and I have\r\nno mother. That was Lady Julia who has just gone, and I am nothing more\r\nimportant than her companion.'\r\n\r\n'Her companion!'\r\n\r\n'I had better say her late companion. It will soon be that. I had\r\nstrict orders, you see, not to go near the casino without her--and I\r\nwent.'\r\n\r\n'Then--then I've lost you your job--I mean, your position! If it hadn't\r\nbeen for me she wouldn't have known. I--'\r\n\r\n'You have done me a great service,' she said. 'You have cut the painter\r\nfor me when I have been trying for months to muster up the courage to\r\ncut it for myself. I don't suppose you know what it is to get into a\r\ngroove and long to get out of it and not have the pluck. My brother has\r\nbeen writing to me for a long time to join him in Canada. And I hadn't\r\nthe courage, or the energy, or whatever it is that takes people out of\r\ngrooves. I knew I was wasting my life, but I was fairly happy--at\r\nleast, not unhappy; so--well, there it was. I suppose women are like\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\n'And now--?'\r\n\r\n'And now you have jerked me out of the groove. I shall go out to Bob by\r\nthe first boat.'\r\n\r\nHe scratched the concrete thoughtfully with his stick.\r\n\r\n'It's a hard life out there,' he said.\r\n\r\n'But it _is_ a life.'\r\n\r\nHe looked at the strollers on the promenade. They seemed very far\r\naway--in another world.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said, hoarsely, and stopped. 'May I sit down?' he\r\nasked, abruptly. 'I've got something to say, and I can't say it when\r\nI'm looking at you.'\r\n\r\nHe sat down, and fastened his gaze on a yacht that swayed at anchor\r\nagainst the cloudless sky.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said. 'Will you marry me?'\r\n\r\nHe heard her turn quickly, and felt her eyes upon him. He went on\r\ndoggedly.\r\n\r\n'I know,' he said, 'we only met yesterday. You probably think I'm mad.'\r\n\r\n'I don't think you're mad,' she said, quietly. 'I only think you're too\r\nquixotic. You're sorry for me and you are letting a kind impulse carry\r\nyou away, as you did last night at the casino. It's like you.'\r\n\r\nFor the first time he turned towards her.\r\n\r\n'I don't know what you suppose I am,' he said, 'but I'll tell you. I'm\r\na clerk in an insurance office. I get a hundred a year and ten days'\r\nholiday. Did you take me for a millionaire? If I am, I'm only a\r\ntuppenny one. Somebody left me a thousand pounds a few weeks ago.\r\nThat's how I come to be here. Now you know all about me. I don't know\r\nanything about you except that I shall never love anybody else. Marry\r\nme, and we'll go to Canada together. You say I've helped you out of\r\nyour groove. Well, I've only one chance of getting out of mine, and\r\nthat's through you. If you won't help me, I don't care if I get out of\r\nit or not. Will you pull me out?'\r\n\r\nShe did not speak. She sat looking out to sea, past the many-coloured\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nHe watched her face, but her hat shaded her eyes and he could read\r\nnothing in it.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, without quite knowing how it had got there, he\r\nfound that her hand was in his, and he was clutching it as a drowning\r\nman clutches a rope.\r\n\r\nHe could see her eyes now, and there was a message in them that set his\r\nheart racing. A great content filled him. She was so companionable,\r\nsuch a friend. It seemed incredible to him that it was only yesterday\r\nthat they had met for the first time.\r\n\r\n'And now,' she said, 'would you mind telling me your name?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little waves murmured as they rolled lazily up the beach. Somewhere\r\nbehind the trees in the gardens a band had begun to play. The breeze,\r\nblowing in from the blue Mediterranean, was charged with salt and\r\nhappiness. And from a seat on the promenade, a young man swept the\r\ncrowd with a defiant gaze.\r\n\r\n'It isn't true,' it seemed to say. 'I'm not a jelly-fish.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAHEAD OF SCHEDULE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was to Wilson, his valet, with whom he frequently chatted in airy\r\nfashion before rising of a morning, that Rollo Finch first disclosed\r\nhis great idea. Wilson was a man of silent habit, and men of silent\r\nhabit rarely escaped Rollo's confidences.\r\n\r\n'Wilson,' he said one morning from the recesses of his bed, as the\r\nvalet entered with his shaving-water, 'have you ever been in love?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' said the valet, unperturbed.\r\n\r\nOne would hardly have expected the answer to be in the affirmative.\r\nLike most valets and all chauffeurs, Wilson gave the impression of\r\nbeing above the softer emotions.\r\n\r\n'What happened?' inquired Rollo.\r\n\r\n'It came to nothing, sir,' said Wilson, beginning to strop the razor\r\nwith no appearance of concern.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said Rollo. 'And I bet I know why. You didn't go the right way to\r\nwork.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Not one fellow in a hundred does. I know. I've thought it out. I've\r\nbeen thinking the deuce of a lot about it lately. It's dashed tricky,\r\nthis making love. Most fellows haven't a notion how to work it. No\r\nsystem. No system, Wilson, old scout.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Now, I _have_ a system. And I'll tell it you. It may do you a bit\r\nof good next time you feel that impulse. You're not dead yet. Now, my\r\nsystem is simply to go to it gradually, by degrees. Work by schedule.\r\nSee what I mean?'\r\n\r\n'Not entirely, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll give you the details. First thing, you want to find the\r\ngirl.'\r\n\r\n'Just so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, when you've found her, what do you do? You just look at her. See\r\nwhat I mean?'\r\n\r\n'Not entirely, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Look at her, my boy. That's just the start--the foundation. You\r\ndevelop from that. But you keep away. That's the point. I've thought\r\nthis thing out. Mind you, I don't claim absolutely all the credit for\r\nthe idea myself. It's by way of being based on Christian Science.\r\nAbsent treatment, and all that. But most of it's mine. All the fine\r\nwork.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Absolutely all the fine work. Here's the thing in a nutshell. You\r\nfind the girl. Right. Of course, you've got to meet her once, just to\r\nestablish the connexion. Then you get busy. First week, looks. Just\r\nlook at her. Second week, letters. Write to her every day. Third week,\r\nflowers. Send her some every afternoon. Fourth week, presents with a\r\nbit more class about them. Bit of jewellery now and then. See what I\r\nmean? Fifth week,--lunches and suppers and things. Sixth week, propose,\r\nthough you can do it in the fifth week if you see a chance. You've got\r\nto leave that to the fellow's judgement. Well, there you are. See what\r\nI mean?'\r\n\r\nWilson stropped his master's razor thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'A trifle elaborate, sir, is it not?' he said.\r\n\r\nRollo thumped the counterpane.\r\n\r\n'I knew you'd say that. That's what nine fellows out of ten\r\n_would_ say. They'd want to rush it. I tell you, Wilson, old\r\nscout, you _can't_ rush it.'\r\n\r\nWilson brooded awhile, his mind back in the passionate past.\r\n\r\n'In Market Bumpstead, sir--'\r\n\r\n'What the deuce is Market Bumpstead?'\r\n\r\n'A village, sir, where I lived until I came to London.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'In Market Bumpstead, sir, the prevailing custom was to escort the\r\nyoung lady home from church, buy her some little present--some ribbons,\r\npossibly--next day, take her for a walk, and kiss her, sir.'\r\n\r\nWilson's voice, as he unfolded these devices of the dashing youth of\r\nMarket Bumpstead, had taken on an animation quite unsuitable to a\r\nconscientious valet. He gave the impression of a man who does not\r\ndepend on idle rumour for his facts. His eye gleamed unprofessionally\r\nfor a moment before resuming its habitual expression of quiet\r\nintrospection.\r\n\r\nRollo shook his head.\r\n\r\n'That sort of thing might work in a village,' he said, 'but you want\r\nsomething better for London.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRollo Finch--in the present unsatisfactory state of the law parents may\r\nstill christen a child Rollo--was a youth to whom Nature had given a\r\ncheerful disposition not marred by any superfluity of brain. Everyone\r\nliked Rollo--the great majority on sight, the rest as soon as they\r\nheard that he would be a millionaire on the death of his Uncle Andrew.\r\nThere is a subtle something, a sort of nebulous charm, as it were,\r\nabout young men who will be millionaires on the death of their Uncle\r\nAndrew which softens the ruggedest misanthrope.\r\n\r\nRollo's mother had been a Miss Galloway, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\r\nU.S.A.; and Andrew Galloway, the world-famous Braces King, the inventor\r\nand proprietor of the inimitable 'Tried and Proven', was her brother.\r\nHis braces had penetrated to every corner of the earth. Wherever\r\ncivilization reigned you would find men wearing Galloway's 'Tried and\r\nProven'.\r\n\r\nBetween Rollo and this human benefactor there had always existed\r\nfriendly relations, and it was an open secret that, unless his uncle\r\nwere to marry and supply the world with little Galloways as well as\r\nbraces, the young man would come into his money.\r\n\r\nSo Rollo moved on his way through life, popular and happy. Always merry\r\nand bright. That was Rollo.\r\n\r\nOr nearly always. For there were moments--we all have our greyer\r\nmoments--when he could have wished that Mr Galloway had been a trifle\r\nolder or a trifle less robust. The Braces potentate was at present\r\npassing, in excellent health, through the Indian summer of life. He\r\nwas, moreover, as has been stated, by birth and residence a Pittsburgh\r\nman. And the tendency of middle-aged Pittsburgh millionaires to marry\r\nchorus-girls is notoriously like the homing instinct of pigeons.\r\nSomething--it may be the smoke--seems to work on them like a charm.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Andrew Galloway, Nature had been thwarted up till now by\r\nthe accident of an unfortunate attachment in early life. The facts were\r\nnot fully known, but it was generally understood that his fiancee had\r\nexercised Woman's prerogative and changed her mind. Also, that she had\r\ndone this on the actual wedding-day, causing annoyance to all, and had\r\nclinched the matter by eloping to Jersey City with the prospective\r\nbridegroom's own coachman. Whatever the facts, there was no doubt about\r\ntheir result. Mr Galloway, having abjured woman utterly, had flung\r\nhimself with moody energy into the manufacture and propagation of his\r\n'Tried and Proven' Braces, and had found consolation in it ever since.\r\nHe would be strong, he told himself, like his braces. Hearts might snap\r\nbeneath a sudden strain. Not so the 'Tried and Proven'. Love might tug\r\nand tug again, but never more should the trousers of passion break away\r\nfrom the tough, masterful braces of self-control.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Galloway had been in this frame of mind for a matter of eleven\r\nyears, it seemed to Rollo not unreasonable to hope that he might\r\ncontinue in it permanently. He had the very strongest objection to his\r\nuncle marrying a chorus-girl; and, as the years went on and the\r\ndisaster did not happen, his hopes of playing the role of heir till the\r\nfall of the curtain grew stronger and stronger. He was one of those\r\nyoung men who must be heirs or nothing. This is the age of the\r\nspecialist, and years ago Rollo had settled on his career. Even as a\r\nboy, hardly capable of connected thought, he had been convinced that\r\nhis speciality, the one thing he could do really well, was to inherit\r\nmoney. All he wanted was a chance. It would be bitter if Fate should\r\nwithhold it from him.\r\n\r\nHe did not object on principle to men marrying chorus-girls. On the\r\ncontrary, he wanted to marry one himself.\r\n\r\nIt was this fact which had given that turn to his thoughts which had\r\nfinally resulted in the schedule.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first intimation that Wilson had that the schedule was actually to\r\nbe put into practical operation was when his employer, one Monday\r\nevening, requested him to buy a medium-sized bunch of the best red\r\nroses and deliver them personally, with a note, to Miss Marguerite\r\nParker at the stage-door of the Duke of Cornwall's Theatre.\r\n\r\nWilson received the order in his customary gravely deferential manner,\r\nand was turning to go; but Rollo had more to add.\r\n\r\n'Flowers, Wilson,' he said, significantly.\r\n\r\n'So I understood you to say, sir. I will see to it at once.'\r\n\r\n'See what I mean? Third week, Wilson.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\nRollo remained for a moment in what he would have called thought.\r\n\r\n'Charming girl, Wilson.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Seen the show?'\r\n\r\n'Not yet, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You should,' said Rollo, earnestly. 'Take my advice, old scout, and\r\nsee it first chance you get. It's topping. I've had the same seat in\r\nthe middle of the front row of the stalls for two weeks.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Looks, Wilson! The good old schedule.'\r\n\r\n'Have you noticed any satisfactory results, sir?'\r\n\r\n'It's working. On Saturday night she looked at me five times. She's a\r\ndelightful girl, Wilson. Nice, quiet girl--not the usual sort. I met\r\nher first at a lunch at Oddy's. She's the last girl on the O.P. side.\r\nI'm sure you'd like her, Wilson.'\r\n\r\n'I have every confidence in your taste, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You'll see her for yourself this evening. Don't let the fellow at the\r\nstage-door put you off. Slip him half a crown or a couple of quid or\r\nsomething, and say you must see her personally. Are you a close\r\nobserver, Wilson?'\r\n\r\n'I think so, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Because I want you to notice particularly how she takes it. See that\r\nshe reads the note in your presence. I've taken a good deal of trouble\r\nover that note, Wilson. It's a good note. Well expressed. Watch her\r\nface while she's reading it.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir. Excuse me, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?'\r\n\r\n'I had almost forgotten to mention it. Mr Galloway rang up on the\r\ntelephone shortly before you came in.'\r\n\r\n'What! Is he in England?'\r\n\r\nMr Galloway was in the habit of taking occasional trips to Great\r\nBritain to confer with the general manager of his London branch. Rollo\r\nhad grown accustomed to receiving no notice of these visits.\r\n\r\n'He arrived two days ago on the _Baltic_, sir. He left a message\r\nthat he was in London for a week, and would be glad if you would dine\r\nwith him tomorrow at his club.'\r\n\r\nRollo nodded. On these occasions it was his practice to hold himself\r\nunreservedly at Mr Galloway's disposal. The latter's invitations were\r\nroyal commands. Rollo was glad that the visit had happened now. In\r\nanother two weeks it might have been disastrous to the schedule.\r\n\r\nThe club to which the Braces King belonged was a richly but gloomily\r\nfurnished building in Pall Mall, a place of soft carpets, shaded\r\nlights, and whispers. Grave, elderly men moved noiselessly to and fro,\r\nor sat in meditative silence in deep arm-chairs. Sometimes the visitor\r\nfelt that he was in a cathedral, sometimes in a Turkish bath; while now\r\nand then there was a suggestion of the waiting-room of a more than\r\nusually prosperous dentist. It was magnificent, but not exhilarating.\r\n\r\nRollo was shown into the smoking-room, where his uncle received him.\r\nThere was a good deal of Mr Andrew Galloway. Grief, gnawing at his\r\nheart, had not sagged his ample waistcoat, which preceded him as he\r\nmoved in much the same manner as Birnam Woods preceded the army of\r\nMacduff. A well-nourished hand crept round the corner of the edifice\r\nand enveloped Rollo's in a powerful grip.\r\n\r\n'Ah, my boy!' bellowed Mr Galloway cheerfully. His voice was always\r\nloud. 'Glad you've come.'\r\n\r\nIt would be absurd to say that Rollo looked at his uncle keenly. He was\r\nnot capable of looking keenly at anyone. But certainly a puzzled\r\nexpression came into his face. Whether it was the heartiness of the\r\nother's hand-shake or the unusual cheeriness of his voice, he could not\r\nsay; but something gave him the impression that a curious change had\r\ncome over the Braces King. When they had met before during the last few\r\nyears Mr Galloway had been practically sixteen stone five of blood and\r\niron--one of those stern, soured men. His attitude had been that of one\r\nfor whom Life's music had ceased. Had he then inserted another record?\r\nHis manner conveyed that idea.\r\n\r\nSustained thought always gave Rollo a headache. He ceased to speculate.\r\n\r\n'Still got the same _chef_ here, uncle?' he said. 'Deuced brainy\r\nfellow. I always like dining here.'\r\n\r\n'Here!' Mr Galloway surveyed the somnolent occupants of the room with\r\nspirited scorn. 'We aren't going to dine in this forsaken old\r\nmausoleum. I've sent in my resignation today. If I find myself wanting\r\nthis sort of thing at any time, I'll go to Paris and hunt up the\r\nMorgue. Bunch of old dead-beats! Bah! I've engaged a table at Romano's.\r\nThat's more in my line. Get your coat, and let's be going.'\r\n\r\nIn the cab Rollo risked the headache. At whatever cost this thing must\r\nbe pondered over. His uncle prattled gaily throughout the journey. Once\r\nhe whooped--some weird, forgotten college yell, dragged from the misty\r\ndepths of the past. It was passing strange. And in this unusual manner\r\nthe two rolled into the Strand, and drew up at Romano's door.\r\n\r\nMr Galloway was a good trencherman. At a very early date he had\r\nrealized that a man who wishes to make satisfactory braces must keep\r\nhis strength up. He wanted a good deal here below, and he wanted it\r\nwarm and well cooked. It was, therefore, not immediately that his\r\ndinner with Rollo became a feast of reason and a flow of soul. Indeed,\r\nthe two revellers had lighted their cigars before the elder gave forth\r\nany remark that was not purely gastronomic.\r\n\r\nWhen he did jerk the conversation up on to a higher plane, he jerked it\r\nhard. He sent it shooting into the realms of the soulful with a whiz.\r\n\r\n'Rollo,' he said, blowing a smoke-ring, 'do you believe in affinities?'\r\n\r\nRollo, in the act of sipping a liqueur brandy, lowered his glass in\r\nsurprise. His head was singing slightly as the result of some rather\r\nspirited Bollinger (extra sec), and he wondered if he had heard aright.\r\n\r\nMr Galloway continued, his voice rising as he spoke.\r\n\r\n'My boy,' he said, 'I feel young tonight for the first time in years.\r\nAnd, hang it, I'm not so old! Men have married at twice my age.'\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, this was incorrect, unless one counted Methuselah;\r\nbut perhaps Mr Galloway spoke figuratively.\r\n\r\n'Three times my age,' he proceeded, leaning back and blowing smoke,\r\nthereby missing his nephew's agitated start. 'Four times my age. Five\r\ntimes my age. Six--'\r\n\r\nHe pulled himself together in some confusion. A generous wine, that\r\nBollinger. He must be careful.\r\n\r\nHe coughed.\r\n\r\n'Are you--you aren't--are you--' Rollo paused. 'Are you thinking of\r\ngetting married, uncle?'\r\n\r\nMr Galloway's gaze was still on the ceiling.\r\n\r\n'A great deal of nonsense,' he yelled severely, 'is talked about men\r\nlowering themselves by marrying actresses. I was a guest at a\r\nsupper-party last night at which an actress was present. And a more\r\ncharming, sensible girl I never wish to meet. Not one of your silly,\r\nbrainless chits who don't know the difference between lobster Newburg\r\nand canvas-back duck, and who prefer sweet champagne to dry. No, sir!\r\nNot one of your mincing, affected kind who pretend they never touch\r\nanything except a spoonful of cold _consomme_. No, sir! Good, healthy\r\nappetite. Enjoyed her food, and knew why she was enjoying it. I give\r\nyou my word, my boy, until I met her I didn't know a woman existed who\r\ncould talk so damned sensibly about a _bavaroise au rhum_.'\r\n\r\nHe suspended his striking tribute in order to relight his cigar.\r\n\r\n'She can use a chafing-dish,' he resumed, his voice vibrating with\r\nemotion. 'She told me so. She said she could fix chicken so that a man\r\nwould leave home for it.' He paused, momentarily overcome. '_And_\r\nWelsh rarebits,' he added reverently.\r\n\r\nHe puffed hard at his cigar.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he said. 'Welsh rarebits, too. And because,' he shouted\r\nwrathfully, 'because, forsooth, she earns an honest living by singing\r\nin the chorus of a comic opera, a whole bunch of snivelling idiots will\r\nsay I have made a fool of myself. Let them!' he bellowed, sitting up\r\nand glaring at Rollo. 'I say, let them! I'll show them that Andrew\r\nGalloway is not the man to--to--is not the man--' He stopped. 'Well,\r\nanyway, I'll show them,' he concluded rather lamely.\r\n\r\nRollo eyed him with fallen jaw. His liqueur had turned to wormwood. He\r\nhad been fearing this for years. You may drive out Nature with a\r\npitchfork, but she will return. Blood will tell. Once a Pittsburgh\r\nmillionaire, always a Pittsburgh millionaire. For eleven years his\r\nuncle had fought against his natural propensities, with apparent\r\nsuccess; but Nature had won in the end. His words could have no other\r\nmeaning. Andrew Galloway was going to marry a chorus-girl.\r\n\r\nMr Galloway rapped on the table, and ordered another kummel.\r\n\r\n'Marguerite Parker!' he roared dreamily, rolling the words round his\r\ntongue, like port.\r\n\r\n'Marguerite Parker!' exclaimed Rollo, bounding in his chair.\r\n\r\nHis uncle met his eye sternly.\r\n\r\n'That was the name I said. You seem to know it. Perhaps you have\r\nsomething to say against the lady. Eh? Have you? Have you? I warn you\r\nto be careful. What do you know of Miss Parker? Speak!'\r\n\r\n'Er--no, no. Oh, no! I just know the name, that's all. I--I rather\r\nthink I met her once at lunch. Or it may have been somebody else. I\r\nknow it was someone.'\r\n\r\nHe plunged at his glass. His uncle's gaze relaxed its austerity.\r\n\r\n'I hope you will meet her many more times at lunch, my boy. I hope you\r\nwill come to look upon her as a second mother.'\r\n\r\nThis was where Rollo asked if he might have a little more brandy.\r\n\r\nWhen the restorative came he drank it at a gulp; then looked across at\r\nhis uncle. The great man still mused.\r\n\r\n'Er--when is it to be?' asked Rollo. 'The wedding, and all that?'\r\n\r\n'Hardly before the Fall, I think. No, not before the Fall. I shall be\r\nbusy till then. I have taken no steps in the matter yet.'\r\n\r\n'No steps? You mean--? Haven't you--haven't you proposed?'\r\n\r\n'I have had no time. Be reasonable, my boy; be reasonable.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' said Rollo.\r\n\r\nHe breathed a long breath. A suspicion of silver lining had become\r\nvisible through the clouds.\r\n\r\n'I doubt,' said Mr Galloway, meditatively, 'if I shall be able to find\r\ntime till the end of the week. I am very busy. Let me see. Tomorrow?\r\nNo. Meeting of the shareholders. Thursday? Friday? No. No, it will have\r\nto stand over till Saturday. After Saturday's matinee. That will do\r\nexcellently.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a dramatic spectacle to be observed every day in this land of\r\nours, which, though deserving of recognition, no artist has yet\r\npictured on canvas. We allude to the suburban season-ticket holder's\r\nsudden flash of speed. Everyone must have seen at one time or another a\r\nhappy, bright-faced season-ticket holder strolling placidly towards the\r\nstation, humming, perhaps, in his light-heartedness, some gay air. He\r\nfeels secure. Fate cannot touch him, for he has left himself for once\r\nplenty of time to catch that 8.50, for which he has so often sprinted\r\nlike the gazelle of the prairie. As he strolls, suddenly his eye falls\r\non the church clock. The next moment with a passionate cry he is\r\nendeavouring to lower his record for the fifty-yard dash. All the while\r\nhis watch has been fifteen minutes slow.\r\n\r\nIn just such a case was Rollo Finch. He had fancied that he had plenty\r\nof time. And now, in an instant, the fact was borne in upon him that he\r\nmust hurry.\r\n\r\nFor the greater part of the night of his uncle's dinner he lay\r\nsleepless, vainly endeavouring to find a way out of the difficulty. It\r\nwas not till early morning that he faced the inevitable. He hated to\r\nabandon the schedule. To do so meant changing a well-ordered advance\r\ninto a forlorn hope. But circumstances compelled it. There are moments\r\nwhen speed alone can save love's season-ticket holder.\r\n\r\nOn the following afternoon he acted. It was no occasion for stint. He\r\nhad to condense into one day the carefully considered movements of two\r\nweeks, and to the best of his ability he did so. He bought three\r\nbouquets, a bracelet, and a gold Billiken with ruby eyes, and sent them\r\nto the theatre by messenger-boy. With them went an invitation to\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nThen, with the feeling that he had done all that was possible, he\r\nreturned to his flat and waited for the hour.\r\n\r\nHe dressed with more than usual care that night. Your wise general\r\nnever throws away a move. He was particular about his tie. As a rule,\r\nWilson selected one for him. But there had been times when Wilson had\r\nmade mistakes. One could not rely absolutely on Wilson's taste in ties.\r\nHe did not blame him. Better men than Wilson had gone wrong over an\r\nevening tie. But tonight there must be no taking of chances.\r\n\r\n'Where do we keep our ties, Wilson?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'The closet to the right of the door, sir. The first twelve shallow\r\nshelves, counting from the top, sir. They contain a fair selection of\r\nour various cravats. Replicas in bulk are to be found in the third nest\r\nof drawers in your dressing-room, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I only want one, my good man. I'm not a regiment. Ah! I stake all on\r\nthis one. Not a word, Wilson. No discussion. This is the tie I wear.\r\nWhat's the time?'\r\n\r\n'Eight minutes to eleven, sir.'\r\n\r\n'I must be off. I shall be late. I shan't want you any more tonight.\r\nDon't wait for me.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, sir.'\r\n\r\nRollo left the room, pale but determined, and hailed a taxi.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant spot, the vestibule of the Carlton Hotel.\r\nGlare--glitter--distant music--fair women--brave men. But one can have\r\ntoo much of it, and as the moments pass, and she does not arrive, a\r\nchill seems to creep into the atmosphere. We wait on, hoping against\r\nhope, and at last, just as waiters and commissionaires are beginning to\r\neye us with suspicion, we face the truth. She is not coming. Then out we\r\ncrawl into cold, callous Pall Mall, and so home. You have been through\r\nit, dear reader, and so have I.\r\n\r\nAnd so, at eleven forty-five that evening, had Rollo. For a full\r\nthree-quarters of an hour he waited, scanning the face of each new\r\narrival with the anxious scrutiny of a lost dog seeking its master; but\r\nat fourteen minutes to twelve the last faint flicker of hope had died\r\naway. A girl may be a quarter of an hour late for supper. She may be\r\nhalf an hour late. But there is a limit, and to Rollo's mind forty-five\r\nminutes passed it. At ten minutes to twelve a uniformed official\r\noutside the Carlton signalled to a taxi-cab, and there entered it a\r\nyoung man whose faith in Woman was dead.\r\n\r\nRollo meditated bitterly as he drove home. It was not so much the fact\r\nthat she had not come that stirred him. Many things may keep a girl\r\nfrom supper. It was the calm way in which she had ignored the\r\ninvitation. When you send a girl three bouquets, a bracelet, and a gold\r\nBilliken with ruby eyes, you do not expect an entire absence of\r\nrecognition. Even a penny-in-the-slot machine treats you better than\r\nthat. It may give you hairpins when you want matches but at least it\r\ntakes some notice of you.\r\n\r\nHe was still deep in gloomy thought when he inserted his latchkey and\r\nopened the door of his flat.\r\n\r\nHe was roused from his reflections by a laugh from the sitting-room. He\r\nstarted. It was a pleasant laugh, and musical, but it sent Rollo\r\ndiving, outraged, for the handle of the door. What was a woman doing in\r\nhis sitting-room at this hour? Was his flat an hotel?\r\n\r\nThe advent of an unbidden guest rarely fails to produce a certain\r\n_gene_. The sudden appearance of Rollo caused a dead silence.\r\n\r\nIt was broken by the fall of a chair on the carpet as Wilson rose\r\nhurriedly to his feet.\r\n\r\nRollo stood in the doorway, an impressive statue of restrained\r\nindignation. He could see the outlying portions of a girl in blue at\r\nthe further end of the table, but Wilson obscured his vision.\r\n\r\n'Didn't expect you back, sir,' said Wilson.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of their acquaintance his accustomed\r\ncalm seemed somewhat ruffled.\r\n\r\n'So I should think,' said Rollo. 'I believe you, by George!'\r\n\r\n'You had better explain, Jim,' said a dispassionate voice from the end\r\nof the table.\r\n\r\nWilson stepped aside.\r\n\r\n'My wife, sir,' he said, apologetically, but with pride.\r\n\r\n'Your wife!'\r\n\r\n'We were married this morning, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe lady nodded cheerfully at Rollo. She was small and slight, with an\r\nimpudent nose and a mass of brown hair.\r\n\r\n'Awfully glad to meet you,' she said, cracking a walnut.\r\n\r\nRollo gaped.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again.\r\n\r\n'We've met, haven't we? Oh yes, I remember. We met at lunch once. And\r\nyou sent me some flowers. It was ever so kind of you,' she said,\r\nbeaming.\r\n\r\nShe cracked another nut. She seemed to consider that the introductions\r\nwere complete and that formality could now be dispensed with once more.\r\nShe appeared at peace with all men.\r\n\r\nThe situation was slipping from Rollo's grip. He continued to gape.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered his grievance.\r\n\r\n'I think you might have let me know you weren't coming to supper.'\r\n\r\n'Supper?'\r\n\r\n'I sent a note to the theatre this afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'I haven't been to the theatre today. They let me off because I was\r\ngoing to be married. I'm so sorry. I hope you didn't wait long.'\r\n\r\nRollo's resentment melted before the friendliness of her smile.\r\n\r\n'Hardly any time,' he said, untruthfully.\r\n\r\n'If I might explain, sir,' said Wilson.\r\n\r\n'By George! If you can, you'll save me from a brainstorm. Cut loose,\r\nand don't be afraid you'll bore me. You won't.'\r\n\r\n'Mrs Wilson and I are old friends, sir. We come from the same town. In\r\nfact--'\r\n\r\nRollo's face cleared.\r\n\r\n'By George! Market what's-its-name! Why, of course. Then she--'\r\n\r\n'Just so, sir. If you recollect, you asked me once if I had ever been\r\nin love, and I replied in the affirmative.'\r\n\r\n'And it was--'\r\n\r\n'Mrs Wilson and I were engaged to be married before either of us came\r\nto London. There was a misunderstanding, which was entirely my--'\r\n\r\n'Jim! It was mine.'\r\n\r\n'No, it was all through my being a fool.'\r\n\r\n'It was not. You know it wasn't!'\r\n\r\nRollo intervened.\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'And when you sent me with the flowers, sir--well, we talked it over\r\nagain, and--that was how it came about, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe bride looked up from her walnuts.\r\n\r\n'You aren't angry?' she smiled up at Rollo.\r\n\r\n'Angry?' He reflected. Of course, it was only reasonable that he should\r\nbe a little--well, not exactly angry, but--And then for the first time\r\nit came to him that the situation was not entirely without its\r\ncompensations. Until that moment he had completely forgotten Mr\r\nGalloway.\r\n\r\n'Angry?' he said. 'Great Scott, no! Jolly glad I came back in time to\r\nget a bit of the wedding-breakfast. I want it, I can tell you. I'm\r\nhungry. Here we all are, eh? Let's enjoy ourselves. Wilson, old scout,\r\nbustle about and give us your imitation of a bridegroom mixing a \"B.\r\nand S.\" for the best man. Mrs Wilson, if you'll look in at the theatre\r\ntomorrow you'll find one or two small wedding presents waiting for you.\r\nThree bouquets--they'll be a bit withered, I'm afraid--a bracelet, and\r\na gold Billiken with ruby eyes. I hope he'll bring you luck. Oh,\r\nWilson!'\r\n\r\n'Sir?'\r\n\r\n'Touching this little business--don't answer if it's a delicate\r\nquestion, but I _should_ like to know--I suppose you didn't try\r\nthe schedule. What? More the Market Thingummy method, eh? The one you\r\ndescribed to me?'\r\n\r\n'Market Bumpstead, sir?' said Wilson. 'On those lines.'\r\n\r\nRollo nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n'It seems to me,' he said, 'they know a thing or two down in Market\r\nBumpstead.'\r\n\r\n'A very rising little place, sir,' assented Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR AGRAVAINE\r\nA TALE OF KING ARTHUR'S ROUND TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time ago, when spending a delightful week-end at the ancestral\r\ncastle of my dear old friend, the Duke of Weatherstonhope (pronounced\r\nWop), I came across an old black-letter MS. It is on this that the\r\nstory which follows is based.\r\n\r\nI have found it necessary to touch the thing up a little here and\r\nthere, for writers in those days were weak in construction. Their idea\r\nof telling a story was to take a long breath and start droning away\r\nwithout any stops or dialogue till the thing was over.\r\n\r\nI have also condensed the title. In the original it ran, '\"How it came\r\nabout that ye good Knight Sir Agravaine ye Dolorous of ye Table Round\r\ndid fare forth to succour a damsel in distress and after divers\r\njourneyings and perils by flood and by field did win her for his bride\r\nand right happily did they twain live ever afterwards,\" by Ambrose ye\r\nmonk.'\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty snappy title for those days, but we have such a high\r\nstandard in titles nowadays that I have felt compelled to omit a few\r\nyards of it.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to the story.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great tournament was in full swing. All through the afternoon\r\nboiler-plated knights on mettlesome chargers had hurled themselves on\r\neach other's spears, to the vast contentment of all. Bright eyes shone;\r\nhandkerchiefs fluttered; musical voices urged chosen champions to knock\r\nthe cover off their brawny adversaries. The cheap seats had long since\r\nbecome hoarse with emotion. All round the arena rose the cries of\r\nitinerant merchants: 'Iced malvoisie,' 'Score-cards; ye cannot tell the\r\njousters without a score-card.' All was revelry and excitement.\r\n\r\nA hush fell on the throng. From either end of the arena a mounted\r\nknight in armour had entered.\r\n\r\nThe herald raised his hand.\r\n\r\n'Ladeez'n gemmen! Battling Galahad and Agravaine the Dolorous. Galahad\r\non my right, Agravaine on my left. Squires out of the ring. Time!'\r\n\r\nA speculator among the crowd offered six to one on Galahad, but found\r\nno takers. Nor was the public's caution without reason.\r\n\r\nA moment later the two had met in a cloud of dust, and Agravaine,\r\nshooting over his horse's crupper, had fallen with a metallic clang.\r\n\r\nHe picked himself up, and limped slowly from the arena. He was not\r\nunused to this sort of thing. Indeed, nothing else had happened to him\r\nin his whole jousting career.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that Sir Agravaine the Dolorous was out of his element at\r\nKing Arthur's court, and he knew it. It was this knowledge that had\r\ngiven him that settled air of melancholy from which he derived his\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\nUntil I came upon this black-letter MS. I had been under the\r\nimpression, like, I presume, everybody else, that every Knight of the\r\nRound Table was a model of physical strength and beauty. Malory says\r\nnothing to suggest the contrary. Nor does Tennyson. But apparently\r\nthere were exceptions, of whom Sir Agravaine the Dolorous must have\r\nbeen the chief.\r\n\r\nThere was, it seems, nothing to mitigate this unfortunate man's\r\nphysical deficiencies. There is a place in the world for the strong,\r\nugly man, and there is a place for the weak, handsome man. But to fall\r\nshort both in features and in muscle is to stake your all on brain. And\r\nin the days of King Arthur you did not find the populace turning out to\r\ndo homage to brain. It was a drug on the market. Agravaine was a good\r\ndeal better equipped than his contemporaries with grey matter, but his\r\nheight in his socks was but five feet four; and his muscles, though he\r\nhad taken three correspondence courses in physical culture, remained\r\ndistressingly flaccid. His eyes were pale and mild, his nose snub, and\r\nhis chin receded sharply from his lower lip, as if Nature, designing\r\nhim, had had to leave off in a hurry and finish the job anyhow. The\r\nupper teeth, protruding, completed the resemblance to a nervous rabbit.\r\n\r\nHandicapped in this manner, it is no wonder that he should feel sad and\r\nlonely in King Arthur's court. At heart he ached for romance; but\r\nromance passed him by. The ladies of the court ignored his existence,\r\nwhile, as for those wandering damsels who came periodically to Camelot\r\nto complain of the behaviour of dragons, giants, and the like, and to\r\nask permission of the king to take a knight back with them to fight\r\ntheir cause (just as, nowadays, one goes out and calls a policeman), he\r\nsimply had no chance. The choice always fell on Lancelot or some other\r\npopular favourite.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tournament was followed by a feast. In those brave days almost\r\neverything was followed by a feast. The scene was gay and animated.\r\nFair ladies, brave knights, churls, varlets, squires, scurvy knaves,\r\nmen-at-arms, malapert rogues--all were merry. All save Agravaine. He\r\nsat silent and moody. To the jests of Dagonet he turned a deaf ear. And\r\nwhen his neighbour, Sir Kay, arguing with Sir Percivale on current\r\nform, appealed to him to back up his statement that Sir Gawain, though\r\na workman-like middle-weight, lacked the punch, he did not answer,\r\nthough the subject was one on which he held strong views. He sat on,\r\nbrooding.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there, a man-at-arms entered the hall.\r\n\r\n'Your majesty,' he cried, 'a damsel in distress waits without.'\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of excitement and interest.\r\n\r\n'Show her in,' said the king, beaming.\r\n\r\nThe man-at-arms retired. Around the table the knights were struggling\r\ninto an upright position in their seats and twirling their moustaches.\r\nAgravaine alone made no movement. He had been through this sort of\r\nthing so often. What were distressed damsels to him? His whole\r\ndemeanour said, as plainly as if he had spoken the words, 'What's the\r\nuse?'\r\n\r\nThe crowd at the door parted, and through the opening came a figure at\r\nthe sight of whom the expectant faces of the knights turned pale with\r\nconsternation. For the new-comer was quite the plainest girl those\r\nstately halls had ever seen. Possibly the only plain girl they had ever\r\nseen, for no instance is recorded in our authorities of the existence\r\nat that period of any such.\r\n\r\nThe knights gazed at her blankly. Those were the grand old days of\r\nchivalry, when a thousand swords would leap from their scabbards to\r\nprotect defenceless woman, if she were beautiful. The present seemed\r\nsomething in the nature of a special case, and nobody was quite certain\r\nas to the correct procedure.\r\n\r\nAn awkward silence was broken by the king.\r\n\r\n'Er--yes?' he said.\r\n\r\nThe damsel halted.\r\n\r\n'Your majesty,' she cried, 'I am in distress. I crave help!'\r\n\r\n'Just so,' said the king, uneasily, flashing an apprehensive glance at\r\nthe rows of perturbed faces before him. 'Just _so_. What--er--what is\r\nthe exact nature of the--ah--trouble? Any assistance these gallant\r\nknights can render will, I am sure, be--ah--eagerly rendered.'\r\n\r\nHe looked imploringly at the silent warriors. As a rule, this speech\r\nwas the signal for roars of applause. But now there was not even a\r\nmurmur.\r\n\r\n'I may say enthusiastically,' he added.\r\n\r\nNot a sound.\r\n\r\n'Precisely,' said the king, ever tactful. 'And now--you were saying?'\r\n\r\n'I am Yvonne, the daughter of Earl Dorm of the Hills,' said the damsel,\r\n'and my father has sent me to ask protection from a gallant knight\r\nagainst a fiery dragon that ravages the country-side.'\r\n\r\n'A dragon, gentlemen,' said the king, aside. It was usually a safe\r\ndraw. Nothing pleased the knight of that time more than a brisk bout\r\nwith a dragon. But now the tempting word was received in silence.\r\n\r\n'Fiery,' said the king.\r\n\r\nSome more silence.\r\n\r\nThe king had recourse to the direct appeal. 'Sir Gawain, this Court\r\nwould be greatly indebted to you if--'\r\n\r\nSir Gawain said he had strained a muscle at the last tournament.\r\n\r\n'Sir Pelleas.'\r\n\r\nThe king's voice was growing flat with consternation. The situation was\r\nunprecedented.\r\n\r\nSir Pelleas said he had an ingrowing toe-nail.\r\n\r\nThe king's eye rolled in anguish around the table. Suddenly it stopped.\r\nIt brightened. His look of dismay changed to one of relief.\r\n\r\nA knight had risen to his feet. It was Agravaine.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' said the king, drawing a deep breath.\r\n\r\nSir Agravaine gulped. He was feeling more nervous than he had ever felt\r\nin his life. Never before had he risen to volunteer his services in a\r\nmatter of this kind, and his state of mind was that of a small boy\r\nabout to recite his first piece of poetry.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the consciousness that every eye, except one of Sir\r\nBalin's which had been closed in the tournament that afternoon, was\r\nupon him. What made him feel like a mild gentleman in a post-office who\r\nhas asked the lady assistant if she will have time to attend to him\r\nsoon and has caught her eye, was the fact that he thought he had\r\nobserved the damsel Yvonne frown as he rose. He groaned in spirit. This\r\ndamsel, he felt, wanted the proper goods or none at all. She might not\r\nbe able to get Sir Lancelot or Sir Galahad; but she was not going to be\r\nsatisfied with a half-portion.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Sir Agravaine had fallen in love at first sight. The\r\nmoment he had caught a glimpse of the damsel Yvonne, he loved her\r\ndevotedly. To others she seemed plain and unattractive. To him she was\r\na Queen of Beauty. He was amazed at the inexplicable attitude of the\r\nknights around him. He had expected them to rise in a body to clamour\r\nfor the chance of assisting this radiant vision. He could hardly\r\nbelieve, even now, that he was positively the only starter.\r\n\r\n'This is Sir Agravaine the Dolorous,' said the king to the damsel.\r\n'Will you take him as your champion?'\r\n\r\nAgravaine held his breath. But all was well. The damsel bowed.\r\n\r\n'Then, Sir Agravaine,' said the king, 'perhaps you had better have your\r\ncharger sent round at once. I imagine that the matter is pressing--time\r\nand--er--dragons wait for no man.'\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Agravaine, still dazed, was jogging along to the\r\nhills, with the damsel by his side.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before either of them spoke. The damsel seemed\r\npreoccupied, and Agravaine's mind was a welter of confused thoughts,\r\nthe most prominent of which and the one to which he kept returning\r\nbeing the startling reflection that he, who had pined for romance so\r\nlong, had got it now in full measure.\r\n\r\nA dragon! Fiery withal. Was he absolutely certain that he was capable\r\nof handling an argument with a fiery dragon? He would have given much\r\nfor a little previous experience of this sort of thing. It was too late\r\nnow, but he wished he had had the forethought to get Merlin to put up a\r\nmagic prescription for him, rendering him immune to dragon-bites. But\r\ndid dragons bite? Or did they whack at you with their tails? Or just\r\nblow fire?\r\n\r\nThere were a dozen such points that he would have liked to have settled\r\nbefore starting. It was silly to start out on a venture of this sort\r\nwithout special knowledge. He had half a mind to plead a forgotten\r\nengagement and go straight back.\r\n\r\nThen he looked at the damsel, and his mind was made up. What did death\r\nmatter if he could serve her?\r\n\r\nHe coughed. She came out of her reverie with a start.\r\n\r\n'This dragon, now?' said Agravaine.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the damsel did not reply. 'A fearsome worm, Sir Knight,'\r\nshe said at length. 'It raveneth by day and by night. It breathes fire\r\nfrom its nostrils.'\r\n\r\n'Does it!' said Agravaine. '_Does_ it! You couldn't give some\r\nidea what it looks like, what kind of _size_ it is?'\r\n\r\n'Its body is as thick as ten stout trees, and its head touches the\r\nclouds.'\r\n\r\n'Does it!' said Agravaine thoughtfully. '_Does_ it!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Sir Knight, I pray you have a care.'\r\n\r\n'I will,' said Agravaine. And he had seldom said anything more\r\nfervently. The future looked about as bad as it could be. Any hopes\r\nhe may have entertained that this dragon might turn out to\r\nbe comparatively small and inoffensive were dissipated. This was\r\nplainly no debilitated wreck of a dragon, its growth stunted by\r\nexcessive-fire-breathing. A body as thick as ten stout trees! He would\r\nnot even have the melancholy satisfaction of giving the creature\r\nindigestion. For all the impression he was likely to make on that vast\r\ninterior, he might as well be a salted almond.\r\n\r\nAs they were speaking, a dim mass on the skyline began to take shape.\r\n\r\n'Behold!' said the damsel. 'My father's castle.' And presently they\r\nwere riding across the drawbridge and through the great gate, which\r\nshut behind them with a clang.\r\n\r\nAs they dismounted a man came out through a door at the farther end of\r\nthe courtyard.\r\n\r\n'Father,' said Yvonne, 'this is the gallant knight Sir Agravaine, who\r\nhas come to--' it seemed to Agravaine that she hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n'To tackle our dragon?' said the father. 'Excellent. Come right in.'\r\n\r\nEarl Dorm of the Hills, was a small, elderly man, with what Agravaine\r\nconsidered a distinctly furtive air about him. His eyes were too close\r\ntogether, and he was over-lavish with a weak, cunning smile. Even\r\nAgravaine, who was in the mood to like the whole family, if possible,\r\nfor Yvonne's sake, could not help feeling that appearances were against\r\nthis particular exhibit. He might have a heart of gold beneath the\r\noutward aspect of a confidence-trick expert whose hobby was dog-stealing,\r\nbut there was no doubt that his exterior did not inspire a genial glow\r\nof confidence.\r\n\r\n'Very good of you to come,' said the earl.\r\n\r\n'It's a pleasure,' said Agravaine. 'I have been hearing all about the\r\ndragon.'\r\n\r\n'A great scourge,' agreed his host. 'We must have a long talk about it\r\nafter dinner.'\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in those days in the stately homes of England for the\r\nwhole strength of the company to take their meals together. The guests\r\nsat at the upper table, the ladies in a gallery above them, while the\r\nusual drove of men-at-arms, archers, malapert rogues, varlets, scurvy\r\nknaves, scullions, and plug-uglies attached to all medieval households,\r\nsquashed in near the door, wherever they could find room.\r\n\r\nThe retinue of Earl Dorm was not strong numerically--the household\r\nbeing, to judge from appearances, one that had seen better days; but it\r\nstruck Agravaine that what it lacked in numbers it made up in\r\ntoughness. Among all those at the bottom of the room there was not one\r\nwhom it would have been agreeable to meet alone in a dark alley. Of\r\nall those foreheads not one achieved a height of more than one point\r\nnought four inches. A sinister collection, indeed, and one which,\r\nAgravaine felt, should have been capable of handling without his\r\nassistance any dragon that ever came into the world to stimulate the\r\nasbestos industry.\r\n\r\nHe was roused from his reflections by the voice of his host.\r\n\r\n'I hope you are not tired after your journey, Sir Agravaine? My little\r\ngirl did not bore you, I trust? We are very quiet folk here. Country\r\nmice. But we must try to make your visit interesting.'\r\n\r\nAgravaine felt that the dragon might be counted upon to do that. He\r\nsaid as much.\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes, the dragon,' said Earl Dorm, 'I was forgetting the dragon. I\r\nwant to have a long talk with you about that dragon. Not now. Later\r\non.'\r\n\r\nHis eye caught Agravaine's, and he smiled that weak, cunning smile of\r\nhis. And for the first time the knight was conscious of a curious\r\nfeeling that all was not square and aboveboard in this castle. A\r\nconviction began to steal over him that in some way he was being played\r\nwith, that some game was afoot which he did not understand, that--in a\r\nword--there was dirty work at the cross-roads.\r\n\r\nThere was a touch of mystery in the atmosphere which made him vaguely\r\nuneasy. When a fiery dragon is ravaging the country-side to such an\r\nextent that the S.O.S. call has been sent out to the Round Table, a\r\nknight has a right to expect the monster to be the main theme of\r\nconversation. The tendency on his host's part was apparently to avoid\r\ntouching on the subject at all. He was vague and elusive; and the one\r\ntopic on which an honest man is not vague and elusive is that of fiery\r\ndragons. It was not right. It was as if one should phone for the police\r\nand engage them, on arrival, in a discussion on the day's football\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nA wave of distrust swept over Agravaine. He had heard stories of robber\r\nchiefs who lured strangers into their strongholds and then held them\r\nprisoners while the public nervously dodged their anxious friends who\r\nhad formed subscription lists to make up the ransom. Could this be such\r\na case? The man certainly had an evasive manner and a smile which would\r\nhave justified any jury in returning a verdict without leaving the box.\r\nOn the other hand, there was Yvonne. His reason revolted against the\r\nidea of that sweet girl being a party to any such conspiracy.\r\n\r\nNo, probably it was only the Earl's unfortunate manner. Perhaps he\r\nsuffered from some muscular weakness of the face which made him smile\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he certainly wished that he had not allowed himself to be\r\ndeprived of his sword and armour. At the time it had seemed to him that\r\nthe Earl's remark that the latter needed polishing and the former\r\nstropping betrayed only a kindly consideration for his guest's well-being.\r\nNow, it had the aspect of being part of a carefully-constructed plot.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand--here philosophy came to his rescue--if anybody did\r\nmean to start anything, his sword and armour might just as well not be\r\nthere. Any one of those mammoth low-brows at the door could eat him,\r\narmour and all.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his meal, uneasy but resigned.\r\n\r\nDinner at Earl Dorm's was no lunch-counter scuffle. It started early\r\nand finished late. It was not till an advanced hour that Agravaine was\r\nconducted to his room.\r\n\r\nThe room which had been allotted to him was high up in the eastern\r\ntower. It was a nice room, but to one in Agravaine's state of\r\nsuppressed suspicion a trifle too solidly upholstered. The door was of\r\nthe thickest oak, studded with iron nails. Iron bars formed a neat\r\npattern across the only window.\r\n\r\nHardly had Agravaine observed these things when the door opened, and\r\nbefore him stood the damsel Yvonne, pale of face and panting for\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nShe leaned against the doorpost and gulped.\r\n\r\n'Fly!' she whispered.\r\n\r\nReader, if you had come to spend the night in the lonely castle of a\r\nperfect stranger with a shifty eye and a rogues' gallery smile, and on\r\nretiring to your room had found the door kick-proof and the window\r\nbarred, and if, immediately after your discovery of these phenomena, a\r\nwhite-faced young lady had plunged in upon you and urged you to\r\nimmediate flight, wouldn't that jar you?\r\n\r\nIt jarred Agravaine.\r\n\r\n'Eh?' he cried.\r\n\r\n'Fly! Fly, Sir Knight.'\r\n\r\nAnother footstep sounded in the passage. The damsel gave a startled\r\nlook over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n'And what's all this?'\r\n\r\nEarl Dorm appeared in the dim-lit corridor. His voice had a nasty\r\ntinkle in it.\r\n\r\n'Your--your daughter,' said Agravaine, hurriedly, 'was just telling me\r\nthat breakfast would--'\r\n\r\nThe sentence remained unfinished. A sudden movement of the earl's hand,\r\nand the great door banged in his face. There came the sound of a bolt\r\nshooting into its socket. A key turned in the lock. He was trapped.\r\n\r\nOutside, the earl had seized his daughter by the wrist and was\r\nadministering a paternal cross-examination.\r\n\r\n'What were you saying to him?'\r\n\r\nYvonne did not flinch.\r\n\r\n'I was bidding him fly.'\r\n\r\n'If he wants to leave this castle,' said the earl, grimly, 'he'll have\r\nto.'\r\n\r\n'Father,' said Yvonne,' I can't.'\r\n\r\n'Can't what?'\r\n\r\n'I can't.'\r\n\r\nHis grip on her wrist tightened. From the other side of the door came\r\nthe muffled sound of blows on the solid oak. 'Oh?' said Earl Dorm.\r\n'You can't, eh? Well, listen to me. You've got to. Do you understand? I\r\nadmit he might be better-looking, but--'\r\n\r\n'Father, I love him.'\r\n\r\nHe released her wrist, and stared at her in the uncertain light.\r\n\r\n'You love him!'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Then what--? Why? Well, I never did understand women,' he said at\r\nlast, and stumped off down the passage.\r\n\r\nWhile this cryptic conversation was in progress, Agravaine, his worst\r\napprehensions realized, was trying to batter down the door. After a few\r\nmoments, however, he realized the futility of his efforts, and sat down\r\non the bed to think.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of forfeiting the reader's respect, it must be admitted\r\nthat his first emotion was one of profound relief. If he was locked up\r\nlike this, it must mean that that dragon story was fictitious, and that\r\nall danger was at an end of having to pit his inexperience against a\r\nravening monster who had spent a lifetime devouring knights. He had\r\nnever liked the prospect, though he had been prepared to go through\r\nwith it, and to feel that it was definitely cancelled made up for a\r\ngood deal.\r\n\r\nHis mind next turned to his immediate future. What were they going to\r\ndo with him? On this point he felt tolerably comfortable. This\r\nimprisonment could mean nothing more than that he would be compelled to\r\ndisgorge a ransom. This did not trouble him. He was rich, and, now that\r\nthe situation had been switched to a purely business basis, he felt\r\nthat he could handle it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, there was nothing to be gained by sitting up, so he went\r\nto bed, like a good philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe sun was pouring through the barred window when he was awoken by the\r\nentrance of a gigantic figure bearing food and drink.\r\n\r\nHe recognized him as one of the scurvy knaves who had dined at the\r\nbottom of the room the night before--a vast, beetle-browed fellow with\r\na squint, a mop of red hair, and a genius for silence. To Agravaine's\r\nattempts to engage him in conversation he replied only with grunts, and\r\nin a short time left the room, closing and locking the door behind him.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded at dusk by another of about the same size and\r\nugliness, and with even less conversational _elan_. This one did\r\nnot even grunt.\r\n\r\nSmall-talk, it seemed, was not an art cultivated in any great measure\r\nby the lower orders in the employment of Earl Dorm.\r\n\r\nThe next day passed without incident. In the morning the strabismic\r\nplug-ugly with the red hair brought him food and drink, while in the\r\nevening the non-grunter did the honours. It was a peaceful life, but\r\ntending towards monotony, and Agravaine was soon in the frame of mind\r\nwhich welcomes any break in the daily round.\r\n\r\nHe was fortunate enough to get it.\r\n\r\nHe had composed himself for sleep that night, and was just dropping\r\ncomfortably off, when from the other side of the door he heard the\r\nsound of angry voices.\r\n\r\nIt was enough to arouse him. On the previous night silence had reigned.\r\nEvidently something out of the ordinary was taking place.\r\n\r\nHe listened intently and distinguished words.\r\n\r\n'Who was it I did see thee coming down the road with?'\r\n\r\n'Who was it thou didst see me coming down the road with?'\r\n\r\n'Aye, who was it I did see thee coming down the road with?'\r\n\r\n'Who dost thou think thou art?'\r\n\r\n'Who do I think that I am?'\r\n\r\n'Aye, who dost thou think thou art?'\r\n\r\nAgravaine could make nothing of it. As a matter of fact, he was hearing\r\nthe first genuine cross-talk that had ever occurred in those dim,\r\npre-music-hall days. In years to come dialogue on these lines was to\r\nbe popular throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain. But\r\ntill then it had been unknown.\r\n\r\nThe voices grew angrier. To an initiated listener it would have been\r\nplain that in a short while words would be found inadequate and the\r\ndagger, that medieval forerunner of the slap-stick, brought into play.\r\nBut to Agravaine, all inexperienced, it came as a surprise when\r\nsuddenly with a muffled thud two bodies fell against the door. There\r\nwas a scuffling noise, some groans, and then silence.\r\n\r\nAnd then with amazement he heard the bolt shoot back and a key grate in\r\nthe keyhole.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open. It was dark outside, but Agravaine could\r\ndistinguish a female form, and, beyond, a shapeless mass which he took\r\ncorrectly to be the remains of the two plug-uglies.\r\n\r\n'It is I, Yvonne,' said a voice.\r\n\r\n'What is it? What has been happening?'\r\n\r\n'It was I. I set them against each other. They both loved one of the\r\nkitchen-maids. I made them jealous. I told Walt privily that she had\r\nfavoured Dickon, and Dickon privily that she loved Walt. And now--'\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the shapeless heap, and shuddered. Agravaine nodded.\r\n\r\n'No wedding-bells for her,' he said, reverently.\r\n\r\n'And I don't care. I did it to save you. But come! We are wasting time.\r\nCome! I will help you to escape.'\r\n\r\nA man who has been shut up for two days in a small room is seldom slow\r\noff the mark when a chance presents itself of taking exercise.\r\nAgravaine followed without a word, and together they crept down the\r\ndark staircase until they had reached the main hall. From somewhere in\r\nthe distance came the rhythmic snores of scurvy knaves getting their\r\neight hours.\r\n\r\nSoftly Yvonne unbolted a small door, and, passing through it, Agravaine\r\nfound himself looking up at the stars, while the great walls of the\r\ncastle towered above him.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye,' said Yvonne.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. For the first time Agravaine found himself\r\nexamining the exact position of affairs. After his sojourn in the\r\nguarded room, freedom looked very good to him. But freedom meant\r\nparting from Yvonne.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the sky and he looked at the castle walls, and he took a\r\nstep back towards the door.\r\n\r\n'I'm not so sure I want to go,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Oh, fly! Fly, Sir Knight!' she cried.\r\n\r\n'You don't understand,' said Agravaine. 'I don't want to seem to be\r\nsaying anything that might be interpreted as in the least derogatory to\r\nyour father in any way whatever, but without prejudice, surely he is\r\njust a plain, ordinary brigand? I mean it's only a question of a\r\nransom? And I don't in the least object--'\r\n\r\n'No, no, no.' Her voice trembled. 'He would ask no ransom.'\r\n\r\n'Don't tell me he kidnaps people just as a hobby!'\r\n\r\n'You don't understand. He--No, I cannot tell you. Fly!'\r\n\r\n'What don't I understand?'\r\n\r\nShe was silent. Then she began to speak rapidly. 'Very well. I will\r\ntell you. Listen. My father had six children, all daughters. We were\r\npoor. We had to stay buried in this out-of-the-way spot. We saw no one.\r\nIt seemed impossible that any of us should ever marry. My father was in\r\ndespair. Then he said, \"If we cannot get to town, the town must come to\r\nus.\" So he sent my sister Yseult to Camelot to ask the king to let us\r\nhave a knight to protect us against a giant with three heads. There was\r\nno giant, but she got the knight. It was Sir Sagramore. Perhaps you\r\nknew him?'\r\n\r\nAgravaine nodded. He began to see daylight.\r\n\r\n'My sister Yseult was very beautiful. After the first day Sir Sagramore\r\nforgot all about the giant, and seemed to want to do nothing else\r\nexcept have Yseult show him how to play cat's cradle. They were married\r\ntwo months later, and my father sent my sister Elaine to Camelot to\r\nask for a knight to protect us against a wild unicorn.'\r\n\r\n'And who bit?' asked Agravaine, deeply interested.\r\n\r\n'Sir Malibran of Devon. They were married within three weeks, and my\r\nfather--I can't go on. You understand now.'\r\n\r\n'I understand the main idea,' said Agravaine. 'But in my case--'\r\n\r\n'You were to marry me,' said Yvonne. Her voice was quiet and cold, but\r\nshe was quivering.\r\n\r\nAgravaine was conscious of a dull, heavy weight pressing on his heart.\r\nHe had known his love was hopeless, but even hopelessness is the better\r\nfor being indefinite. He understood now.\r\n\r\n'And you naturally want to get rid of me before it can happen,' he\r\nsaid. 'I don't wonder. I'm not vain... Well, I'll go. I knew I had no\r\nchance. Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nHe turned. She stopped him with a sharp cry.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean? You cannot wish to stay now? I am saving you.'\r\n\r\n'Saving me! I have loved you since the moment you entered the Hall at\r\nCamelot,' said Agravaine.\r\n\r\nShe drew in her breath.\r\n\r\n'You--you love me!'\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in the starlight. She held out her hands.\r\n\r\n'Agravaine!'\r\n\r\nShe drooped towards him, and he gathered her into his arms. For a\r\nnovice, he did it uncommonly well.\r\n\r\nIt was about six months later that Agravaine, having ridden into the\r\nforest, called upon a Wise Man at his cell.\r\n\r\nIn those days almost anyone who was not a perfect bonehead could set up\r\nas a Wise Man and get away with it. All you had to do was to live in a\r\nforest and grow a white beard. This particular Wise Man, for a wonder,\r\nhad a certain amount of rude sagacity. He listened carefully to what\r\nthe knight had to say.\r\n\r\n'It has puzzled me to such an extent,' said Agravaine, 'that I felt\r\nthat I must consult a specialist. You see me. Take a good look at me.\r\nWhat do you think of my personal appearance? You needn't hesitate. It's\r\nworse than that. I am the ugliest man in England.'\r\n\r\n'Would you go as far as that?' said the Wise Man, politely.\r\n\r\n'Farther. And everybody else thinks so. Everybody except my wife. She\r\ntells me that I am a model of manly beauty. You know Lancelot? Well,\r\nshe says I have Lancelot whipped to a custard. What do you make of\r\nthat? And here's another thing. It is perfectly obvious to me that my\r\nwife is one of the most beautiful creatures in existence. I have seen\r\nthem all, and I tell you that she stands alone. She is literally\r\nmarooned in Class A, all by herself. Yet she insists that she is plain.\r\nWhat do you make of it?'\r\n\r\nThe Wise Man stroked his beard.\r\n\r\n'My son,' he said, 'the matter is simple. True love takes no account of\r\nlooks.'\r\n\r\n'No?' said Agravaine.\r\n\r\n'You two are affinities. Therefore, to you the outward aspect is nothing.\r\nPut it like this. Love is a thingummybob who what-d'you-call-its.'\r\n\r\n'I'm beginning to see,' said Agravaine.\r\n\r\n'What I meant was this. Love is a wizard greater than Merlin. He plays\r\nodd tricks with the eyesight.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Agravaine.\r\n\r\n'Or, put it another way. Love is a sculptor greater than Praxiteles. He\r\ntakes an unsightly piece of clay and moulds it into a thing divine.'\r\n\r\n'I get you,' said Agravaine.\r\n\r\nThe Wise Man began to warm to his work.\r\n\r\n'Or shall we say--'\r\n\r\n'I think I must be going,' said Agravaine. 'I promised my wife I would\r\nbe back early.'\r\n\r\n'We might put it--' began the Wise Man perseveringly.\r\n\r\n'I understand,' said Agravaine, hurriedly. 'I quite see now. Good-bye.'\r\n\r\nThe Wise Man sighed resignedly.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, Sir Knight,' he said. 'Good-bye. Pay at ye desk.'\r\n\r\nAnd Agravaine rode on his way marvelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOAL-KEEPER AND THE PLUTOCRAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty in writing a story is to convey to the reader\r\nclearly yet tersely the natures and dispositions of one's leading\r\ncharacters. Brevity, brevity--that is the cry. Perhaps, after all, the\r\nplay-bill style is the best. In this drama of love, football\r\n(Association code), and politics, then, the principals are as follows,\r\nin their order of entry:\r\n\r\nISABEL RACKSTRAW (an angel).\r\n\r\nTHE HON. CLARENCE TRESILLIAN (a Greek god).\r\n\r\nLADY RUNNYMEDE (a proud old aristocrat).\r\n\r\nMR RACKSTRAW (a multi-millionaire City man and Radical politician).\r\n\r\nMore about Clarence later. For the moment let him go as a Greek god.\r\nThere were other sides, too, to Mr Rackstraw's character, but for the\r\nmoment let him go as a multi-millionaire City man and Radical\r\npolitician. Not that it is satisfactory; it is too mild. The Radical\r\npolitics of other Radical politicians were as skim-milk to the Radical\r\npolitics of Radical Politician Rackstraw. Where Mr Lloyd George\r\nreferred to the House of Lords as blithering backwoodsmen and asinine\r\nanachronisms, Mr Rackstraw scorned to be so guarded in his speech. He\r\ndid not mince his words. His attitude towards a member of the peerage\r\nwas that of the terrier to the perambulating cat.\r\n\r\nIt was at a charity bazaar that Isabel and Clarence first met. Isabel\r\nwas presiding over the Billiken, Teddy-bear, and Fancy Goods stall.\r\nThere she stood, that slim, radiant girl, bouncing Ardent Youth out of\r\nits father's hard--earned with a smile that alone was nearly worth the\r\nmoney, when she observed, approaching, the handsomest man she had ever\r\nseen. It was--this is not one of those mystery stories--it was\r\nClarence Tresillian. Over the heads of the bevy of gilded youths who\r\nclustered round the stall their eyes met. A thrill ran through Isabel.\r\nShe dropped her eyes. The next moment Clarence had made his spring; the\r\ngilded youths had shredded away like a mist, and he was leaning towards\r\nher, opening negotiations for the purchase of a yellow Teddy-bear at\r\nsixteen times its face value.\r\n\r\nHe returned at intervals during the afternoon. Over the second Teddy-bear\r\nthey became friendly, over the third intimate. He proposed as she was\r\nwrapping up the fourth golliwog, and she gave him her heart and the\r\nparcel simultaneously. At six o'clock, carrying four Teddy-bears, seven\r\nphotograph frames, five golliwogs, and a billiken, Clarence went home\r\nto tell the news to his parents.\r\n\r\nClarence, when not at the University, lived with his father and mother\r\nin Belgrave Square. His mother had been a Miss Trotter, of Chicago, and\r\nit was on her dowry that the Runnymedes contrived to make both ends\r\nmeet. For a noble family they were in somewhat straitened circumstances\r\nfinancially. They lived, simply and without envy of their rich\r\nfellow-citizens, on their hundred thousand pounds a year. They asked no\r\nmore. It enabled them to entertain on a modest scale. Clarence had been\r\nable to go to Oxford; his elder brother, Lord Staines, into the Guards.\r\nThe girls could buy an occasional new frock. On the whole, they were a\r\nthoroughly happy, contented English family of the best sort. Mr Trotter,\r\nit is true, was something of a drawback. He was a rugged old tainted\r\nmillionaire of the old school, with a fondness for shirt-sleeves and a\r\ntendency to give undue publicity to toothpicks. But he had been made to\r\nunderstand at an early date that the dead-line for him was the farther\r\nshore of the Atlantic Ocean, and he now gave little trouble.\r\n\r\nHaving dressed for dinner, Clarence proceeded to the library, where he\r\nfound his mother in hysterics and his father in a state of collapse on\r\nthe sofa. Clarence was too well-bred to make any comment. A true\r\nRunnymede, he affected to notice nothing, and, picking up the evening\r\npaper, began to read. The announcement of his engagement could be\r\npostponed to a more suitable time.\r\n\r\n'Clarence!' whispered a voice from the sofa.\r\n\r\n'Yes, father?'\r\n\r\nThe silver-haired old man gasped for utterance.\r\n\r\n'I've lost my little veto,' he said, brokenly, at length.\r\n\r\n'Where did you see it last?' asked Clarence, ever practical.\r\n\r\n'It's that fellow Rackstraw!' cried the old man, in feeble rage. 'That\r\nbounder Rackstraw! He's the man behind it all. The robber!'\r\n\r\n'Clarence!'\r\n\r\nIt was his mother who spoke. Her voice seemed to rip the air into a\r\nmillion shreds and stamp on them. There are few things more terrible\r\nthan a Chicago voice raised in excitement or anguish.\r\n\r\n'Mother?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind your pop and his old veto. He didn't know he had one till\r\nthe paper said he'd lost it. You listen to me. Clarence, we are\r\nruined.'\r\n\r\nClarence looked at her inquiringly.\r\n\r\n'Ruined much?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Bed-rock,' said his mother. 'If we have sixty thousand dollars a year\r\nafter this, it's all we shall have.'\r\n\r\nA low howl escaped from the stricken old man on the sofa.\r\n\r\nClarence betrayed no emotion.\r\n\r\n'Ah,' he said, calmly. 'How did it happen?'\r\n\r\n'I've just had a cable from Chicago, from your grand-pop. He's been\r\ntrying to corner wheat. He always was an impulsive old gazook.'\r\n\r\n'But surely,' said Clarence, a dim recollection of something he had\r\nheard or read somewhere coming to him, 'isn't cornering wheat a rather\r\nprofitable process?'\r\n\r\n'Sure,' said his mother. 'Sure it is. I guess dad's try at cornering\r\nwheat was about the most profitable thing that ever happened--to the\r\nother fellows. It seems like they got busy and clubbed fifty-seven\r\nvarieties of Hades out of your old grand-pop. He's got to give up a lot\r\nof his expensive habits, and one of them is sending money to us. That's\r\nhow it is.'\r\n\r\n'And on top of that, mind you,' moaned Lord Runnymede, 'I lose my\r\nlittle veto. It's bitter--bitter.'\r\n\r\nClarence lit a cigarette and drew at it thoughtfully. 'I don't see how\r\nwe're going to manage on twelve thousand quid a year,' he said.\r\n\r\nHis mother crisply revised his pronouns.\r\n\r\n'We aren't,' she said. 'You've got to get out and hustle.'\r\n\r\nClarence looked at her blankly.\r\n\r\n'Me?'\r\n\r\n'You.'\r\n\r\n'Work?'\r\n\r\n'Work.'\r\n\r\nClarence drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n'Work? Well, of course, mind you, fellows _do_ work,' he went on,\r\nthoughtfully. 'I was lunching with a man at the Bachelor's only\r\nyesterday who swore he knew a fellow who had met a man whose cousin\r\nworked. But I don't see what I could do, don't you know.'\r\n\r\nHis father raised himself on the sofa.\r\n\r\n'Haven't I given you the education of an English gentleman?'\r\n\r\n'That's the difficulty,' said Clarence.\r\n\r\n'Can't you do _anything_?' asked his mother.\r\n\r\n'Well, I can play footer. By Jove, I'll sign on as a pro. I'll take a\r\nnew name. I'll call myself Jones. I can get signed on in a minute. Any\r\nclub will jump at me.'\r\n\r\nThis was no idle boast. Since early childhood Clarence had concentrated\r\nhis energies on becoming a footballer, and was now an exceedingly fine\r\ngoal-keeper. It was a pleasing sight to see him, poised on one foot in\r\nthe attitude of a Salome dancer, with one eye on the man with the ball,\r\nthe other gazing coldly on the rest of the opposition forward line,\r\nuncurl abruptly like the main-spring of a watch and stop a hot one.\r\nClarence in goal was the nearest approach to an india-rubber acrobat\r\nand society contortionist to be seen off the music-hall stage. He was,\r\nin brief, hot stuff. He had the goods.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he uttered these momentous words when the butler entered\r\nwith the announcement that he was wanted by a lady on the telephone.\r\n\r\nIt was Isabel, disturbed and fearful.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Clarence,' she cried, 'my precious angel wonder-child, I don't\r\nknow how to begin.'\r\n\r\n'Begin just like that,' said Clarence, approvingly. 'It's topping. You\r\ncan't beat it.'\r\n\r\n'Clarence, a terrible thing has happened. I told papa of our\r\nengagement, and he wouldn't hear of it. He c-called you a a p-p-p--'\r\n\r\n'A what?'\r\n\r\n'A pr-pr-pr--'\r\n\r\n'He's wrong. I'm nothing of the sort. He must be thinking of someone\r\nelse.'\r\n\r\n'A preposterous excrescence on the social cosmos. He doesn't like your\r\nfather being an earl.'\r\n\r\n'A man may be an earl and still a gentleman,' said Clarence, not\r\nwithout a touch of coldness in his voice.\r\n\r\n'I forgot to tell him that. But I don't think it would make any\r\ndifference. He says I shall only marry a man who works.'\r\n\r\n'I am going to work, dearest,' said Clarence. 'I am going to work like a\r\nhorse. Something--I know not what--tells me I shall be rather good at\r\nwork. And one day when I--'\r\n\r\n'Good-bye,' said Isabel, hastily. 'I hear papa coming.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClarence, as he had predicted, found no difficulty in obtaining\r\nemployment. He was signed on at once, under the name of Jones, by\r\nHoundsditch Wednesday, the premier metropolitan club, and embarked at\r\nonce on his new career.\r\n\r\nThe season during which Clarence Tresillian kept goal for Houndsditch\r\nWednesday is destined to live long in the memory of followers of\r\nprofessional football. Probably never in the history of the game has\r\nthere been such persistent and widespread mortality among the more\r\ndistant relatives of office-boys and junior clerks. Statisticians have\r\nestimated that if all the grandmothers alone who perished between the\r\nmonths of September and April that season could have been placed end to\r\nend, they would have reached from Hyde Park Corner to the outskirts of\r\nManchester. And it was Clarence who was responsible for this\r\nholocaust. Previous to the opening of the season sceptics had shaken\r\ntheir heads over the Wednesday's chances in the First League. Other\r\nclubs had bought up the best men in the market, leaving only a mixed\r\nassortment of inferior Scotsmen, Irishmen, and Northcountrymen to\r\nuphold the honour of the London club.\r\n\r\nAnd then, like a meteor, Clarence Tresillian had flashed upon the world\r\nof football. In the opening game he had behaved in the goal-mouth like\r\na Chinese cracker, and exhibited an absolutely impassable defence; and\r\nfrom then onward, except for an occasional check, Houndsditch Wednesday\r\nhad never looked back.\r\n\r\nAmong the spectators who flocked to the Houndsditch ground to watch\r\nClarence perform there appeared week after week a little, grey, dried-up\r\nman, insignificant except for a certain happy choice of language in\r\nmoments of emotion and an enthusiasm far surpassing that of the\r\nordinary spectator. To the trained eye there are subtle distinctions\r\nbetween football enthusiasts. This man belonged to the comparatively\r\nsmall class of those who have football on the cerebrum.\r\n\r\nFate had made Daniel Rackstraw a millionaire and a Radical, but at\r\nheart he was a spectator of football. He never missed a match. His\r\nlibrary of football literature was the finest in the country. His\r\nfootball museum had but one equal, that of Mr Jacob Dodson, of\r\nManchester. Between them the two had cornered, at enormous expense, the\r\ncurio market of the game. It was Rackstraw who had secured the\r\nauthentic pair of boots in which Bloomer had first played for England;\r\nbut it was Dodson who possessed the painted india-rubber ball used by\r\nMeredith when a boy--probably the first thing except a nurse ever\r\nkicked by that talented foot. The two men were friends, as far as rival\r\nconnoisseurs can be friends; and Mr Dodson, when at leisure, would\r\nfrequently pay a visit to Mr Rackstraw's country house, where he would\r\nspend hours gazing wistfully at the Bloomer boots, buoyed up only by\r\nthe thoughts of the Meredith ball at home.\r\n\r\nIsabel saw little of Clarence during the winter months, except from a\r\ndistance. She contented herself with clipping photographs of him from\r\nthe sporting papers. Each was a little more unlike him than the last,\r\nand this lent variety to the collection. Her father marked her new-born\r\nenthusiasm for the game with approval. It had been secretly a great\r\ngrief to the old gentleman that his only child did not know the\r\ndifference between a linesman and an inside right, and, more, did not\r\nseem to care to know. He felt himself drawn closer to her. An\r\nunderstanding, as pleasant as it was new and strange, began to spring\r\nup between parent and child.\r\n\r\nAs for Clarence, how easy it would be to haul up one's slacks to\r\npractically an unlimited extent on the subject of his emotions at this\r\ntime. One can figure him, after the game is over and the gay throng has\r\ndispersed, creeping moodily--but what's the use? Brevity--that is the\r\ncry. Brevity. Let us on.\r\n\r\nThe months sped by; the Cup-ties began, and soon it was evident that\r\nthe Final must be fought out between Houndsditch Wednesday and Mr Jacob\r\nDodson's pet team, Manchester United. With each match the Wednesday\r\nseemed to improve. Clarence was a Gibraltar among goal-keepers.\r\n\r\nThose were delirious days for Daniel Rackstraw. Long before the fourth\r\nround his voice had dwindled to a husky whisper. Deep lines appeared on\r\nhis forehead; for it is an awful thing for a football enthusiast to be\r\ncompelled to applaud, in the very middle of the Cup-ties, purely by\r\nmeans of facial expression. In this time of affliction he found Isabel\r\nan ever-increasing comfort to him. Side by side they would sit, and the\r\nold man's face would lose its drawn look, and light up, as her clear\r\nyoung soprano pealed out over the din, urging this player to shoot,\r\nthat to kick some opponent in the face; or describing the referee in no\r\nuncertain terms as a reincarnation of the late Mr Dick Turpin.\r\n\r\nAnd now the day of the Final at the Crystal Palace approached, and all\r\nEngland was alert, confident of a record-breaking contest. But alas!\r\nHow truly does Epictetus observe: 'We know not what awaiteth us round\r\nthe corner, and the hand that counteth its chickens ere they be hatched\r\noft-times doth but step on the banana-skin.' The prophets who\r\nanticipated a struggle keener than any in football history were\r\ndestined to be proved false.\r\n\r\nIt was not that their judgement of form was at fault. On the run of the\r\nseason's play Houndsditch Wednesday _v_. Manchester United should\r\nhave been the two most evenly-matched teams in the history of the game.\r\nForward, the latter held a slight superiority; but this was balanced by\r\nthe inspired goal-keeping of Clarence Tresillian. Even the keenest\r\nsupporters of either side were not confident. They argued at length,\r\nfiguring out the odds with the aid of stubs of pencils and the backs of\r\nenvelopes, but they were not confident. Out of all those frenzied\r\nmillions two men alone had no doubts. Mr Daniel Rackstraw said that he\r\ndid not desire to be unfair to Manchester United. He wished it to be\r\nclearly understood that in their own class Manchester United might\r\nquite possibly show to considerable advantage. In some rural league,\r\nfor instance, he did not deny that they might sweep all before them.\r\nBut when it came to competing with Houndsditch Wednesday--here words\r\nfailed Mr Rackstraw.\r\n\r\nMr Jacob Dodson, interviewed by the _Manchester Weekly Football\r\nBoot_, stated that his decision, arrived at after a close and\r\ncareful study of the work of both teams, was that Houndsditch Wednesday\r\nhad rather less chance in the forthcoming tourney than a stuffed rat in\r\nthe Battersea Dogs' Home. It was his carefully-considered opinion that\r\nin a contest with the second eleven of a village Church Lads' Brigade,\r\nHoundsditch Wednesday might, with an effort (conceding them that slice\r\nof luck which so often turns the tide of a game), scrape home. But when\r\nit was a question of meeting a team like Manchester United--here Mr\r\nDodson, shrugging his shoulders despairingly, sank back in his chair,\r\nand watchful secretaries brought him round with oxygen.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole country nothing but the approaching match was\r\ndiscussed. Wherever civilization reigned, and in portions of Liverpool,\r\none question alone was on every lip: Who would win? Octogenarians\r\nmumbled it. Infants lisped it. Tired City men, trampled under foot in\r\nthe rush for their tram, asked it of the ambulance attendants who\r\ncarried them to the hospital.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one bright, clear morning, when the birds sang and all Nature\r\nseemed fair and gay, Clarence Tresillian developed mumps.\r\n\r\nLondon was in a ferment. I could have wished to go into details, to\r\ndescribe in crisp, burning sentences the panic that swept like a\r\ntornado through a million homes. A little encouragement, the slightest\r\nsoftening of the editorial austerity and the thing would have been\r\ndone. But no. Brevity. That was the cry. Brevity. Let us on.\r\n\r\nHoundsditch Wednesday met Manchester United at the Crystal Palace, and\r\nfor nearly two hours the sweat of agony trickled unceasingly down the\r\ncorrugated foreheads of the patriots in the stands. The men from\r\nManchester, freed from the fear of Clarence, smiled grim smiles and\r\nproceeded to pile up points. It was in vain that the Houndsditch backs\r\nand halfbacks skimmed like swallows about the field. They could not\r\nkeep the score down. From start to finish Houndsditch were a beaten\r\nside.\r\n\r\nLondon during that black period was a desert. Gloom gripped the City.\r\nIn distant Brixton red-eyed wives faced silently-scowling husbands at\r\nthe evening meal, and the children were sent early to bed. Newsboys\r\ncalled the extras in a whisper.\r\n\r\nFew took the tragedy more nearly to heart than Daniel Rackstraw.\r\nLeaving the ground with the air of a father mourning over some prodigal\r\nson, he encountered Mr Jacob Dodson, of Manchester.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr Dodson was perhaps the slightest bit shy on the finer feelings.\r\nHe should have respected the grief of a fallen foe. He should have\r\nabstained from exulting. But he was in too exhilarated a condition to\r\nbe magnanimous. Sighting Mr Rackstraw, he addressed himself joyously to\r\nthe task of rubbing the thing in. Mr Rackstraw listened in silent\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\n'If we had had Jones--' he said at length.\r\n\r\n'That's what they all say,' whooped Mr Dodson, 'Jones! Who's Jones?'\r\n\r\n'If we had had Jones, we should have--' He paused. An idea had flashed\r\nupon his overwrought mind. 'Dodson,' he said, 'look here. Wait till\r\nJones is well again, and let us play this thing off again for anything\r\nyou like a side in my private park.'\r\n\r\nMr Dodson reflected.\r\n\r\n'You're on,' he said. 'What side bet? A million? Two million? Three?'\r\n\r\nMr Rackstraw shook his head scornfully.\r\n\r\n'A million? Who wants a million? I'll put up my Bloomer boot against\r\nyour Meredith ball. Does that go?'\r\n\r\n'I should say it did,' said Mr Dodson, joyfully. 'I've been wanting\r\nthat boot for years. It's like finding it in one's Christmas stocking.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Mr Rackstraw. 'Then let's get it fixed up.'\r\n\r\nHonestly, it is but a dog's life, that of the short-story writer. I\r\nparticularly wished at this point to introduce a description of Mr\r\nRackstraw's country house and estate, featuring the private football\r\nground with its fringe of noble trees. It would have served a double\r\npurpose, not only charming the lover of nature, but acting as a fine\r\nstimulus to the youth of the country, showing them the sort of home\r\nthey would be able to buy some day if they worked hard and saved their\r\nmoney. But no. You shall have three guesses as to what was the cry. You\r\ngive it up? It was Brevity--brevity! Let us on.\r\n\r\nThe two teams arrived at Mr Rackstraw's house in time for lunch.\r\nClarence, his features once more reduced to their customary\r\nfinely-chiselled proportions, alighted from the automobile with a\r\nswelling heart. Presently he found an opportunity to slip away and\r\nmeet Isabel. I will pass lightly over the meeting of the two lovers.\r\nI will not describe the dewy softness of their eyes, the catching of\r\ntheir breath, their murmured endearments. I could, mind you. It is at\r\njust such descriptions that I am particularly happy. But I have grown\r\ndiscouraged. My spirit is broken. It is enough to say that Clarence had\r\nreached a level of emotional eloquence rarely met with among goal-keepers\r\nof the First League, when Isabel broke from him with a startled\r\nexclamation, and vanished; and, looking over his shoulder, Clarence\r\nobserved Mr Daniel Rackstraw moving towards him.\r\n\r\nIt was evident from the millionaire's demeanour that he had seen\r\nnothing. The look on his face was anxious, but not wrathful. He\r\nsighted Clarence, and hurried up to him.\r\n\r\n'Jones,' he said, 'I've been looking for you. I want a word with you.'\r\n\r\n'A thousand, if you wish it,' said Clarence, courteously.\r\n\r\n'Now, look here,' said Mr Rackstraw. 'I want to explain to you just\r\nwhat this game means to me. Don't run away with the idea I've had you\r\nfellows down to play an exhibition game just to keep me merry and\r\nbright. If Houndsditch wins today, it means that I shall be able to hold\r\nup my head again and look my fellow-man in the face, instead of\r\ncrawling round on my stomach and feeling like a black-beetle under a\r\nsteam-roller. Do you get that?'\r\n\r\n'I do,' replied Clarence.\r\n\r\n'And not only that,' went on the millionaire. 'There's more. I have put\r\nup my Bloomer boot against Mr Dodson's Meredith ball as a side bet. You\r\nunderstand what that means? It means that either you win or my life is\r\nsoured for ever. See?'\r\n\r\n'I have got you,' said Clarence.\r\n\r\n'Good. Then what I wanted to say was this. Today is your day for\r\nkeeping goal as you've never kept goal before. Everything depends on\r\nyou. With you keeping goal like mother used to make it, Houndsditch are\r\nsafe. Otherwise they are completely in the bouillon. It's one thing or\r\nthe other. It's all up to you. Win, and there's four thousand pounds\r\nwaiting for you above what you share with the others.'\r\n\r\nClarence waved his hand deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n'Mr Rackstraw,' he said, 'keep your dross. I care nothing for money.\r\nAll I ask of you,' proceeded Clarence, 'is your consent to my\r\nengagement to your daughter.'\r\n\r\nMr Rackstraw looked sharply at him.\r\n\r\n'Repeat that,' he said. 'I don't think I quite got it.'\r\n\r\n'All I ask is your consent to my engagement to your daughter.'\r\n\r\n'Young man,' said Mr Rackstraw, not without a touch of admiration, 'I\r\nadmire cheek. But there is a limit. That limit you have passed so far\r\nthat you'd need to look for it with a telescope.'\r\n\r\n'You refuse your consent?'\r\n\r\n'I never said you weren't a clever guesser.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\nMr Rackstraw laughed. One of those nasty, sharp, metallic laughs that\r\nhit you like a bullet.\r\n\r\n'How would you support my daughter?'\r\n\r\n'I was thinking that you would help to some extent.'\r\n\r\n'You were, were you?'\r\n\r\n'I was.'\r\n\r\n'Oh?'\r\n\r\nMr Rackstraw emitted another of those laughs.\r\n\r\n'Well,' he said, 'it's off. You can take that as coming from an\r\nauthoritative source. No wedding-bells for you.'\r\n\r\nClarence drew himself up, fire flashing from his eyes and a bitter\r\nsmile curving his expressive lips.\r\n\r\n'And no Meredith ball for you!' he cried.\r\n\r\nMr Rackstraw started as if some strong hand had plunged an auger into\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'What?' he shouted.\r\n\r\nClarence shrugged his superbly-modelled shoulders in silence.\r\n\r\n'Come, come,' said Mr Rackstraw, 'you wouldn't let a little private\r\ndifference like that influence you in a really important thing like\r\nthis football match, would you?'\r\n\r\n'I would.'\r\n\r\n'You would practically blackmail the father of the girl you love?'\r\n\r\n'Every time.'\r\n\r\n'Her white-haired old father?'\r\n\r\n'The colour of his hair would not affect me.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing would move you?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing.'\r\n\r\n'Then, by George, you're just the son-in-law I want. You shall marry\r\nIsabel; and I'll take you into partnership in my business this very\r\nday. I've been looking for a good able-bodied bandit like you for\r\nyears. You make Captain Kidd look like a preliminary three-round bout.\r\nMy boy, we'll be the greatest combination, you and I, that the City has\r\never seen. Shake hands.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment Clarence hesitated. Then his better nature prevailed, and\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n'Mr Rackstraw,' he said, 'I cannot deceive you.'\r\n\r\n'That won't matter,' said the enthusiastic old man. 'I bet you'll be\r\nable to deceive everybody else. I see it in your eye. My boy, we'll be\r\nthe greatest--'\r\n\r\n'My name is not Jones.'\r\n\r\n'Nor is mine. What does that matter?'\r\n\r\n'My name is Tresillian. The Hon. Tresillian. I am the younger son of\r\nthe Earl of Runnymede. To a man of your political views--'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense, nonsense,' said Mr Rackstraw. 'What are political views\r\ncompared with the chance of getting a goal-keeper like you into the\r\nfamily? I remember Isabel saying something to me about you, but I\r\ndidn't know who you were then.'\r\n\r\n'I am a preposterous excrescence on the social cosmos,' said Clarence,\r\neyeing him doubtfully.\r\n\r\n'Then I'll be one too,' cried Mr Rackstraw. 'I own I've set my face\r\nagainst it hitherto, but circumstances alter cases. I'll ring up the\r\nPrime Minister on the phone tomorrow, and buy a title myself.'\r\n\r\nClarence's last scruple was removed. Silently he gripped the old man's\r\nhand, outstretched to meet his.\r\n\r\nLittle remains to be said, but I am going to say it, if it snows. I am\r\nat my best in these tender scenes of idyllic domesticity.\r\n\r\nFour years have passed. Once more we are in the Rackstraw home. A lady\r\nis coming down the stairs, leading by the hand her little son. It is\r\nIsabel. The years have dealt lightly with her. She is still the same\r\nstately, beautiful creature whom I would have described in detail long\r\nago if I had been given half a chance. At the foot of the stairs the\r\nchild stops and points at a small, round object in a glass case.\r\n\r\n'Wah?' he says.\r\n\r\n'That?' said Isabel. 'That is the ball Mr Meredith used to play with\r\nwhen he was a little boy.'\r\n\r\nShe looks at a door on the left of the hall, and puts a finger to her\r\nlip.\r\n\r\n'Hush!' she says. 'We must be quiet. Daddy and grandpa are busy in\r\nthere cornering wheat.'\r\n\r\nAnd softly mother and child go out into the sunlit garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN ALCALA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Alcala, as in most of New York's apartment houses, the schedule of\r\nprices is like a badly rolled cigarette--thick in the middle and thin\r\nat both ends. The rooms half-way up are expensive; some of them almost\r\nas expensive as if Fashion, instead of being gone for ever, were still\r\nlingering. The top rooms are cheap, the ground-floor rooms cheaper\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nCheapest of all was the hall-bedroom. Its furniture was of the\r\nsimplest. It consisted of a chair, another chair, a worn carpet, and a\r\nfolding-bed. The folding-bed had an air of depression and baffled\r\nhopes. For years it had been trying to look like a bookcase in the\r\ndaytime, and now it looked more like a folding-bed than ever. There\r\nwas also a plain deal table, much stained with ink. At this, night\r\nafter night, sometimes far into the morning, Rutherford Maxwell would\r\nsit and write stories. Now and then it happened that one would be a\r\ngood story, and find a market.\r\n\r\nRutherford Maxwell was an Englishman, and the younger son of an\r\nEnglishman; and his lot was the lot of the younger sons all the world\r\nover. He was by profession one of the numerous employees of the New\r\nAsiatic Bank, which has its branches all over the world. It is a sound,\r\ntrustworthy institution, and steady-going relatives would assure\r\nRutherford that he was lucky to have got a berth in it. Rutherford did\r\nnot agree with them. However sound and trustworthy, it was not exactly\r\nromantic. Nor did it err on the side of over-lavishness to those who\r\nserved it. Rutherford's salary was small. So were his prospects--if he\r\nremained in the bank. At a very early date he had registered a vow that\r\nhe would not. And the road that led out of it for him was the uphill\r\nroad of literature.\r\n\r\nHe was thankful for small mercies. Fate had not been over-kind up to\r\nthe present, but at least she had dispatched him to New York, the\r\ncentre of things, where he would have the chance to try, instead of to\r\nsome spot off the map. Whether he won or lost, at any rate he was in\r\nthe ring, and could fight. So every night he sat in Alcala, and wrote.\r\nSometimes he would only try to write, and that was torture.\r\n\r\nThere is never an hour of the day or night when Alcala is wholly\r\nasleep. The middle of the house is a sort of chorus-girl belt, while in\r\nthe upper rooms there are reporters and other nightbirds. Long after he\r\nhad gone to bed, Rutherford would hear footsteps passing his door and\r\nthe sound of voices in the passage. He grew to welcome them. They\r\nseemed to connect him with the outer world. But for them he was alone\r\nafter he had left the office, utterly alone, as it is possible to be\r\nonly in the heart of a great city. Some nights he would hear scraps of\r\nconversations, at rare intervals a name. He used to build up in his\r\nmind identities for the owners of the names. One in particular, Peggy,\r\ngave him much food for thought. He pictured her as bright and\r\nvivacious. This was because she sang sometimes as she passed his door.\r\nShe had been singing when he first heard her name. 'Oh, cut it out,\r\nPeggy,' a girl's voice had said. 'Don't you get enough of that tune at\r\nthe theatre?' He felt that he would like to meet Peggy.\r\n\r\nJune came, and July, making an oven of New York, bringing close,\r\nscorching days and nights when the pen seemed made of lead; and still\r\nRutherford worked on, sipping ice-water, in his shirt-sleeves, and\r\nfilling the sheets of paper slowly, but with a dogged persistence which\r\nthe weather could not kill. Despite the heat, he was cheerful. Things\r\nwere beginning to run his way a little now. A novelette, an airy\r\ntrifle, conceived in days when the thermometer was lower and it was\r\npossible to think, and worked out almost mechanically, had been\r\naccepted by a magazine of a higher standing than those which hitherto\r\nhad shown him hospitality. He began to dream of a holiday in the woods.\r\nThe holiday spirit was abroad. Alcala was emptying itself. It would not\r\nbe long before he too would be able to get away.\r\n\r\nHe was so deep in his thoughts that at first he did not hear the\r\nknocking at the door. But it was a sharp, insistent knocking, and\r\nforced itself upon his attention. He got up and turned the handle.\r\n\r\nOutside in the passage was standing a girl, tall and sleepy-eyed. She\r\nwore a picture-hat and a costume the keynote of which was a certain\r\naggressive attractiveness. There was no room for doubt as to which\r\nparticular brand of scent was her favourite at the moment.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at Rutherford dully. Like Banquo's ghost, she had no\r\nspeculation in her eyes. Rutherford looked at her inquiringly, somewhat\r\nconscious of his shirt-sleeves.\r\n\r\n'Did you knock?' he said, opening, as a man must do, with the\r\ninevitable foolish question.\r\n\r\nThe apparition spoke.\r\n\r\n'Say,' she said, 'got a cigarette?'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid I haven't,' said Rutherford, apologetically. 'I've been\r\nsmoking a pipe. I'm very sorry.'\r\n\r\n'What?' said the apparition.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid I haven't.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' A pause. 'Say, got a cigarette?'\r\n\r\nThe intellectual pressure of the conversation was beginning to be a\r\nlittle too much for Rutherford. Combined with the heat of the night it\r\nmade his head swim.\r\n\r\nHis visitor advanced into the room. Arriving at the table, she began\r\nfiddling with its contents. The pen seemed to fascinate her. She picked\r\nit up and inspected it closely.\r\n\r\n'Say, what d'you call this?' she said.\r\n\r\n'That's a pen,' said Rutherford, soothingly. 'A fountain-pen.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' A pause. 'Say, got a cigarette?'\r\n\r\nRutherford clutched a chair with one hand, and his forehead with the\r\nother. He was in sore straits.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Rescue arrived, not before it was needed. A brisk sound\r\nof footsteps in the passage, and there appeared in the doorway a second\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n'What do you think you're doing, Gladys?' demanded the new-comer. 'You\r\nmustn't come butting into folks' rooms this way. Who's your friend?'\r\n\r\n'My name is Maxwell,' began Rutherford eagerly.\r\n\r\n'What say, Peggy?' said the seeker after cigarettes, dropping a sheet\r\nof manuscript to the floor.\r\n\r\nRutherford looked at the girl in the doorway with interest. So this was\r\nPeggy. She was little, and trim of figure. That was how he had always\r\nimagined her. Her dress was simpler than the other's. The face beneath\r\nthe picture-hat was small and well-shaped, the nose delicately\r\ntip-tilted, the chin determined, the mouth a little wide and suggesting\r\ngood-humour. A pair of grey eyes looked steadily into his before\r\ntransferring themselves to the statuesque being at the table.\r\n\r\n'Don't monkey with the man's inkwell, Gladys. Come along up to bed.'\r\n\r\n'What? Say, got a cigarette?'\r\n\r\n'There's plenty upstairs. Come along.'\r\n\r\nThe other went with perfect docility. At the door she paused, and\r\ninspected Rutherford with a grave stare.\r\n\r\n'Good night, boy!' she said, with haughty condescension.\r\n\r\n'Good night!' said Rutherford.\r\n\r\n'Pleased to have met you. Good night.'\r\n\r\n'Good night!' said Rutherford.\r\n\r\n'Good night!'\r\n\r\n'Come along, Gladys,' said Peggy, firmly.\r\n\r\nGladys went.\r\n\r\nRutherford sat down and dabbed his forehead with his handkerchief,\r\nfeeling a little weak. He was not used to visitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nHe had lit his pipe, and was re-reading his night's work preparatory to\r\nturning in, when there was another knock at the door. This time there\r\nwas no waiting. He was in the state of mind when one hears the smallest\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n'Come in!' he cried.\r\n\r\nIt was Peggy.\r\n\r\nRutherford jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n'Won't you--' he began, pushing the chair forward.\r\n\r\nShe seated herself with composure on the table. She no longer wore the\r\npicture-hat, and Rutherford, looking at her, came to the conclusion\r\nthat the change was an improvement.\r\n\r\n'This'll do for me,' she said. 'Thought I'd just look in. I'm sorry\r\nabout Gladys. She isn't often like that. It's the hot weather.'\r\n\r\n'It is hot,' said Rutherford.\r\n\r\n'You've noticed it? Bully for you! Back to the bench for Sherlock\r\nHolmes. Did Gladys try to shoot herself?'\r\n\r\n'Good heavens, no! Why?'\r\n\r\n'She did once. But I stole her gun, and I suppose she hasn't thought to\r\nget another. She's a good girl really, only she gets like that\r\nsometimes in the hot weather.' She looked round the room for a moment,\r\nthen gazed unwinkingly at Rutherford. 'What did you say your name was?'\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n'Rutherford Maxwell.'\r\n\r\n'Gee! That's going some, isn't it? Wants amputation, a name like that.\r\nI call it mean to give a poor, defenceless kid a cuss-word like--what's\r\nit? Rutherford? I got it--to go through the world with. Haven't you got\r\nsomething shorter--Tom, or Charles or something?'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid not.'\r\n\r\nThe round, grey eyes fixed him again.\r\n\r\n'I shall call you George,' she decided at last.\r\n\r\n'Thanks, I wish you would,' said Rutherford.\r\n\r\n'George it is, then. You can call me Peggy. Peggy Norton's my name.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks, I will.'\r\n\r\n'Say, you're English, aren't you?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Yes. How did you know?'\r\n\r\n'You're so strong on the gratitude thing. It's \"Thanks, thanks,\" all\r\nthe time. Not that I mind it, George.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks. Sorry. I should say, \"Oh, you Peggy!\"'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n'How d'you like New York, George?'\r\n\r\n'Fine--tonight.'\r\n\r\n'Been to Coney?'\r\n\r\n'Not yet.'\r\n\r\n'You should. Say, what do you do, George?'\r\n\r\n'What do I do?'\r\n\r\n'Cut it out, George! Don't answer back as though we were a vaudeville\r\nteam doing a cross-talk act. What do you do? When your boss crowds your\r\nenvelope on to you Saturdays, what's it for?'\r\n\r\n'I'm in a bank.'\r\n\r\n'Like it?'\r\n\r\n'Hate it!'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you quit, then?'\r\n\r\n'Can't afford to. There's money in being in a bank. Not much, it's\r\ntrue, but what there is of it is good.'\r\n\r\n'What are you doing out of bed at this time of night? They don't work\r\nyou all day, do they?'\r\n\r\n'No; they'd like to, but they don't. I have been writing.'\r\n\r\n'Writing what? Say, you don't mind my putting you on the witness-stand,\r\ndo you? If you do, say so, and I'll cut out the District Attorney act\r\nand talk about the weather.'\r\n\r\n'Not a bit, really, I assure you. Please ask as many questions as you\r\nlike.'\r\n\r\n'Guess there's no doubt about your being English, George. We don't have\r\ntime over here to shoot it off like that. If you'd have just said\r\n\"Sure!\" I'd have got a line on your meaning. You don't mind me doing\r\nschool-marm, George, do you? It's all for your good.'\r\n\r\n'Sure,' said Rutherford, with a grin.\r\n\r\nShe smiled approvingly.\r\n\r\n'That's better! You're Little Willie, the Apt Pupil, all right. What\r\nwere we talking about before we switched off on to the educational\r\nrail? I know--about your writing. What were you writing?'\r\n\r\n'A story.'\r\n\r\n'For a paper?'\r\n\r\n'For a magazine.'\r\n\r\n'What! One of the fiction stories about the Gibson hero and the girl\r\nwhose life he saved, like you read?'\r\n\r\n'That's the idea.'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a new interest.\r\n\r\n'Gee, George, who'd have thought it! Fancy you being one of the\r\nhigh-brows! You ought to hang out a sign. You look just ordinary.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks!'\r\n\r\n'I mean as far as the grey matter goes. I didn't mean you were a bad\r\nlooker. You're not. You've got nice eyes, George.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks.'\r\n\r\n'I like the shape of your nose, too.'\r\n\r\n'I say, thanks!'\r\n\r\n'And your hair's just lovely!'\r\n\r\n'I say, really. Thanks awfully!'\r\n\r\nShe eyed him in silence for a moment. Then she burst out:\r\n\r\n'You say you don't like the bank?'\r\n\r\n'I certainly don't.'\r\n\r\n'And you'd like to strike some paying line of business?'\r\n\r\n'Sure.'\r\n\r\n'Then why don't you make your fortune by hiring yourself out to a\r\nmuseum as the biggest human clam in captivity? That's what you are. You\r\nsit there just saying \"Thanks,\" and \"Bai Jawve, thanks awf'lly,\" while\r\na girl's telling you nice things about your eyes and hair, and you\r\ndon't do a thing!'\r\n\r\nRutherford threw back his head and roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry!' he said. 'Slowness is our national failing, you know.'\r\n\r\n'I believe you.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me about yourself. You know all about me, by now. What do you do\r\nbesides brightening up the dull evenings of poor devils of bank-clerks?'\r\n\r\n'Give you three guesses.'\r\n\r\n'Stage?'\r\n\r\n'Gee! You're the human sleuth all right, all right! It's a home-run\r\nevery time when you get your deductive theories unlimbered. Yes,\r\nGeorge; the stage it is. I'm an actorine--one of the pony ballet in\r\n_The Island of Girls_ at the Melody. Seen our show?'\r\n\r\n'Not yet. I'll go tomorrow.'\r\n\r\n'Great! I'll let them know, so that they can have the awning out and\r\nthe red carpet down. It's a cute little piece.'\r\n\r\n'So I've heard.'\r\n\r\n'Well, if I see you in front tomorrow, I'll give you half a smile, so\r\nthat you shan't feel you haven't got your money's worth. Good night,\r\nGeorge!'\r\n\r\n'Good night, Peggy!'\r\n\r\nShe jumped down from the table. Her eye was caught by the photographs\r\non the mantelpiece. She began to examine them.\r\n\r\n'Who are these Willies?' she said, picking up a group.\r\n\r\n'That is the football team of my old school. The lout with the sheepish\r\nsmirk, holding the ball, is myself as I was before the cares of the\r\nworld soured me.'\r\n\r\nHer eye wandered along the mantelpiece, and she swooped down on a\r\ncabinet photograph of a girl.\r\n\r\n'And who's _this_, George?' she cried.\r\n\r\nHe took the photograph from her, and replaced it, with a curious blend\r\nof shyness and defiance, in the very centre of the mantelpiece. For a\r\nmoment he stood looking intently at it, his elbows resting on the\r\nimitation marble.\r\n\r\n'Who is it?' asked Peggy. 'Wake up, George. Who's this?'\r\n\r\nRutherford started.\r\n\r\n'Sorry,' he said. 'I was thinking about something.'\r\n\r\n'I bet you were. You looked like it. Well, who is she?'\r\n\r\n'Eh! Oh, that's a girl.'\r\n\r\nPeggy laughed satirically.\r\n\r\n'Thanks awf'lly, as you would say. I've got eyes, George.'\r\n\r\n'I noticed that,' said Rutherford, smiling. 'Charming ones, too.'\r\n\r\n'Gee! What would she say if she heard you talking like that!'\r\n\r\nShe came a step nearer, looking up at him. Their eyes met.\r\n\r\n'She would say,' said Rutherford, slowly: '\"I know you love me, and I\r\nknow I can trust you, and I haven't the slightest objection to your\r\ntelling Miss Norton the truth about her eyes. Miss Norton is a dear,\r\ngood little sort, one of the best, in fact, and I hope you'll be great\r\npals!\"'\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\n'She'd say that, would she?' said Peggy, at last.\r\n\r\n'She would.'\r\n\r\nPeggy looked at the photograph, and back again at Rutherford.\r\n\r\n'You're pretty fond of her, George, I guess, aren't you?'\r\n\r\n'I am,' said Rutherford, quietly.\r\n\r\n'George.'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'George, she's a pretty good long way away, isn't she?'\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with a curious light in her grey eyes. Rutherford\r\nmet her glance steadily.\r\n\r\n'Not to me,' he said. 'She's here now, and all the time.'\r\n\r\nHe stepped away and picked up the sheaf of papers which he had dropped\r\nat Peggy's entrance. Peggy laughed.\r\n\r\n'Good night, Georgie boy,' she said. 'I mustn't keep you up any more,\r\nor you'll be late in the morning. And what would the bank do then?\r\nSmash or something, I guess. Good night, Georgie! See you again one of\r\nthese old evenings.'\r\n\r\n'Good night, Peggy!'\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind her. He heard her footsteps hesitate, stop, and\r\nthen move quickly on once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nHe saw much of her after this first visit. Gradually it became an\r\nunderstood thing between them that she should look in on her return\r\nfrom the theatre. He grew to expect her, and to feel restless when she\r\nwas late. Once she brought the cigarette-loving Gladys with her, but\r\nthe experiment was not a success. Gladys was languid and rather\r\noverpoweringly refined, and conversation became forced. After that,\r\nPeggy came alone.\r\n\r\nGenerally she found him working. His industry amazed her.\r\n\r\n'Gee, George,' she said one night, sitting in her favourite place on\r\nthe table, from which he had moved a little pile of manuscript to make\r\nroom for her. 'Don't you ever let up for a second? Seems to me you\r\nwrite all the time.'\r\n\r\nRutherford laughed.\r\n\r\n'I'll take a rest,' he said, 'when there's a bit more demand for my\r\nstuff than there is at present. When I'm in the twenty-cents-a-word\r\nclass I'll write once a month, and spend the rest of my time\r\ntravelling.'\r\n\r\nPeggy shook her head.\r\n\r\n'No travelling for mine,' she said. 'Seems to me it's just cussedness\r\nthat makes people go away from Broadway when they've got plunks enough\r\nto stay there and enjoy themselves.'\r\n\r\n'Do you like Broadway, Peggy?'\r\n\r\n'Do I like Broadway? Does a kid like candy? Why, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'It's all right for the time. It's not my ideal.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, and what particular sort of little old Paradise do _you_\r\nhanker after?'\r\n\r\nHe puffed at his pipe, and looked dreamily at her through the smoke.\r\n\r\n'Way over in England, Peggy, there's a county called Worcestershire.\r\nAnd somewhere near the edge of that there's a grey house with gables,\r\nand there's a lawn and a meadow and a shrubbery, and an orchard and a\r\nrose-garden, and a big cedar on the terrace before you get to the\r\nrose-garden. And if you climb to the top of that cedar, you can see the\r\nriver through the apple trees in the orchard. And in the distance there\r\nare hills. And--'\r\n\r\n'Of all the rube joints!' exclaimed Peggy, in deep disgust. 'Why, a day\r\nof that would be about twenty-three hours and a bit too long for me.\r\nBroadway for mine! Put me where I can touch Forty-Second Street without\r\nover-balancing, and then you can leave me. I never thought you were\r\nsuch a hayseed, George.'\r\n\r\n'Don't worry, Peggy. It'll be a long time, I expect, before I go there.\r\nI've got to make my fortune first.'\r\n\r\n'Getting anywhere near the John D. class yet?'\r\n\r\n'I've still some way to go. But things are moving, I think. Do you\r\nknow, Peggy, you remind me of a little Billiken, sitting on that\r\ntable?'\r\n\r\n'Thank _you_, George. I always knew my mouth was rather wide, but\r\nI did think I had Billiken to the bad. Do you do that sort of Candid\r\nFriend stunt with _her_?' She pointed to the photograph on the\r\nmantelpiece. It was the first time since the night when they had met\r\nthat she had made any allusion to it. By silent agreement the subject\r\nhad been ruled out between them. 'By the way, you never told me her\r\nname.'\r\n\r\n'Halliday,' said Rutherford, shortly.\r\n\r\n'What else?'\r\n\r\n'Alice.'\r\n\r\n'Don't bite at me, George! I'm not hurting you. Tell me about her. I'm\r\ninterested. Does she live in the grey house with the pigs and chickens\r\nand all them roses, and the rest of the rube outfit?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Be chummy, George. What's the matter with you?'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry, Peggy,' he said. 'I'm a fool. It's only that it all seems\r\nso damned hopeless! Here am I, earning about half a dollar a year,\r\nand--Still, it's no use kicking, is it? Besides, I may make a home-run\r\nwith my writing one of these days. That's what I meant when I said you\r\nwere a Billiken, Peggy. Do you know, you've brought me luck. Ever since\r\nI met you, I've been doing twice as well. You're my mascot.'\r\n\r\n'Bully for me! We've all got our uses in the world, haven't we? I\r\nwonder if it would help any if I was to kiss you, George?'\r\n\r\n'Don't you do it. One mustn't work a mascot too hard.'\r\n\r\nShe jumped down, and came across the room to where he sat, looking down\r\nat him with the round, grey eyes that always reminded him of a\r\nkitten's.\r\n\r\n'George!'\r\n\r\n'Yes?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, nothing!'\r\n\r\nShe turned away to the mantelpiece, and stood gazing at the photograph,\r\nher back towards him.\r\n\r\n'George!'\r\n\r\n'Hullo?'\r\n\r\n'Say, what colour eyes has she got?'\r\n\r\n'Grey.'\r\n\r\n'Like mine?'\r\n\r\n'Darker than yours.'\r\n\r\n'Nicer than mine?'\r\n\r\n'Don't you think we might talk about something else?'\r\n\r\nShe swung round, her fists clenched, her face blazing.\r\n\r\n'I hate you!' she cried. 'I do! I wish I'd never seen you! I wish--'\r\n\r\nShe leaned on the mantelpiece, burying her face in her arms, and burst\r\ninto a passion of sobs. Rutherford leaped up, shocked and helpless. He\r\nsprang to her, and placed a hand gently on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Peggy, old girl--'\r\n\r\nShe broke from him.\r\n\r\n'Don't you touch me! Don't you do it! Gee, I wish I'd never seen you!'\r\n\r\nShe ran to the door, darted through, and banged it behind her.\r\n\r\nRutherford remained where he stood, motionless. Then, almost\r\nmechanically, he felt in his pocket for matches, and relit his pipe.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed. Then the door opened slowly. Peggy came in. She\r\nwas pale, and her eyes were red. She smiled--a pathetic little smile.\r\n\r\n'Peggy!'\r\n\r\nHe took a step towards her.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry, George. I feel mean.'\r\n\r\n'Dear old girl, what rot!'\r\n\r\n'I do. You don't know how mean I feel. You've been real nice to me,\r\nGeorge. Thought I'd look in and say I was sorry. Good night, George!'\r\n\r\nOn the following night he waited, but she did not come. The nights went\r\nby, and still she did not come. And one morning, reading his paper, he\r\nsaw that _The Island of Girls_ had gone west to Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThings were not running well for Rutherford. He had had his vacation, a\r\ngolden fortnight of fresh air and sunshine in the Catskills, and was\r\nback in Alcala, trying with poor success, to pick up the threads of his\r\nwork. But though the Indian Summer had begun, and there was energy in\r\nthe air, night after night he sat idle in his room; night after night\r\nwent wearily to bed, oppressed with a dull sense of failure. He could\r\nnot work. He was restless. His thoughts would not concentrate\r\nthemselves. Something was wrong; and he knew what it was, though he\r\nfought against admitting it to himself. It was the absence of Peggy\r\nthat had brought about the change. Not till now had he realized to the\r\nfull how greatly her visits had stimulated him. He had called her\r\nlaughingly his mascot; but the thing was no joke. It was true. Her\r\nabsence was robbing him of the power to write.\r\n\r\nHe was lonely. For the first time since he had come to New York he was\r\nreally lonely. Solitude had not hurt him till now. In his black moments\r\nit had been enough for him to look up at the photograph on the\r\nmantelpiece, and instantly he was alone no longer. But now the\r\nphotograph had lost its magic. It could not hold him. Always his mind\r\nwould wander back to the little, black-haired ghost that sat on the\r\ntable, smiling at him, and questioning him with its grey eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd the days went by, unvarying in their monotony. And always the ghost\r\nsat on the table, smiling at him.\r\n\r\nWith the Fall came the reopening of the theatres. One by one the\r\nelectric signs blazed out along Broadway, spreading the message that\r\nthe dull days were over, and New York was itself again. At the Melody,\r\nwhere ages ago _The Island of Girls_ had run its light-hearted\r\ncourse, a new musical piece was in rehearsal. Alcala was full once\r\nmore. The nightly snatches of conversation outside his door had\r\nrecommenced. He listened for her voice, but he never heard it.\r\n\r\nHe sat up, waiting, into the small hours, but she did not come. Once he\r\nhad been trying to write, and had fallen, as usual, to brooding--there\r\nwas a soft knock at the door. In an instant he had bounded from his\r\nchair, and turned the handle. It was one of the reporters from\r\nupstairs, who had run out of matches. Rutherford gave him a handful.\r\nThe reporter went out, wondering what the man had laughed at.\r\n\r\nThere is balm in Broadway, especially by night. Depression vanishes\r\nbefore the cheerfulness of the great white way when the lights are lit\r\nand the human tide is in full flood. Rutherford had developed of late a\r\nhabit of patrolling the neighbourhood of Forty-Second Street at\r\ntheatre-time. He found it did him good. There is a gaiety, a bonhomie,\r\nin the atmosphere of the New York streets. Rutherford loved to stand on\r\nthe sidewalk and watch the passers-by, weaving stories round them.\r\n\r\nOne night his wanderings had brought him to Herald Square. The theatres\r\nwere just emptying themselves. This was the time he liked best. He drew\r\nto one side to watch, and as he moved he saw Peggy.\r\n\r\nShe was standing at the corner, buttoning a glove. He was by her side\r\nin an instant.\r\n\r\n'Peggy!' he cried.\r\n\r\nShe was looking pale and tired, but the colour came back to her cheeks\r\nas she held out her hand. There was no trace of embarrassment in her\r\nmanner; only a frank pleasure at seeing him again.\r\n\r\n'Where have you been?' he said. 'I couldn't think what had become of\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n'Did you miss me, George?'\r\n\r\n'Miss you? Of course I did. My work's been going all to pieces since\r\nyou went away.'\r\n\r\n'I only came back last night. I'm in the new piece at the Madison. Gee,\r\nI'm tired, George! We've been rehearsing all day.'\r\n\r\nHe took her by the arm.\r\n\r\n'Come along and have some supper. You look worn out. By Jove, Peggy,\r\nit's good seeing you again! Can you walk as far as Rector's, or shall I\r\ncarry you?'\r\n\r\n'Guess I can walk that far. But Rector's? Has your rich uncle died and\r\nleft you a fortune, George?'\r\n\r\n'Don't you worry, Peggy. This is an occasion. I thought I was never\r\ngoing to see you again. I'll buy you the whole hotel, if you like.'\r\n\r\n'Just supper'll do, I guess. You're getting quite the rounder, George.'\r\n\r\n'You bet I am. There are all sorts of sides to my character you've\r\nnever so much as dreamed of.'\r\n\r\nThey seemed to know Peggy at Rector's. Paul, the head waiter, beamed\r\nupon her paternally. One or two men turned and looked after her as she\r\npassed. The waiters smiled slight but friendly smiles. Rutherford,\r\nintent on her, noticed none of these things.\r\n\r\nDespite her protests, he ordered an elaborate and expensive supper. He\r\nwas particular about the wine. The waiter, who had been doubtful about\r\nhim, was won over, and went off to execute the order, reflecting that\r\nit was never safe to judge a man by his clothes, and that Rutherford\r\nwas probably one of these eccentric young millionaires who didn't care\r\nhow they dressed.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Peggy, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Rutherford.\r\n\r\n'You're looking brown, George.'\r\n\r\n'I've been away in the Catskills.'\r\n\r\n'Still as strong on the rube proposition as ever?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. But Broadway has its points, too.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, you're beginning to see that? Gee, I'm glad to be back. I've had\r\nenough of the Wild West. If anybody ever tries to steer you west of\r\nEleventh Avenue, George, don't you go. There's nothing doing. How have\r\nyou been making out at your writing stunt?'\r\n\r\n'Pretty well. But I wanted you. I was lost without my mascot. I've got\r\na story in this month's _Wilson's_. A long story, and paid\r\naccordingly. That's why I'm able to go about giving suppers to great\r\nactresses.'\r\n\r\n'I read it on the train,' said Peggy. 'It's dandy. Do you know what you\r\nought to do, George? You ought to turn it into a play. There's a heap\r\nof money in plays.'\r\n\r\n'I know. But who wants a play by an unknown man?'\r\n\r\n'I know who would want _Willie in the Wilderness_, if you made it\r\ninto a play, and that's Winfield Knight. Ever seen him?'\r\n\r\n'I saw him in _The Outsider_. He's clever.'\r\n\r\n'He's It, if he gets a part to suit him. If he doesn't, he don't amount\r\nto a row of beans. It's just a gamble. This thing he's in now is no\r\ngood. The part doesn't begin to fit him. In a month he'll be squealing\r\nfor another play, so's you can hear him in Connecticut.'\r\n\r\n'He shall not squeal in vain,' said Rutherford. 'If he wants my work,\r\nwho am I that I should stand in the way of his simple pleasures? I'll\r\nstart on the thing tomorrow.'\r\n\r\n'I can help you some too, I guess. I used to know Winfield Knight. I\r\ncan put you wise on lots of things about him that'll help you work up\r\nWillie's character so's it'll fit him like a glove.'\r\n\r\nRutherford raised his glass.\r\n\r\n'Peggy,' he said, 'you're more than a mascot. You ought to be drawing a\r\nbig commission on everything I write. It beats me how any of these\r\nother fellows ever write anything without you there to help them. I\r\nwonder what's the most expensive cigar they keep here? I must have it,\r\nwhatever it is. _Noblesse oblige_. We popular playwrights mustn't\r\nbe seen in public smoking any cheap stuff.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Rutherford's artistic temperament which, when they left the\r\nrestaurant, made him hail a taxi-cab. Taxi-cabs are not for young men\r\ndrawing infinitesimal salaries in banks, even if those salaries are\r\nsupplemented at rare intervals by a short story in a magazine. Peggy\r\nwas for returning to Alcala by car, but Rutherford refused to\r\ncountenance such an anti-climax.\r\n\r\nPeggy nestled into the corner of the cab, with a tired sigh, and there\r\nwas silence as they moved smoothly up Broadway.\r\n\r\nHe peered at her in the dim light. She looked very small and wistful\r\nand fragile. Suddenly an intense desire surged over him to pick her up\r\nand crush her to him. He fought against it. He tried to fix his\r\nthoughts on the girl at home, to tell himself that he was a man of\r\nhonour. His fingers, gripping the edge of the seat, tightened till\r\nevery muscle of his arm was rigid.\r\n\r\nThe cab, crossing a rough piece of road, jolted Peggy from her corner.\r\nHer hand fell on his.\r\n\r\n'Peggy!' he cried, hoarsely.\r\n\r\nHer grey eyes were wet. He could see them glisten. And then his arms\r\nwere round her, and he was covering her upturned face with kisses.\r\n\r\nThe cab drew up at the entrance to Alcala. They alighted in silence,\r\nand without a word made their way through into the hall. From force of\r\nhabit, Rutherford glanced at the letter-rack on the wall at the foot of\r\nthe stairs. There was one letter in his pigeon-hole.\r\n\r\nMechanically he drew it out; and, as his eyes fell on the handwriting,\r\nsomething seemed to snap inside him.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Peggy, standing on the bottom stair, and back again at the\r\nenvelope in his hand. His mood was changing with a violence that left\r\nhim physically weak. He felt dazed, as if he had wakened out of a\r\ntrance.\r\n\r\nWith a strong effort he mastered himself. Peggy had mounted a few\r\nsteps, and was looking back at him over her shoulder. He could read the\r\nmeaning now in the grey eyes.\r\n\r\n'Good night, Peggy,' he said in a low voice. She turned, facing him,\r\nand for a moment neither moved.\r\n\r\n'Good night!' said Rutherford again.\r\n\r\nHer lips parted, as if she were about to speak, but she said nothing.\r\n\r\nThen she turned again, and began to walk slowly upstairs.\r\n\r\nHe stood watching her till she had reached the top of the long flight.\r\nShe did not look back.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nPeggy's nightly visits began afresh after this, and the ghost on the\r\ntable troubled Rutherford no more. His restlessness left him. He began\r\nto write with a new vigour and success. In after years he wrote many\r\nplays, most of them good, clear-cut pieces of work, but none that came\r\nfrom him with the utter absence of labour which made the writing of\r\n_Willie in the Wilderness_ a joy. He wrote easily, without effort.\r\nAnd always Peggy was there, helping, stimulating, encouraging.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when he came in after dinner to settle down to work, he\r\nwould find a piece of paper on his table covered with her schoolgirl\r\nscrawl. It would run somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n'He is proud of his arms. They are skinny, but he thinks them the\r\nlimit. Better put in a shirt-sleeve scene for Willie somewhere.'\r\n\r\n'He thinks he has a beautiful profile. Couldn't you make one of the\r\ngirls say something about Willie having the goods in that line?'\r\n\r\n'He is crazy about golf.'\r\n\r\n'He is proud of his French accent. Couldn't you make Willie speak a\r\nlittle piece in French?'\r\n\r\n'He' being Winfield Knight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so, little by little, the character of Willie grew, till it ceased\r\nto be the Willie of the magazine story, and became Winfield Knight\r\nhimself, with improvements. The task began to fascinate Rutherford. It\r\nwas like planning a pleasant surprise for a child. 'He'll like that,'\r\nhe would say to himself, as he wrote in some speech enabling Willie to\r\ndisplay one of the accomplishments, real or imagined, of the absent\r\nactor. Peggy read it, and approved. It was she who suggested the big\r\nspeech in the second act where Willie described the progress of his\r\nlove affair in terms of the golf-links. From her, too, came information\r\nas to little traits in the man's character which the stranger would not\r\nhave suspected.\r\n\r\nAs the play progressed Rutherford was amazed at the completeness of the\r\ncharacter he had built. It lived. Willie in the magazine story might\r\nhave been anyone. He fitted into the story, but you could not see him.\r\nHe had no real individuality. But Willie in the play! He felt that he\r\nwould recognize him in the street. There was all the difference between\r\nthe two that there is between a nameless figure in some cheap picture\r\nand a portrait by Sargent. There were times when the story of the play\r\nseemed thin to him, and the other characters wooden, but in his\r\nblackest moods he was sure of Willie. All the contradictions in the\r\ncharacter rang true: the humour, the pathos, the surface vanity\r\ncovering a real diffidence, the strength and weakness fighting one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n'You're alive, my son,' said Rutherford, admiringly, as he read the\r\nsheets. 'But you don't belong to me.'\r\n\r\nAt last there came the day when the play was finished, when the last\r\nline was written, and the last possible alteration made; and later, the\r\nday when Rutherford, bearing the brown-paper-covered package under his\r\narm, called at the Players' Club to keep an appointment with Winfield\r\nKnight.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the first Rutherford had a feeling that he had met the man\r\nbefore, that he knew him. As their acquaintance progressed--the actor\r\nwas in an expansive mood, and talked much before coming to business--the\r\nfeeling grew. Then he understood. This was Willie, and no other. The\r\nlikeness was extraordinary. Little turns of thought, little\r\nexpressions--they were all in the play.\r\n\r\nThe actor paused in a description of how he had almost beaten a\r\nchampion at golf, and looked at the parcel.\r\n\r\n'Is that the play?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Rutherford. 'Shall I read it?'\r\n\r\n'Guess I'll just look through it myself. Where's Act I? Here we are!\r\nHave a cigar while you're waiting?'\r\n\r\nRutherford settled himself in his chair, and watched the other's face.\r\nFor the first few pages, which contained some tame dialogue between\r\nminor characters, it was blank.\r\n\r\n'\"Enter Willie,\"' he said. 'Am I Willie?'\r\n\r\n'I hope so,' said Rutherford, with a smile. 'It's the star part.'\r\n\r\n'H'm.'\r\n\r\nHe went on reading. Rutherford watched him with furtive keenness. There\r\nwas a line coming at the bottom of the page which he was then reading\r\nwhich ought to hit him, an epigram on golf, a whimsical thought put\r\nalmost exactly as he had put it himself five minutes back when telling\r\nhis golf story.\r\n\r\nThe shot did not miss fire. The chuckle from the actor and the sigh of\r\nrelief from Rutherford were almost simultaneous. Winfield Knight turned\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n'That's a dandy line about golf,' said he.\r\n\r\nRutherford puffed complacently at his cigar.\r\n\r\n'There's lots more of them in the piece,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Bully for you,' said the actor. And went on reading.\r\n\r\nThree-quarters of an hour passed before he spoke again. Then he looked\r\nup.\r\n\r\n'It's me,' he said; 'it's me all the time. I wish I'd seen this before\r\nI put on the punk I'm doing now. This is me from the drive off the tee.\r\nIt's great! Say, what'll you have?'\r\n\r\nRutherford leaned back in his chair, his mind in a whirl. He had\r\narrived at last. His struggles were over. He would not admit of the\r\npossibility of the play being a failure. He was a made man. He could go\r\nwhere he pleased, and do as he pleased.\r\n\r\nIt gave him something of a shock to find how persistently his thoughts\r\nrefused to remain in England. Try as he might to keep them there, they\r\nkept flitting back to Alcala.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n_Willie in the Wilderness_ was not a failure. It was a triumph.\r\nPrincipally, it is true, a personal triumph for Winfield Knight.\r\nEveryone was agreed that he had never had a part that suited him so\r\nwell. Critics forgave the blunders of the piece for the sake of its\r\nprincipal character. The play was a curiously amateurish thing. It was\r\nonly later that Rutherford learned craft and caution. When he wrote\r\n_Willie_ he was a colt, rambling unchecked through the field of\r\nplay-writing, ignorant of its pitfalls. But, with all its faults,\r\n_Willie in the Wilderness_ was a success. It might, as one critic\r\npointed out, be more of a monologue act for Winfield Knight than a\r\nplay, but that did not affect Rutherford.\r\n\r\nIt was late on the opening night when he returned to Alcala. He had\r\ntried to get away earlier. He wanted to see Peggy. But Winfield Knight,\r\nflushed with success, was in his most expansive mood. He seized upon\r\nRutherford and would not let him go. There was supper, a gay,\r\nuproarious supper, at which everybody seemed to be congratulating\r\neverybody else. Men he had never met before shook him warmly by the\r\nhand. Somebody made a speech, despite the efforts of the rest of the\r\ncompany to prevent him. Rutherford sat there, dazed, out of touch with\r\nthe mood of the party. He wanted Peggy. He was tired of all this\r\nexcitement and noise. He had had enough of it. All he asked was to be\r\nallowed to slip away quietly and go home. He wanted to think, to try\r\nand realize what all this meant to him.\r\n\r\nAt length the party broke up in one last explosion of handshaking and\r\ncongratulations; and, eluding Winfield Knight, who proposed to take him\r\noff to his club, he started to walk up Broadway.\r\n\r\nIt was late when he reached Alcala. There was a light in his room.\r\nPeggy had waited up to hear the news.\r\n\r\nShe jumped off the table as he came in.\r\n\r\n'Well?' she cried.\r\n\r\nRutherford sat down and stretched out his legs.\r\n\r\n'It's a success,' he said. 'A tremendous success!'\r\n\r\nPeggy clapped her hands.\r\n\r\n'Bully for you, George! I knew it would be. Tell me all about it. Was\r\nWinfield good?'\r\n\r\n'He was the whole piece. There was nothing in it but him.' He rose and\r\nplaced his hands on her shoulders. 'Peggy, old girl, I don't know what\r\nto say. You know as well as I do that it's all owing to you that the\r\npiece has been a success. If I hadn't had your help--'\r\n\r\nPeggy laughed.\r\n\r\n'Oh, beat it, George!' she said. 'Don't you come jollying me. I look\r\nlike a high-brow playwright, don't I! No; I'm real glad you've made a\r\nhit, George, but don't start handing out any story about it's not being\r\nyour own. I didn't do a thing.'\r\n\r\n'You did. You did everything.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't. But, say, don't let's start quarrelling. Tell me more about\r\nit. How many calls did you take.'\r\n\r\nHe told her all that had happened. When he had finished, there was a\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n'I guess you'll be quitting soon, George?' said Peggy, at last. 'Now\r\nthat you've made a home-run. You'll be going back to that rube joint,\r\nwith the cows and hens--isn't that it?'\r\n\r\nRutherford did not reply. He was staring thoughtfully at the floor. He\r\ndid not seem to have heard.\r\n\r\n'I guess that girl'll be glad to see you,' she went on. 'Shall you\r\ncable tomorrow, George? And then you'll get married and go and live in\r\nthe rube house, and become a regular hayseed and--' She broke off\r\nsuddenly, with a catch in her voice. 'Gee,' she whispered, halt to\r\nherself, 'I'll be sorry when you go, George.'\r\n\r\nHe sprang up.\r\n\r\n'Peggy!'\r\n\r\nHe seized her by the arm. He heard the quick intake of her breath.\r\n\r\n'Peggy, listen!' He gripped her till she winced with pain. 'I'm not\r\ngoing back. I'm never going back. I'm a cad, I'm a hound! I know I am.\r\nBut I'm not going back. I'm going to stay here with you. I want you,\r\nPeggy. Do you hear? I want you!'\r\n\r\nShe tried to draw herself away, but he held her.\r\n\r\n'I love you, Peggy! Peggy, will you be my wife?'\r\n\r\nThere was utter astonishment in her grey eyes. Her face was very white.\r\n\r\n'Will you, Peggy?'\r\n\r\nHe dropped her arm.\r\n\r\n'Will you, Peggy?'\r\n\r\n'No!' she cried.\r\n\r\nHe drew back.\r\n\r\n'No!' she cried sharply, as if it hurt her to speak. 'I wouldn't play\r\nyou such a mean trick. I'm too fond of you, George. There's never been\r\nanybody just like you. You've been mighty good to me. I've never met a\r\nman who treated me like you. You're the only real white man that's ever\r\nhappened to me, and I guess I'm not going to play you a low-down trick\r\nlike spoiling your life. George, I thought you knew. Honest, I thought\r\nyou knew. How did you think I lived in a swell place like this, if you\r\ndidn't know? How did you suppose everyone knew me at Rector's? How did\r\nyou think I'd managed to find out so much about Winfield Knight? Can't\r\nyou guess?'\r\n\r\nShe drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n'I--'\r\n\r\nHe interrupted her hoarsely.\r\n\r\n'Is there anyone now, Peggy?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she said, 'there is.'\r\n\r\n'You don't love him, Peggy, do you?'\r\n\r\n'Love him?' She laughed bitterly. 'No; I don't love him.'\r\n\r\n'Then come to me, dear,' he said.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head in silence. Rutherford sat down, his chin resting in\r\nhis hands. She came across to him, and smoothed his hair.\r\n\r\n'It wouldn't do, George,' she said. 'Honest, it wouldn't do. Listen.\r\nWhen we first met, I--I rather liked you, George, and I was mad at you\r\nfor being so fond of the other girl and taking no notice of me--not in\r\nthe way I wanted, and I tried--Gee, I feel mean. It was all my fault. I\r\ndidn't think it would matter. There didn't seem no chance then of your\r\nbeing able to go back and have the sort of good time you wanted; and I\r\nthought you'd just stay here and we'd be pals and--but now you can go\r\nback, it's all different. I couldn't keep you. It would be too mean.\r\nYou see, you don't really want to stop. You think you do, but you\r\ndon't!'\r\n\r\n'I love you,' he muttered.\r\n\r\n'You'll forget me. It's all just a Broadway dream, George. Think of it\r\nlike that. Broadway's got you now, but you don't really belong. You're\r\nnot like me. It's not in your blood, so's you can't get it out. It's\r\nthe chickens and roses you want really. Just a Broadway dream. That's\r\nwhat it is. George, when I was a kid, I remember crying and crying for\r\na lump of candy in the window of a store till one of my brothers up and\r\nbought it for me just to stop the racket. Gee! For about a minute I was\r\nthe busiest thing that ever happened, eating away. And then it didn't\r\nseem to interest me no more. Broadway's like that for you, George. You\r\ngo back to the girl and the cows and all of it. It'll hurt some, I\r\nguess, but I reckon you'll be glad you did.'\r\n\r\nShe stooped swiftly, and kissed him on the forehead.\r\n\r\n'I'll miss you, dear,' she said, softly, and was gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRutherford sat on, motionless. Outside, the blackness changed to grey,\r\nand the grey to white. He got up. He felt very stiff and cold.\r\n\r\n'A Broadway dream!' he muttered.\r\n\r\nHe went to the mantelpiece and took up the photograph. He carried it to\r\nthe window where he could see it better.\r\n\r\nA shaft of sunlight pierced the curtains and fell upon it."
