THE COMING OF GOWF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n_The Clicking of Cuthbert_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young man came into the smoking-room of the clubhouse, and flung\r\nhis bag with a clatter on the floor. He sank moodily into an arm-chair\r\nand pressed the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Waiter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\nThe young man pointed at the bag with every evidence of distaste.\r\n\r\n\"You may have these clubs,\" he said. \"Take them away. If you don't want\r\nthem yourself, give them to one of the caddies.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the room the Oldest Member gazed at him with a grave sadness\r\nthrough the smoke of his pipe. His eye was deep and dreamy--the eye of\r\na man who, as the poet says, has seen Golf steadily and seen it whole.\r\n\r\n\"You are giving up golf?\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe was not altogether unprepared for such an attitude on the young\r\nman's part: for from his eyrie on the terrace above the ninth green he\r\nhad observed him start out on the afternoon's round and had seen him\r\nlose a couple of balls in the lake at the second hole after taking\r\nseven strokes at the first.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" cried the young man fiercely. \"For ever, dammit! Footling game!\r\nBlanked infernal fat-headed silly ass of a game! Nothing but a waste of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sage winced.\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that, my boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do say it. What earthly good is golf? Life is stern and life is\r\nearnest. We live in a practical age. All round us we see foreign\r\ncompetition making itself unpleasant. And we spend our time playing\r\ngolf! What do we get out of it? Is golf any _use_? That's what I'm\r\nasking you. Can you name me a single case where devotion to this\r\npestilential pastime has done a man any practical good?\"\r\n\r\nThe Sage smiled gently.\r\n\r\n\"I could name a thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"One will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will select,\" said the Sage, \"from the innumerable memories that\r\nrush to my mind, the story of Cuthbert Banks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never heard of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be of good cheer,\" said the Oldest Member. \"You are going to hear of\r\nhim now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was in the picturesque little settlement of Wood Hills (said the\r\nOldest Member) that the incidents occurred which I am about to relate.\r\nEven if you have never been in Wood Hills, that suburban paradise is\r\nprobably familiar to you by name. Situated at a convenient distance\r\nfrom the city, it combines in a notable manner the advantages of town\r\nlife with the pleasant surroundings and healthful air of the country.\r\nIts inhabitants live in commodious houses, standing in their own\r\ngrounds, and enjoy so many luxuries--such as gravel soil, main\r\ndrainage, electric light, telephone, baths (h. and c.), and company's\r\nown water, that you might be pardoned for imagining life to be so ideal\r\nfor them that no possible improvement could be added to their lot. Mrs.\r\nWilloughby Smethurst was under no such delusion. What Wood Hills needed\r\nto make it perfect, she realized, was Culture. Material comforts are\r\nall very well, but, if the _summum bonum_ is to be achieved, the\r\nSoul also demands a look in, and it was Mrs. Smethurst's unfaltering\r\nresolve that never while she had her strength should the Soul be handed\r\nthe loser's end. It was her intention to make Wood Hills a centre of\r\nall that was most cultivated and refined, and, golly! how she had\r\nsucceeded. Under her presidency the Wood Hills Literary and Debating\r\nSociety had tripled its membership.\r\n\r\nBut there is always a fly in the ointment, a caterpillar in the salad.\r\nThe local golf club, an institution to which Mrs. Smethurst strongly\r\nobjected, had also tripled its membership; and the division of the\r\ncommunity into two rival camps, the Golfers and the Cultured, had\r\nbecome more marked than ever. This division, always acute, had attained\r\nnow to the dimensions of a Schism. The rival sects treated one another\r\nwith a cold hostility.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate episodes came to widen the breach. Mrs. Smethurst's house\r\nadjoined the links, standing to the right of the fourth tee: and, as\r\nthe Literary Society was in the habit of entertaining visiting\r\nlecturers, many a golfer had foozled his drive owing to sudden loud\r\noutbursts of applause coinciding with his down-swing. And not long\r\nbefore this story opens a sliced ball, whizzing in at the open window,\r\nhad come within an ace of incapacitating Raymond Parsloe Devine, the\r\nrising young novelist (who rose at that moment a clear foot and a half)\r\nfrom any further exercise of his art. Two inches, indeed, to the right\r\nand Raymond must inevitably have handed in his dinner-pail.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, a ring at the front-door bell followed almost\r\nimmediately, and the maid ushered in a young man of pleasing appearance\r\nin a sweater and baggy knickerbockers who apologetically but firmly\r\ninsisted on playing his ball where it lay, and, what with the shock of\r\nthe lecturer's narrow escape and the spectacle of the intruder standing\r\non the table and working away with a niblick, the afternoon's session\r\nhad to be classed as a complete frost. Mr. Devine's determination, from\r\nwhich no argument could swerve him, to deliver the rest of his lecture\r\nin the coal-cellar gave the meeting a jolt from which it never\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon this incident, because it was the means of\r\nintroducing Cuthbert Banks to Mrs. Smethurst's niece, Adeline. As\r\nCuthbert, for it was he who had so nearly reduced the muster-roll of\r\nrising novelists by one, hopped down from the table after his stroke,\r\nhe was suddenly aware that a beautiful girl was looking at him\r\nintently. As a matter of fact, everyone in the room was looking at him\r\nintently, none more so than Raymond Parsloe Devine, but none of the\r\nothers were beautiful girls. Long as the members of Wood Hills Literary\r\nSociety were on brain, they were short on looks, and, to Cuthbert's\r\nexcited eye, Adeline Smethurst stood out like a jewel in a pile of\r\ncoke.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen her before, for she had only arrived at her aunt's\r\nhouse on the previous day, but he was perfectly certain that life, even\r\nwhen lived in the midst of gravel soil, main drainage, and company's\r\nown water, was going to be a pretty poor affair if he did not see her\r\nagain. Yes, Cuthbert was in love: and it is interesting to record, as\r\nshowing the effect of the tender emotion on a man's game, that twenty\r\nminutes after he had met Adeline he did the short eleventh in one, and\r\nas near as a toucher got a three on the four-hundred-yard twelfth.\r\n\r\nI will skip lightly over the intermediate stages of Cuthbert's\r\ncourtship and come to the moment when--at the annual ball in aid of the\r\nlocal Cottage Hospital, the only occasion during the year on which the\r\nlion, so to speak, lay down with the lamb, and the Golfers and the\r\nCultured met on terms of easy comradeship, their differences\r\ntemporarily laid aside--he proposed to Adeline and was badly stymied.\r\n\r\nThat fair, soulful girl could not see him with a spy-glass.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Banks,\" she said, \"I will speak frankly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charge right ahead,\" assented Cuthbert.\r\n\r\n\"Deeply sensible as I am of----\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Of the honour and the compliment and all that. But, passing\r\nlightly over all that guff, what seems to be the trouble? I love you to\r\ndistraction----\"\r\n\r\n\"Love is not everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wrong,\" said Cuthbert, earnestly. \"You're right off it.\r\nLove----\" And he was about to dilate on the theme when she interrupted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I am a girl of ambition.\"\r\n\r\n\"And very nice, too,\" said Cuthbert.\r\n\r\n\"I am a girl of ambition,\" repeated Adeline, \"and I realize that the\r\nfulfilment of my ambitions must come through my husband. I am very\r\nordinary myself----\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Cuthbert. \"You ordinary? Why, you are a pearl among\r\nwomen, the queen of your sex. You can't have been looking in a glass\r\nlately. You stand alone. Simply alone. You make the rest look like\r\nbattered repaints.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Adeline, softening a trifle, \"I believe I am fairly\r\ngood-looking----\"\r\n\r\n\"Anybody who was content to call you fairly good-looking would describe\r\nthe Taj Mahal as a pretty nifty tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is not the point. What I mean is, if I marry a nonentity I\r\nshall be a nonentity myself for ever. And I would sooner die than be a\r\nnonentity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, if I follow your reasoning, you think that that lets _me_\r\nout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, really, Mr. Banks, _have_ you done anything, or are you\r\nlikely ever to do anything worth while?\"\r\n\r\nCuthbert hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"It's true,\" he said, \"I didn't finish in the first ten in the Open,\r\nand I was knocked out in the semi-final of the Amateur, but I won the\r\nFrench Open last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"The--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The French Open Championship. Golf, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Golf! You waste all your time playing golf. I admire a man who is more\r\nspiritual, more intellectual.\"\r\n\r\nA pang of jealousy rent Cuthbert's bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Like What's-his-name Devine?\" he said, sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Devine,\" replied Adeline, blushing faintly, \"is going to be a\r\ngreat man. Already he has achieved much. The critics say that he is\r\nmore Russian than any other young English writer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is that good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought the wheeze would be to be more English than any\r\nother young English writer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Who wants an English writer to be English? You've got to be\r\nRussian or Spanish or something to be a real success. The mantle of the\r\ngreat Russians has descended on Mr. Devine.\"\r\n\r\n\"From what I've heard of Russians, I should hate to have that happen to\r\n_me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no danger of that,\" said Adeline scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Well, let me tell you that there is a lot more in me than you\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might easily be so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I'm not spiritual and intellectual,\" said Cuthbert, deeply\r\nmoved. \"Very well. Tomorrow I join the Literary Society.\"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke the words his leg was itching to kick himself for\r\nbeing such a chump, but the sudden expression of pleasure on Adeline's\r\nface soothed him; and he went home that night with the feeling that he\r\nhad taken on something rather attractive. It was only in the cold, grey\r\nlight of the morning that he realized what he had let himself in for.\r\n\r\nI do not know if you have had any experience of suburban literary\r\nsocieties, but the one that flourished under the eye of Mrs. Willoughby\r\nSmethurst at Wood Hills was rather more so than the average. With my\r\nfeeble powers of narrative, I cannot hope to make clear to you all that\r\nCuthbert Banks endured in the next few weeks. And, even if I could, I\r\ndoubt if I should do so. It is all very well to excite pity and terror,\r\nas Aristotle recommends, but there are limits. In the ancient Greek\r\ntragedies it was an ironclad rule that all the real rough stuff should\r\ntake place off-stage, and I shall follow this admirable principle. It\r\nwill suffice if I say merely that J. Cuthbert Banks had a thin time.\r\nAfter attending eleven debates and fourteen lectures on _vers libre_\r\nPoetry, the Seventeenth-Century Essayists, the Neo-Scandinavian\r\nMovement in Portuguese Literature, and other subjects of a similar\r\nnature, he grew so enfeebled that, on the rare occasions when he had\r\ntime for a visit to the links, he had to take a full iron for his mashie\r\nshots.\r\n\r\nIt was not simply the oppressive nature of the debates and lectures\r\nthat sapped his vitality. What really got right in amongst him was the\r\ntorture of seeing Adeline's adoration of Raymond Parsloe Devine. The\r\nman seemed to have made the deepest possible impression upon her\r\nplastic emotions. When he spoke, she leaned forward with parted lips\r\nand looked at him. When he was not speaking--which was seldom--she\r\nleaned back and looked at him. And when he happened to take the next\r\nseat to her, she leaned sideways and looked at him. One glance at Mr.\r\nDevine would have been more than enough for Cuthbert; but Adeline found\r\nhim a spectacle that never palled. She could not have gazed at him with\r\na more rapturous intensity if she had been a small child and he a\r\nsaucer of ice-cream. All this Cuthbert had to witness while still\r\nendeavouring to retain the possession of his faculties sufficiently to\r\nenable him to duck and back away if somebody suddenly asked him what he\r\nthought of the sombre realism of Vladimir Brusiloff. It is little\r\nwonder that he tossed in bed, picking at the coverlet, through\r\nsleepless nights, and had to have all his waistcoats taken in three\r\ninches to keep them from sagging.\r\n\r\nThis Vladimir Brusiloff to whom I have referred was the famous Russian\r\nnovelist, and, owing to the fact of his being in the country on a\r\nlecturing tour at the moment, there had been something of a boom in his\r\nworks. The Wood Hills Literary Society had been studying them for\r\nweeks, and never since his first entrance into intellectual circles had\r\nCuthbert Banks come nearer to throwing in the towel. Vladimir\r\nspecialized in grey studies of hopeless misery, where nothing happened\r\ntill page three hundred and eighty, when the moujik decided to commit\r\nsuicide. It was tough going for a man whose deepest reading hitherto\r\nhad been Vardon on the Push-Shot, and there can be no greater proof of\r\nthe magic of love than the fact that Cuthbert stuck it without a cry.\r\nBut the strain was terrible and I am inclined to think that he must\r\nhave cracked, had it not been for the daily reports in the papers of\r\nthe internecine strife which was proceeding so briskly in Russia.\r\nCuthbert was an optimist at heart, and it seemed to him that, at the\r\nrate at which the inhabitants of that interesting country were\r\nmurdering one another, the supply of Russian novelists must eventually\r\ngive out.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as he tottered down the road for the short walk which was\r\nnow almost the only exercise to which he was equal, Cuthbert met\r\nAdeline. A spasm of anguish flitted through all his nerve-centres as he\r\nsaw that she was accompanied by Raymond Parsloe Devine.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Banks,\" said Adeline.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" said Cuthbert hollowly.\r\n\r\n\"Such good news about Vladimir Brusiloff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" said Cuthbert, with a touch of hope.\r\n\r\n\"Dead? Of course not. Why should he be? No, Aunt Emily met his manager\r\nafter his lecture at Queen's Hall yesterday, and he has promised that\r\nMr. Brusiloff shall come to her next Wednesday reception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ah!\" said Cuthbert, dully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how she managed it. I think she must have told him that\r\nMr. Devine would be there to meet him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you said he was coming,\" argued Cuthbert.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very glad,\" said Raymond Devine, \"of the opportunity of\r\nmeeting Brusiloff.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure,\" said Adeline, \"he will be very glad of the opportunity of\r\nmeeting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" said Mr. Devine. \"Possibly. Competent critics have said\r\nthat my work closely resembles that of the great Russian Masters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your psychology is so deep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\r\nCuthbert in a perfect agony of spirit prepared to withdraw from this\r\nlove-feast. The sun was shining brightly, but the world was black to\r\nhim. Birds sang in the tree-tops, but he did not hear them. He might\r\nhave been a moujik for all the pleasure he found in life.\r\n\r\n\"You will be there, Mr. Banks?\" said Adeline, as he turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right,\" said Cuthbert.\r\n\r\nWhen Cuthbert had entered the drawing-room on the following Wednesday\r\nand had taken his usual place in a distant corner where, while able to\r\nfeast his gaze on Adeline, he had a sporting chance of being overlooked\r\nor mistaken for a piece of furniture, he perceived the great Russian\r\nthinker seated in the midst of a circle of admiring females. Raymond\r\nParsloe Devine had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nHis first glance at the novelist surprised Cuthbert. Doubtless with the\r\nbest motives, Vladimir Brusiloff had permitted his face to become\r\nalmost entirely concealed behind a dense zareba of hair, but his eyes\r\nwere visible through the undergrowth, and it seemed to Cuthbert that\r\nthere was an expression in them not unlike that of a cat in a strange\r\nbackyard surrounded by small boys. The man looked forlorn and hopeless,\r\nand Cuthbert wondered whether he had had bad news from home.\r\n\r\nThis was not the case. The latest news which Vladimir Brusiloff had had\r\nfrom Russia had been particularly cheering. Three of his principal\r\ncreditors had perished in the last massacre of the _bourgeoisie_,\r\nand a man whom he owed for five years for a samovar and a pair of\r\novershoes had fled the country, and had not been heard of since. It was\r\nnot bad news from home that was depressing Vladimir. What was wrong\r\nwith him was the fact that this was the eighty-second suburban literary\r\nreception he had been compelled to attend since he had landed in the\r\ncountry on his lecturing tour, and he was sick to death of it. When his\r\nagent had first suggested the trip, he had signed on the dotted line\r\nwithout an instant's hesitation. Worked out in roubles, the fees\r\noffered had seemed just about right. But now, as he peered through\r\nthe brushwood at the faces round him, and realized that eight out of\r\nten of those present had manuscripts of some sort concealed on their\r\npersons, and were only waiting for an opportunity to whip them out\r\nand start reading, he wished that he had stayed at his quiet home in\r\nNijni-Novgorod, where the worst thing that could happen to a fellow\r\nwas a brace of bombs coming in through the window and mixing\r\nthemselves up with his breakfast egg.\r\n\r\nAt this point in his meditations he was aware that his hostess was\r\nlooming up before him with a pale young man in horn-rimmed spectacles\r\nat her side. There was in Mrs. Smethurst's demeanour something of the\r\nunction of the master-of-ceremonies at the big fight who introduces the\r\nearnest gentleman who wishes to challenge the winner.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Brusiloff,\" said Mrs. Smethurst, \"I do so want you to meet Mr.\r\nRaymond Parsloe Devine, whose work I expect you know. He is one of our\r\nyounger novelists.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinguished visitor peered in a wary and defensive manner through\r\nthe shrubbery, but did not speak. Inwardly he was thinking how exactly\r\nlike Mr. Devine was to the eighty-one other younger novelists to whom\r\nhe had been introduced at various hamlets throughout the country.\r\nRaymond Parsloe Devine bowed courteously, while Cuthbert, wedged into\r\nhis corner, glowered at him.\r\n\r\n\"The critics,\" said Mr. Devine, \"have been kind enough to say that my\r\npoor efforts contain a good deal of the Russian spirit. I owe much to\r\nthe great Russians. I have been greatly influenced by Sovietski.\"\r\n\r\nDown in the forest something stirred. It was Vladimir Brusiloff's mouth\r\nopening, as he prepared to speak. He was not a man who prattled\r\nreadily, especially in a foreign tongue. He gave the impression that\r\neach word was excavated from his interior by some up-to-date process of\r\nmining. He glared bleakly at Mr. Devine, and allowed three words to\r\ndrop out of him.\r\n\r\n\"Sovietski no good!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, set the machinery working again, and delivered\r\nfive more at the pithead.\r\n\r\n\"I spit me of Sovietski!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a painful sensation. The lot of a popular idol is in many\r\nways an enviable one, but it has the drawback of uncertainty. Here\r\ntoday and gone tomorrow. Until this moment Raymond Parsloe Devine's\r\nstock had stood at something considerably over par in Wood Hills\r\nintellectual circles, but now there was a rapid slump. Hitherto he had\r\nbeen greatly admired for being influenced by Sovietski, but it appeared\r\nnow that this was not a good thing to be. It was evidently a rotten\r\nthing to be. The law could not touch you for being influenced by\r\nSovietski, but there is an ethical as well as a legal code, and this it\r\nwas obvious that Raymond Parsloe Devine had transgressed. Women drew\r\naway from him slightly, holding their skirts. Men looked at him\r\ncensoriously. Adeline Smethurst started violently, and dropped a\r\ntea-cup. And Cuthbert Banks, doing his popular imitation of a sardine\r\nin his corner, felt for the first time that life held something of\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nRaymond Parsloe Devine was plainly shaken, but he made an adroit\r\nattempt to recover his lost prestige.\r\n\r\n\"When I say I have been influenced by Sovietski, I mean, of course,\r\nthat I was once under his spell. A young writer commits many follies. I\r\nhave long since passed through that phase. The false glamour of\r\nSovietski has ceased to dazzle me. I now belong whole-heartedly to the\r\nschool of Nastikoff.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a reaction. People nodded at one another sympathetically.\r\nAfter all, we cannot expect old heads on young shoulders, and a lapse\r\nat the outset of one's career should not be held against one who has\r\neventually seen the light.\r\n\r\n\"Nastikoff no good,\" said Vladimir Brusiloff, coldly. He paused,\r\nlistening to the machinery.\r\n\r\n\"Nastikoff worse than Sovietski.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused again.\r\n\r\n\"I spit me of Nastikoff!\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis time there was no doubt about it. The bottom had dropped out of\r\nthe market, and Raymond Parsloe Devine Preferred were down in the\r\ncellar with no takers. It was clear to the entire assembled company\r\nthat they had been all wrong about Raymond Parsloe Devine. They had\r\nallowed him to play on their innocence and sell them a pup. They had\r\ntaken him at his own valuation, and had been cheated into admiring him\r\nas a man who amounted to something, and all the while he had belonged\r\nto the school of Nastikoff. You never can tell. Mrs. Smethurst's guests\r\nwere well-bred, and there was consequently no violent demonstration,\r\nbut you could see by their faces what they felt. Those nearest Raymond\r\nParsloe jostled to get further away. Mrs. Smethurst eyed him stonily\r\nthrough a raised lorgnette. One or two low hisses were heard, and over\r\nat the other end of the room somebody opened the window in a marked\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nRaymond Parsloe Devine hesitated for a moment, then, realizing his\r\nsituation, turned and slunk to the door. There was an audible sigh of\r\nrelief as it closed behind him.\r\n\r\nVladimir Brusiloff proceeded to sum up.\r\n\r\n\"No novelists any good except me. Sovietski--yah! Nastikoff--bah! I spit\r\nme of zem all. No novelists anywhere any good except me. P. G.\r\nWodehouse and Tolstoi not bad. Not good, but not bad. No novelists any\r\ngood except me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, having uttered this dictum, he removed a slab of cake from a\r\nnear-by plate, steered it through the jungle, and began to champ.\r\n\r\nIt is too much to say that there was a dead silence. There could never\r\nbe that in any room in which Vladimir Brusiloff was eating cake. But\r\ncertainly what you might call the general chit-chat was pretty well\r\ndown and out. Nobody liked to be the first to speak. The members of the\r\nWood Hills Literary Society looked at one another timidly. Cuthbert,\r\nfor his part, gazed at Adeline; and Adeline gazed into space. It was\r\nplain that the girl was deeply stirred. Her eyes were opened wide, a\r\nfaint flush crimsoned her cheeks, and her breath was coming quickly.\r\n\r\nAdeline's mind was in a whirl. She felt as if she had been walking\r\ngaily along a pleasant path and had stopped suddenly on the very brink\r\nof a precipice. It would be idle to deny that Raymond Parsloe Devine\r\nhad attracted her extraordinarily. She had taken him at his own\r\nvaluation as an extremely hot potato, and her hero-worship had\r\ngradually been turning into love. And now her hero had been shown to\r\nhave feet of clay. It was hard, I consider, on Raymond Parsloe Devine,\r\nbut that is how it goes in this world. You get a following as a\r\ncelebrity, and then you run up against another bigger celebrity and\r\nyour admirers desert you. One could moralize on this at considerable\r\nlength, but better not, perhaps. Enough to say that the glamour of\r\nRaymond Devine ceased abruptly in that moment for Adeline, and her most\r\ncoherent thought at this juncture was the resolve, as soon as she got\r\nup to her room, to burn the three signed photographs he had sent her\r\nand to give the autographed presentation set of his books to the\r\ngrocer's boy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Smethurst, meanwhile, having rallied somewhat, was endeavouring to\r\nset the feast of reason and flow of soul going again.\r\n\r\n\"And how do you like England, Mr. Brusiloff?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe celebrity paused in the act of lowering another segment of cake.\r\n\r\n\"Dam good,\" he replied, cordially.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you have travelled all over the country by this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said it,\" agreed the Thinker.\r\n\r\n\"Have you met many of our great public men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yais--Yais--Quite a few of the nibs--Lloyid Gorge, I meet him. But----\"\r\nBeneath the matting a discontented expression came into his face, and\r\nhis voice took on a peevish note. \"But I not meet your real great\r\nmen--your Arbmishel, your Arreevadon--I not meet them. That's what\r\ngives me the pipovitch. Have _you_ ever met Arbmishel and\r\nArreevadon?\"\r\n\r\nA strained, anguished look came into Mrs. Smethurst's face and was\r\nreflected in the faces of the other members of the circle. The eminent\r\nRussian had sprung two entirely new ones on them, and they felt that\r\ntheir ignorance was about to be exposed. What would Vladimir Brusiloff\r\nthink of the Wood Hills Literary Society? The reputation of the Wood\r\nHills Literary Society was at stake, trembling in the balance, and\r\ncoming up for the third time. In dumb agony Mrs. Smethurst rolled her\r\neyes about the room searching for someone capable of coming to the\r\nrescue. She drew blank.\r\n\r\nAnd then, from a distant corner, there sounded a deprecating, cough,\r\nand those nearest Cuthbert Banks saw that he had stopped twisting his\r\nright foot round his left ankle and his left foot round his right ankle\r\nand was sitting up with a light of almost human intelligence in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Er----\" said Cuthbert, blushing as every eye in the room seemed to fix\r\nitself on him, \"I think he means Abe Mitchell and Harry Vardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abe Mitchell and Harry Vardon?\" repeated Mrs. Smethurst, blankly. \"I\r\nnever heard of----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yais! Yais! Most! Very!\" shouted Vladimir Brusiloff, enthusiastically.\r\n\"Arbmishel and Arreevadon. You know them, yes, what, no, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've played with Abe Mitchell often, and I was partnered with Harry\r\nVardon in last year's Open.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Russian uttered a cry that shook the chandelier.\r\n\r\n\"You play in ze Open? Why,\" he demanded reproachfully of Mrs.\r\nSmethurst, \"was I not been introducted to this young man who play in\r\nopens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, really,\" faltered Mrs. Smethurst. \"Well, the fact is, Mr.\r\nBrusiloff----\"\r\n\r\nShe broke off. She was unequal to the task of explaining, without\r\nhurting anyone's feelings, that she had always regarded Cuthbert as a\r\npiece of cheese and a blot on the landscape.\r\n\r\n\"Introduct me!\" thundered the Celebrity.\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly, certainly, of course. This is Mr.----.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked appealingly at Cuthbert.\r\n\r\n\"Banks,\" prompted Cuthbert.\r\n\r\n\"Banks!\" cried Vladimir Brusiloff. \"Not Cootaboot Banks?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Is_ your name Cootaboot?\" asked Mrs. Smethurst, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's Cuthbert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yais! Yais! Cootaboot!\" There was a rush and swirl, as the\r\neffervescent Muscovite burst his way through the throng and rushed to\r\nwhere Cuthbert sat. He stood for a moment eyeing him excitedly, then,\r\nstooping swiftly, kissed him on both cheeks before Cuthbert could get\r\nhis guard up. \"My dear young man, I saw you win ze French Open. Great!\r\nGreat! Grand! Superb! Hot stuff, and you can say I said so! Will you\r\npermit one who is but eighteen at Nijni-Novgorod to salute you once\r\nmore?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he kissed Cuthbert again. Then, brushing aside one or two\r\nintellectuals who were in the way, he dragged up a chair and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"You are a great man!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Cuthbert modestly.\r\n\r\n\"Yais! Great. Most! Very! The way you lay your approach-putts dead from\r\nanywhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brusiloff drew his chair closer.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you one vairy funny story about putting. It was one day I\r\nplay at Nijni-Novgorod with the pro. against Lenin and Trotsky, and\r\nTrotsky had a two-inch putt for the hole. But, just as he addresses the\r\nball, someone in the crowd he tries to assassinate Lenin with a\r\nrewolwer--you know that is our great national sport, trying to\r\nassassinate Lenin with rewolwers--and the bang puts Trotsky off his\r\nstroke and he goes five yards past the hole, and then Lenin, who is\r\nrather shaken, you understand, he misses again himself, and we win the\r\nhole and match and I clean up three hundred and ninety-six thousand\r\nroubles, or fifteen shillings in your money. Some gameovitch! And now\r\nlet me tell you one other vairy funny story----\"\r\n\r\nDesultory conversation had begun in murmurs over the rest of the room,\r\nas the Wood Hills intellectuals politely endeavoured to conceal the\r\nfact that they realized that they were about as much out of it at this\r\nre-union of twin souls as cats at a dog-show. From time to time they\r\nstarted as Vladimir Brusiloff's laugh boomed out. Perhaps it was a\r\nconsolation to them to know that he was enjoying himself.\r\n\r\nAs for Adeline, how shall I describe her emotions? She was stunned.\r\nBefore her very eyes the stone which the builders had rejected had\r\nbecome the main thing, the hundred-to-one shot had walked away with the\r\nrace. A rush of tender admiration for Cuthbert Banks flooded her heart.\r\nShe saw that she had been all wrong. Cuthbert, whom she had always\r\ntreated with a patronizing superiority, was really a man to be looked\r\nup to and worshipped. A deep, dreamy sigh shook Adeline's fragile form.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Vladimir and Cuthbert Banks rose.\r\n\r\n\"Goot-a-bye, Mrs. Smet-thirst,\" said the Celebrity. \"Zank you for a\r\nmost charming visit. My friend Cootaboot and me we go now to shoot a\r\nfew holes. You will lend me clobs, friend Cootaboot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"The niblicksky is what I use most. Goot-a-bye, Mrs. Smet-thirst.\"\r\n\r\nThey were moving to the door, when Cuthbert felt a light touch on his\r\narm. Adeline was looking up at him tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"May I come, too, and walk round with you?\"\r\n\r\nCuthbert's bosom heaved.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said, with a tremor in his voice, \"that you would walk round\r\nwith me for life!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes met his.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" she whispered, softly, \"it could be arranged.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" (concluded the Oldest Member), \"you see that golf can be of\r\nthe greatest practical assistance to a man in Life's struggle. Raymond\r\nParsloe Devine, who was no player, had to move out of the neighbourhood\r\nimmediately, and is now, I believe, writing scenarios out in California\r\nfor the Flicker Film Company. Adeline is married to Cuthbert, and it\r\nwas only his earnest pleading which prevented her from having their\r\neldest son christened Abe Mitchell Ribbed-Faced Mashie Banks, for she\r\nis now as keen a devotee of the great game as her husband. Those who\r\nknow them say that theirs is a union so devoted, so----\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sage broke off abruptly, for the young man had rushed to the door\r\nand out into the passage. Through the open door he could hear him\r\ncrying passionately to the waiter to bring back his clubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n_A Woman is only a Woman_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a fine day in the spring, summer, or early autumn, there are few\r\nspots more delightful than the terrace in front of our Golf Club. It is\r\na vantage-point peculiarly fitted to the man of philosophic mind: for\r\nfrom it may be seen that varied, never-ending pageant, which men call\r\nGolf, in a number of its aspects. To your right, on the first tee,\r\nstand the cheery optimists who are about to make their opening drive,\r\nhappily conscious that even a topped shot will trickle a measurable\r\ndistance down the steep hill. Away in the valley, directly in front of\r\nyou, is the lake hole, where these same optimists will be converted to\r\npessimism by the wet splash of a new ball. At your side is the ninth\r\ngreen, with its sinuous undulations which have so often wrecked the\r\nreturning traveller in sight of home. And at various points within your\r\nline of vision are the third tee, the sixth tee, and the sinister\r\nbunkers about the eighth green--none of them lacking in food for the\r\nreflective mind.\r\n\r\nIt is on this terrace that the Oldest Member sits, watching the younger\r\ngeneration knocking at the divot. His gaze wanders from Jimmy\r\nFothergill's two-hundred-and-twenty-yard drive down the hill to the\r\nsilver drops that flash up in the sun, as young Freddie Woosley's\r\nmashie-shot drops weakly into the waters of the lake. Returning, it\r\nrests upon Peter Willard, large and tall, and James Todd, small and\r\nslender, as they struggle up the fair-way of the ninth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLove (says the Oldest Member) is an emotion which your true golfer\r\nshould always treat with suspicion. Do not misunderstand me. I am not\r\nsaying that love is a bad thing, only that it is an unknown quantity. I\r\nhave known cases where marriage improved a man's game, and other cases\r\nwhere it seemed to put him right off his stroke. There seems to be no\r\nfixed rule. But what I do say is that a golfer should be cautious. He\r\nshould not be led away by the first pretty face. I will tell you a\r\nstory that illustrates the point. It is the story of those two men who\r\nhave just got on to the ninth green--Peter Willard and James Todd.\r\n\r\nThere is about great friendships between man and man (said the Oldest\r\nMember) a certain inevitability that can only be compared with the\r\nage-old association of ham and eggs. No one can say when it was that\r\nthese two wholesome and palatable food-stuffs first came together, nor\r\nwhat was the mutual magnetism that brought their deathless partnership\r\nabout. One simply feels that it is one of the things that must be so.\r\nSimilarly with men. Who can trace to its first beginnings the love of\r\nDamon for Pythias, of David for Jonathan, of Swan for Edgar? Who can\r\nexplain what it was about Crosse that first attracted Blackwell? We\r\nsimply say, \"These men are friends,\" and leave it at that.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Peter Willard and James Todd, one may hazard the guess\r\nthat the first link in the chain that bound them together was the fact\r\nthat they took up golf within a few days of each other, and contrived,\r\nas time went on, to develop such equal form at the game that the most\r\nexpert critics are still baffled in their efforts to decide which is\r\nthe worse player. I have heard the point argued a hundred times without\r\nany conclusion being reached. Supporters of Peter claim that his\r\ndriving off the tee entitles him to an unchallenged pre-eminence among\r\nthe world's most hopeless foozlers--only to be discomfited later when\r\nthe advocates of James show, by means of diagrams, that no one has ever\r\nsurpassed their man in absolute incompetence with the spoon. It is one\r\nof those problems where debate is futile.\r\n\r\nFew things draw two men together more surely than a mutual inability to\r\nmaster golf, coupled with an intense and ever-increasing love for the\r\ngame. At the end of the first few months, when a series of costly\r\nexperiments had convinced both Peter and James that there was not a\r\ntottering grey-beard nor a toddling infant in the neighbourhood whose\r\ndownfall they could encompass, the two became inseparable. It was\r\npleasanter, they found, to play together, and go neck and neck round\r\nthe eighteen holes, than to take on some lissome youngster who could\r\nspatter them all over the course with one old ball and a cut-down cleek\r\nstolen from his father; or some spavined elder who not only rubbed it\r\ninto them, but was apt, between strokes, to bore them with personal\r\nreminiscences of the Crimean War. So they began to play together early\r\nand late. In the small hours before breakfast, long ere the first faint\r\npiping of the waking caddie made itself heard from the caddie-shed,\r\nthey were half-way through their opening round. And at close of day,\r\nwhen bats wheeled against the steely sky and the \"pro's\" had stolen\r\nhome to rest, you might see them in the deepening dusk, going through\r\nthe concluding exercises of their final spasm. After dark, they visited\r\neach other's houses and read golf books.\r\n\r\nIf you have gathered from what I have said that Peter Willard and James\r\nTodd were fond of golf, I am satisfied. That is the impression I\r\nintended to convey. They were real golfers, for real golf is a thing of\r\nthe spirit, not of mere mechanical excellence of stroke.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that they devoted too much of their\r\ntime and their thoughts to golf--assuming, indeed, that such a thing is\r\npossible. Each was connected with a business in the metropolis; and\r\noften, before he left for the links, Peter would go to the trouble and\r\nexpense of ringing up the office to say he would not be coming in that\r\nday; while I myself have heard James--and this not once, but\r\nfrequently--say, while lunching in the club-house, that he had half a\r\nmind to get Gracechurch Street on the 'phone and ask how things were\r\ngoing. They were, in fact, the type of men of whom England is\r\nproudest--the back-bone of a great country, toilers in the mart,\r\nuntired businessmen, keen red-blooded men of affairs. If they played a\r\nlittle golf besides, who shall blame them?\r\n\r\nSo they went on, day by day, happy and contented. And then the Woman\r\ncame into their lives, like the Serpent in the Links of Eden, and\r\nperhaps for the first time they realized that they were not one\r\nentity--not one single, indivisible Something that made for topped\r\ndrives and short putts--but two individuals, in whose breasts Nature\r\nhad implanted other desires than the simple ambition some day to do the\r\ndog-leg hole on the second nine in under double figures. My friends\r\ntell me that, when I am relating a story, my language is inclined at\r\ntimes a little to obscure my meaning; but, if you understand from what\r\nI have been saying that James Todd and Peter Willard both fell in love\r\nwith the same woman--all right, let us carry on. That is precisely what\r\nI was driving at.\r\n\r\nI have not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with Grace\r\nForrester. I have seen her in the distance, watering the flowers in her\r\ngarden, and on these occasions her stance struck me as graceful. And\r\nonce, at a picnic, I observed her killing wasps with a teaspoon, and\r\nwas impressed by the freedom of the wrist-action of her back-swing.\r\nBeyond this, I can say little. But she must have been attractive, for\r\nthere can be no doubt of the earnestness with which both Peter and\r\nJames fell in love with her. I doubt if either slept a wink the night\r\nof the dance at which it was their privilege first to meet her.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, happening to encounter Peter in the bunker near the\r\neleventh green, James said:\r\n\r\n\"That was a nice girl, that Miss What's-her-name.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Peter, pausing for a moment from his trench-digging, replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then James, with a pang, knew that he had a rival, for he had not\r\nmentioned Miss Forrester's name, and yet Peter had divined that it was\r\nto her that he had referred.\r\n\r\nLove is a fever which, so to speak, drives off without wasting time on\r\nthe address. On the very next morning after the conversation which I\r\nhave related, James Todd rang Peter Willard up on the 'phone and\r\ncancelled their golf engagements for the day, on the plea of a sprained\r\nwrist. Peter, acknowledging the cancellation, stated that he himself\r\nhad been on the point of ringing James up to say that he would be\r\nunable to play owing to a slight headache. They met at tea-time at Miss\r\nForrester's house. James asked how Peter's headache was, and Peter said\r\nit was a little better. Peter inquired after James's sprained wrist,\r\nand was told it seemed on the mend. Miss Forrester dispensed tea and\r\nconversation to both impartially.\r\n\r\nThey walked home together. After an awkward silence of twenty minutes,\r\nJames said:\r\n\r\n\"There is something about the atmosphere--the aura, shall I say?--that\r\nemanates from a good woman that makes a man feel that life has a new, a\r\ndifferent meaning.\"\r\n\r\nPeter replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached James's door, James said:\r\n\r\n\"I won't ask you in tonight, old man. You want to go home and rest and\r\ncure that headache.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Peter.\r\n\r\nThere was another silence. Peter was thinking that, only a couple of\r\ndays before, James had told him that he had a copy of Sandy MacBean's\r\n\"How to Become a Scratch Man Your First Season by Studying Photographs\"\r\ncoming by parcel-post from town, and they had arranged to read it aloud\r\ntogether. By now, thought Peter, it must be lying on his friend's\r\ntable. The thought saddened him. And James, guessing what was in\r\nPeter's mind, was saddened too. But he did not waver. He was in no mood\r\nto read MacBean's masterpiece that night. In the twenty minutes of\r\nsilence after leaving Miss Forrester he had realized that \"Grace\"\r\nrhymes with \"face\", and he wanted to sit alone in his study and write\r\npoetry. The two men parted with a distant nod. I beg your pardon? Yes,\r\nyou are right. Two distant nods. It was always a failing of mine to\r\ncount the score erroneously.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to weary you by a minute recital of the happenings\r\nof each day that went by. On the surface, the lives of these two men\r\nseemed unchanged. They still played golf together, and during the round\r\nachieved towards each other a manner that, superficially, retained all\r\nits ancient cheeriness and affection. If--I should say--when, James\r\ntopped his drive, Peter never failed to say \"Hard luck!\" And when--or,\r\nrather, if Peter managed not to top his, James invariably said \"Great!\"\r\nBut things were not the same, and they knew it.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, as it sometimes will on these occasions, for Fate is a\r\ndramatist who gets his best effects with a small cast, that Peter\r\nWillard and James Todd were the only visible aspirants for the hand of\r\nMiss Forrester. Right at the beginning young Freddie Woosley had seemed\r\nattracted by the girl, and had called once or twice with flowers and\r\nchocolates, but Freddie's affections never centred themselves on one\r\nobject for more than a few days, and he had dropped out after the first\r\nweek. From that time on it became clear to all of us that, if Grace\r\nForrester intended to marry anyone in the place, it would be either\r\nJames or Peter; and a good deal of interest was taken in the matter by\r\nthe local sportsmen. So little was known of the form of the two men,\r\nneither having figured as principal in a love-affair before, that even\r\nmoney was the best you could get, and the market was sluggish. I think\r\nmy own flutter of twelve golf-balls, taken up by Percival Brown, was\r\nthe most substantial of any of the wagers. I selected James as the\r\nwinner. Why, I can hardly say, unless that he had an aunt who\r\ncontributed occasional stories to the \"Woman's Sphere\". These things\r\nsometimes weigh with a girl. On the other hand, George Lucas, who had\r\nhalf-a-dozen of ginger-ale on Peter, based his calculations on the fact\r\nthat James wore knickerbockers on the links, and that no girl could\r\npossibly love a man with calves like that. In short, you see, we really\r\nhad nothing to go on.\r\n\r\nNor had James and Peter. The girl seemed to like them both equally.\r\nThey never saw her except in each other's company. And it was not until\r\none day when Grace Forrester was knitting a sweater that there seemed a\r\nchance of getting a clue to her hidden feelings.\r\n\r\nWhen the news began to spread through the place that Grace was knitting\r\nthis sweater there was a big sensation. The thing seemed to us\r\npractically to amount to a declaration.\r\n\r\nThat was the view that James Todd and Peter Willard took of it, and\r\nthey used to call on Grace, watch her knitting, and come away with\r\ntheir heads full of complicated calculations. The whole thing hung on\r\none point--to wit, what size the sweater was going to be. If it was\r\nlarge, then it must be for Peter; if small, then James was the lucky\r\nman. Neither dared to make open inquiries, but it began to seem almost\r\nimpossible to find out the truth without them. No masculine eye can\r\nreckon up purls and plains and estimate the size of chest which the\r\ngarment is destined to cover. Moreover, with amateur knitters there\r\nmust always be allowed a margin for involuntary error. There were many\r\ncases during the war where our girls sent sweaters to their sweethearts\r\nwhich would have induced strangulation in their young brothers. The\r\namateur sweater of those days was, in fact, practically tantamount to\r\nGerman propaganda.\r\n\r\nPeter and James were accordingly baffled. One evening the sweater would\r\nlook small, and James would come away jubilant; the next it would have\r\nswollen over a vast area, and Peter would walk home singing. The\r\nsuspense of the two men can readily be imagined. On the one hand, they\r\nwanted to know their fate; on the other, they fully realized that\r\nwhoever the sweater was for would have to wear it. And, as it was a\r\nvivid pink and would probably not fit by a mile, their hearts quailed\r\nat the prospect.\r\n\r\nIn all affairs of human tension there must come a breaking point. It\r\ncame one night as the two men were walking home.\r\n\r\n\"Peter,\" said James, stopping in mid-stride. He mopped his forehead.\r\nHis manner had been feverish all the evening.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Peter.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand this any longer. I haven't had a good night's rest for\r\nweeks. We must find out definitely which of us is to have that\r\nsweater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go back and ask her,\" said Peter.\r\n\r\nSo they turned back and rang the bell and went into the house and\r\npresented themselves before Miss Forrester.\r\n\r\n\"Lovely evening,\" said James, to break the ice.\r\n\r\n\"Superb,\" said Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Delightful,\" said Miss Forrester, looking a little surprised at\r\nfinding the troupe playing a return date without having booked it in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n\"To settle a bet,\" said James, \"will you please tell us who--I should\r\nsay, whom--you are knitting that sweater for?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not a sweater,\" replied Miss Forrester, with a womanly candour\r\nthat well became her. \"It is a sock. And it is for my cousin Juliet's\r\nyoungest son, Willie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" said Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" said Grace Forrester.\r\n\r\nIt was during the long hours of the night, when ideas so often come to\r\nwakeful men, that James was struck by an admirable solution of his and\r\nPeter's difficulty. It seemed to him that, were one or the other to\r\nleave Woodhaven, the survivor would find himself in a position to\r\nconduct his wooing as wooing should be conducted. Hitherto, as I have\r\nindicated, neither had allowed the other to be more than a few minutes\r\nalone with the girl. They watched each other like hawks. When James\r\ncalled, Peter called. When Peter dropped in, James invariably popped\r\nround. The thing had resolved itself into a stalemate.\r\n\r\nThe idea which now came to James was that he and Peter should settle\r\ntheir rivalry by an eighteen-hole match on the links. He thought very\r\nhighly of the idea before he finally went to sleep, and in the morning\r\nthe scheme looked just as good to him as it had done overnight.\r\n\r\nJames was breakfasting next morning, preparatory to going round to\r\ndisclose his plan to Peter, when Peter walked in, looking happier than\r\nhe had done for days.\r\n\r\n\"'Morning,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"'Morning,\" said Peter.\r\n\r\nPeter sat down and toyed absently with a slice of bacon.\r\n\r\n\"I've got an idea,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"One isn't many,\" said James, bringing his knife down with a jerk-shot\r\non a fried egg. \"What is your idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got it last night as I was lying awake. It struck me that, if either\r\nof us was to clear out of this place, the other would have a fair\r\nchance. You know what I mean--with Her. At present we've got each other\r\nstymied. Now, how would it be,\" said Peter, abstractedly spreading\r\nmarmalade on his bacon, \"if we were to play an eighteen-hole match, the\r\nloser to leg out of the neighbourhood and stay away long enough to give\r\nthe winner the chance to find out exactly how things stood?\"\r\n\r\nJames started so violently that he struck himself in the left eye with\r\nhis fork.\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly the idea I got last night, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's a go?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the only thing to do.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. Both men were thinking. Remember, they\r\nwere friends. For years they had shared each other's sorrows, joys, and\r\ngolf-balls, and sliced into the same bunkers.\r\n\r\nPresently Peter said:\r\n\r\n\"I shall miss you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, miss me?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you're gone. Woodhaven won't seem the same place. But of course\r\nyou'll soon be able to come back. I sha'n't waste any time proposing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me your address,\" said James, \"and I'll send you a wire when you\r\ncan return. You won't be offended if I don't ask you to be best man at\r\nthe wedding? In the circumstances it might be painful to you.\"\r\n\r\nPeter sighed dreamily.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have the sitting-room done in blue. Her eyes are blue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" said James, \"there will always be a knife and fork for you\r\nat our little nest. Grace is not the woman to want me to drop my\r\nbachelor friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Touching this match,\" said Peter. \"Strict Royal and Ancient rules, of\r\ncourse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to say--no offence, old man--but no grounding niblicks in\r\nbunkers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. And, without hinting at anything personal, the ball shall\r\nbe considered holed-out only when it is in the hole, not when it stops\r\non the edge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly. And--you know I don't want to hurt your feelings--missing\r\nthe ball counts as a stroke, not as a practice-swing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. And--you'll forgive me if I mention it--a player whose ball\r\nhas fallen in the rough, may not pull up all the bushes within a radius\r\nof three feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact, strict rules.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strict rules.\"\r\n\r\nThey shook hands without more words. And presently Peter walked out,\r\nand James, with a guilty look over his shoulder, took down Sandy\r\nMacBean's great work from the bookshelf and began to study the\r\nphotograph of the short approach-shot showing Mr. MacBean swinging from\r\nPoint A, through dotted line B-C, to Point D, his head the while\r\nremaining rigid at the spot marked with a cross. He felt a little\r\nguiltily that he had stolen a march on his friend, and that the contest\r\nwas as good as over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot recall a lovelier summer day than that on which the great\r\nTodd-Willard eighteen-hole match took place. It had rained during the\r\nnight, and now the sun shone down from a clear blue sky on to turf that\r\nglistened more greenly than the young grass of early spring.\r\nButterflies flitted to and fro; birds sang merrily. In short, all\r\nNature smiled. And it is to be doubted if Nature ever had a better\r\nexcuse for smiling--or even laughing outright; for matches like that\r\nbetween James Todd and Peter Willard do not occur every day.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that love had keyed them up, or whether hours of study\r\nof Braid's \"Advanced Golf\" and the Badminton Book had produced a\r\nbelated effect, I cannot say; but both started off quite reasonably\r\nwell. Our first hole, as you can see, is a bogey four, and James was\r\ndead on the pin in seven, leaving Peter, who had twice hit the United\r\nKingdom with his mashie in mistake for the ball, a difficult putt for\r\nthe half. Only one thing could happen when you left Peter a difficult\r\nputt; and James advanced to the lake hole one up, Peter, as he\r\nfollowed, trying to console himself with the thought that many of the\r\nbest golfers prefer to lose the first hole and save themselves for a\r\nstrong finish.\r\n\r\nPeter and James had played over the lake hole so often that they had\r\nbecome accustomed to it, and had grown into the habit of sinking a ball\r\nor two as a preliminary formality with much the same stoicism displayed\r\nby those kings in ancient and superstitious times who used to fling\r\njewellery into the sea to propitiate it before they took a voyage. But\r\ntoday, by one of those miracles without which golf would not be golf,\r\neach of them got over with his first shot--and not only over, but dead\r\non the pin. Our \"pro.\" himself could not have done better.\r\n\r\nI think it was at this point that the two men began to go to pieces.\r\nThey were in an excited frame of mind, and this thing unmanned them.\r\nYou will no doubt recall Keats's poem about stout Cortez staring with\r\neagle eyes at the Pacific while all his men gazed at each other with a\r\nwild surmise, silent upon a peak in Darien. Precisely so did Peter\r\nWillard and James Todd stare with eagle eyes at the second lake hole,\r\nand gaze at each other with a wild surmise, silent upon a tee in\r\nWoodhaven. They had dreamed of such a happening so often and woke to\r\nfind the vision false, that at first they could not believe that the\r\nthing had actually occurred.\r\n\r\n\"I got over!\" whispered James, in an awed voice.\r\n\r\n\"So did I!\" muttered Peter.\r\n\r\n\"In one!\"\r\n\r\n\"With my very first!\"\r\n\r\nThey walked in silence round the edge of the lake, and holed out. One\r\nputt was enough for each, and they halved the hole with a two. Peter's\r\nprevious record was eight, and James had once done a seven. There are\r\ntimes when strong men lose their self-control, and this was one of\r\nthem. They reached the third tee in a daze, and it was here that\r\nmortification began to set in.\r\n\r\nThe third hole is another bogey four, up the hill and past the tree\r\nthat serves as a direction-post, the hole itself being out of sight. On\r\nhis day, James had often done it in ten and Peter in nine; but now they\r\nwere unnerved. James, who had the honour, shook visibly as he addressed\r\nhis ball. Three times he swung and only connected with the ozone; the\r\nfourth time he topped badly. The discs had been set back a little way,\r\nand James had the mournful distinction of breaking a record for the\r\ncourse by playing his fifth shot from the tee. It was a low, raking\r\nbrassey-shot, which carried a heap of stones twenty feet to the right\r\nand finished in a furrow. Peter, meanwhile, had popped up a lofty ball\r\nwhich came to rest behind a stone.\r\n\r\nIt was now that the rigid rules governing this contest began to take\r\ntheir toll. Had they been playing an ordinary friendly round, each\r\nwould have teed up on some convenient hillock and probably been past\r\nthe tree with their second, for James would, in ordinary circumstances,\r\nhave taken his drive back and regarded the strokes he had made as a\r\nlittle preliminary practice to get him into midseason form. But today\r\nit was war to the niblick, and neither man asked nor expected quarter.\r\nPeter's seventh shot dislodged the stone, leaving him a clear field,\r\nand James, with his eleventh, extricated himself from the furrow. Fifty\r\nfeet from the tree James was eighteen, Peter twelve; but then the\r\nlatter, as every golfer does at times, suddenly went right off his\r\ngame. He hit the tree four times, then hooked into the sand-bunkers to\r\nthe left of the hole. James, who had been playing a game that was\r\nsteady without being brilliant, was on the green in twenty-six, Peter\r\ntaking twenty-seven. Poor putting lost James the hole. Peter was down\r\nin thirty-three, but the pace was too hot for James. He missed a\r\ntwo-foot putt for the half, and they went to the fourth tee all square.\r\n\r\nThe fourth hole follows the curve of the road, on the other side of\r\nwhich are picturesque woods. It presents no difficulties to the expert,\r\nbut it has pitfalls for the novice. The dashing player stands for a\r\nslice, while the more cautious are satisfied if they can clear the\r\nbunker that spans the fairway and lay their ball well out to the left,\r\nwhence an iron shot will take them to the green. Peter and James\r\ncombined the two policies. Peter aimed to the left and got a slice, and\r\nJames, also aiming to the left, topped into the bunker. Peter,\r\nrealizing from experience the futility of searching for his ball in the\r\nwoods, drove a second, which also disappeared into the jungle, as did\r\nhis third. By the time he had joined James in the bunker he had played\r\nhis sixth.\r\n\r\nIt is the glorious uncertainty of golf that makes it the game it is.\r\nThe fact that James and Peter, lying side by side in the same bunker,\r\nhad played respectively one and six shots, might have induced an\r\nunthinking observer to fancy the chances of the former. And no doubt,\r\nhad he not taken seven strokes to extricate himself from the pit, while\r\nhis opponent, by some act of God, contrived to get out in two, James's\r\nchances might have been extremely rosy. As it was, the two men\r\nstaggered out on to the fairway again with a score of eight apiece.\r\nOnce past the bunker and round the bend of the road, the hole becomes\r\nsimple. A judicious use of the cleek put Peter on the green in\r\nfourteen, while James, with a Braid iron, reached it in twelve. Peter\r\nwas down in seventeen, and James contrived to halve. It was only as he\r\nwas leaving the hole that the latter discovered that he had been\r\nputting with his niblick, which cannot have failed to exercise a\r\nprejudicial effect on his game. These little incidents are bound to\r\nhappen when one is in a nervous and highly-strung condition.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and sixth holes produced no unusual features. Peter won the\r\nfifth in eleven, and James the sixth in ten. The short seventh they\r\nhalved in nine. The eighth, always a tricky hole, they took no\r\nliberties with, James, sinking a long putt with his twenty-third, just\r\nmanaging to halve. A ding-dong race up the hill for the ninth found\r\nJames first at the pin, and they finished the first nine with James one\r\nup.\r\n\r\nAs they left the green James looked a little furtively at his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"You might be strolling on to the tenth,\" he said. \"I want to get a few\r\nballs at the shop. And my mashie wants fixing up. I sha'n't be long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come with you,\" said Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother,\" said James. \"You go on and hold our place at the tee.\"\r\n\r\nI regret to say that James was lying. His mashie was in excellent\r\nrepair, and he still had a dozen balls in his bag, it being his prudent\r\npractice always to start out with eighteen. No! What he had said was\r\nmere subterfuge. He wanted to go to his locker and snatch a few minutes\r\nwith Sandy MacBean's \"How to Become a Scratch Man\". He felt sure that\r\none more glance at the photograph of Mr. MacBean driving would give him\r\nthe mastery of the stroke and so enable him to win the match. In this I\r\nthink he was a little sanguine. The difficulty about Sandy MacBean's\r\nmethod of tuition was that he laid great stress on the fact that the\r\nball should be directly in a line with a point exactly in the centre of\r\nthe back of the player's neck; and so far James's efforts to keep his\r\neye on the ball and on the back of his neck simultaneously had produced\r\nno satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seemed to James, when he joined Peter on the tenth tee, that the\r\nlatter's manner was strange. He was pale. There was a curious look in\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\n\"James, old man,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"While you were away I have been thinking. James, old man, do you\r\nreally love this girl?\"\r\n\r\nJames stared. A spasm of pain twisted Peter's face.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" he said in a low voice, \"she were not all you--we--think she\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Forrester is an angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes. Quite so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what it is,\" said James, passionately. \"You're trying to put me\r\noff my stroke. You know that the least thing makes me lose my form.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"You hope that you can take my mind off the game and make me go to\r\npieces, and then you'll win the match.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Peter. \"I intend to forfeit the match.\"\r\n\r\nJames reeled.\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"I give up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but----\" James shook with emotion. His voice quavered. \"Ah!\" he\r\ncried. \"I see now: I understand! You are doing this for me because I am\r\nyour pal. Peter, this is noble! This is the sort of thing you read\r\nabout in books. I've seen it in the movies. But I can't accept the\r\nsacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"I insist!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I give her up, James, old man. I--I hope you will be happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't know what to say. How can I thank you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't thank me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Peter, do you fully realize what you are doing? True, I am one\r\nup, but there are nine holes to go, and I am not right on my game\r\ntoday. You might easily beat me. Have you forgotten that I once took\r\nforty-seven at the dog-leg hole? This may be one of my bad days. Do you\r\nunderstand that if you insist on giving up I shall go to Miss Forrester\r\ntonight and propose to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you stick to it that you are through?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. And, by the way, there's no need for you to wait till tonight.\r\nI saw Miss Forrester just now outside the tennis court. She's alone.\"\r\n\r\nJames turned crimson.\r\n\r\n\"Then I think perhaps----\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better go to her at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\" James extended his hand. \"Peter, old man, I shall never\r\nforget this.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, do you mean? Oh, I shall potter round the second nine. If you\r\nwant me, you'll find me somewhere about.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll come to the wedding, Peter?\" said James, wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Peter. \"Good luck.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke cheerily, but, when the other had turned to go, he stood\r\nlooking after him thoughtfully. Then he sighed a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJames approached Miss Forrester with a beating heart. She made a\r\ncharming picture as she stood there in the sunlight, one hand on her\r\nhip, the other swaying a tennis racket.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Mr. Todd? Have you been playing golf?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"With Mr. Willard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We were having a match.\"\r\n\r\n\"Golf,\" said Grace Forrester, \"seems to make men very rude. Mr. Willard\r\nleft me without a word in the middle of our conversation.\"\r\n\r\nJames was astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Were you talking to Peter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Just now. I can't understand what was the matter with him. He\r\njust turned on his heel and swung off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You oughtn't to turn on your heel when you swing,\" said James; \"only\r\non the ball of the foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, nothing. I wasn't thinking. The fact is, I've something on my\r\nmind. So has Peter. You mustn't think too hardly of him. We have been\r\nplaying an important match, and it must have got on his nerves. You\r\ndidn't happen by any chance to be watching us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I wish you had seen me at the lake-hole. I did it one under par.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was your father playing?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand. I mean I did it in one better than even the\r\nfinest player is supposed to do it. It's a mashie-shot, you know. You\r\nmustn't play too light, or you fall in the lake; and you mustn't play\r\nit too hard, or you go past the hole into the woods. It requires the\r\nnicest delicacy and judgment, such as I gave it. You might have to wait\r\na year before seeing anyone do it in two again. I doubt if the 'pro.'\r\noften does it in two. Now, directly we came to this hole today, I made\r\nup my mind that there was going to be no mistake. The great secret of\r\nany shot at golf is ease, elegance, and the ability to relax. The\r\nmajority of men, you will find, think it important that their address\r\nshould be good.\"\r\n\r\n\"How snobbish! What does it matter where a man lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't absolutely follow me. I refer to the waggle and the stance\r\nbefore you make the stroke. Most players seem to fix in their minds the\r\nappearance of the angles which are presented by the position of the\r\narms, legs, and club shaft, and it is largely the desire to retain\r\nthese angles which results in their moving their heads and stiffening\r\ntheir muscles so that there is no freedom in the swing. There is only\r\none point which vitally affects the stroke, and the only reason why\r\nthat should be kept constant is that you are enabled to see your ball\r\nclearly. That is the pivotal point marked at the base of the neck, and\r\na line drawn from this point to the ball should be at right angles to\r\nthe line of flight.\"\r\n\r\nJames paused for a moment for air, and as he paused Miss Forrester\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"This is all gibberish to me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Gibberish!\" gasped James. \"I am quoting verbatim from one of the best\r\nauthorities on golf.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Forrester swung her tennis racket irritably.\r\n\r\n\"Golf,\" she said, \"bores me pallid. I think it is the silliest game\r\never invented!\"\r\n\r\nThe trouble about telling a story is that words are so feeble a means\r\nof depicting the supreme moments of life. That is where the artist has\r\nthe advantage over the historian. Were I an artist, I should show James\r\nat this point falling backwards with his feet together and his eyes\r\nshut, with a semi-circular dotted line marking the progress of his\r\nflight and a few stars above his head to indicate moral collapse. There\r\nare no words that can adequately describe the sheer, black horror that\r\nfroze the blood in his veins as this frightful speech smote his ears.\r\n\r\nHe had never inquired into Miss Forrester's religious views before, but\r\nhe had always assumed that they were sound. And now here she was\r\npolluting the golden summer air with the most hideous blasphemy. It\r\nwould be incorrect to say that James's love was turned to hate. He did\r\nnot hate Grace. The repulsion he felt was deeper than mere hate. What\r\nhe felt was not altogether loathing and not wholly pity. It was a blend\r\nof the two.\r\n\r\nThere was a tense silence. The listening world stood still. Then,\r\nwithout a word, James Todd turned and tottered away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeter was working moodily in the twelfth bunker when his friend\r\narrived. He looked up with a start. Then, seeing that the other was\r\nalone, he came forward hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Am I to congratulate you?\"\r\n\r\nJames breathed a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"You are!\" he said. \"On an escape!\"\r\n\r\n\"She refused you?\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't get the chance. Old man, have you ever sent one right up\r\nthe edge of that bunker in front of the seventh and just not gone in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very rarely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did once. It was my second shot, from a good lie, with the light\r\niron, and I followed well through and thought I had gone just too far,\r\nand, when I walked up, there was my ball on the edge of the bunker,\r\nnicely teed up on a chunk of grass, so that I was able to lay it dead\r\nwith my mashie-niblick, holing out in six. Well, what I mean to say is,\r\nI feel now as I felt then--as if some unseen power had withheld me in\r\ntime from some frightful disaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know just how you feel,\" said Peter, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Peter, old man, that girl said golf bored her pallid. She said she\r\nthought it was the silliest game ever invented.\" He paused to mark the\r\neffect of his words. Peter merely smiled a faint, wan smile. \"You don't\r\nseem revolted,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"I am revolted, but not surprised. You see, she said the same thing to\r\nme only a few minutes before.\"\r\n\r\n\"She did!\"\r\n\r\n\"It amounted to the same thing. I had just been telling her how I did\r\nthe lake-hole today in two, and she said that in her opinion golf was a\r\ngame for children with water on the brain who weren't athletic enough\r\nto play Animal Grab.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men shivered in sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"There must be insanity in the family,\" said James at last.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Peter, \"is the charitable explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were fortunate to find it out in time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were!\"\r\n\r\n\"We mustn't run a risk like that again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never again!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better take up golf really seriously. It will keep us\r\nout of mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're quite right. We ought to do our four rounds a day regularly.\"\r\n\r\n\"In spring, summer, and autumn. And in winter it would be rash not to\r\npractise most of the day at one of those indoor schools.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to be safe that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter, old man,\" said James, \"I've been meaning to speak to you about\r\nit for some time. I've got Sandy MacBean's new book, and I think you\r\nought to read it. It is full of helpful hints.\"\r\n\r\n\"James!\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter!\"\r\n\r\nSilently the two men clasped hands. James Todd and Peter Willard were\r\nthemselves again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so (said the Oldest Member) we come back to our original\r\nstarting-point--to wit, that, while there is nothing to be said\r\ndefinitely against love, your golfer should be extremely careful how he\r\nindulges in it. It may improve his game or it may not. But, if he finds\r\nthat there is any danger that it may not--if the object of his\r\naffections is not the kind of girl who will listen to him with cheerful\r\nsympathy through the long evenings, while he tells her, illustrating\r\nstance and grip and swing with the kitchen poker, each detail of the\r\nday's round--then, I say unhesitatingly, he had better leave it alone.\r\nLove has had a lot of press-agenting from the oldest times; but there\r\nare higher, nobler things than love. A woman is only a woman, but a\r\nhefty drive is a slosh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n_A Mixed Threesome_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the holiday season, and during the holidays the Greens\r\nCommittees have decided that the payment of twenty guineas shall\r\nentitle fathers of families not only to infest the course themselves,\r\nbut also to decant their nearest and dearest upon it in whatever\r\nquantity they please. All over the links, in consequence, happy,\r\nlaughing groups of children had broken out like a rash. A wan-faced\r\nadult, who had been held up for ten minutes while a drove of issue\r\nquarrelled over whether little Claude had taken two hundred or two\r\nhundred and twenty approach shots to reach the ninth green sank into a\r\nseat beside the Oldest Member.\r\n\r\n\"What luck?\" inquired the Sage.\r\n\r\n\"None to speak of,\" returned the other, moodily. \"I thought I had\r\nbagged a small boy in a Lord Fauntleroy suit on the sixth, but he\r\nducked. These children make me tired. They should be bowling their\r\nhoops in the road. Golf is a game for grownups. How can a fellow play,\r\nwith a platoon of progeny blocking him at every hole?\"\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member shook his head. He could not subscribe to these\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nNo doubt (said the Oldest Member) the summer golf-child is, from the\r\npoint of view of the player who likes to get round the course in a\r\nsingle afternoon, something of a trial; but, personally, I confess, it\r\npleases me to see my fellow human beings--and into this category\r\ngolf-children, though at the moment you may not be broad-minded enough\r\nto admit it, undoubtedly fall--taking to the noblest of games at an\r\nearly age. Golf, like measles, should be caught young, for, if\r\npostponed to riper years, the results may be serious. Let me tell you\r\nthe story of Mortimer Sturgis, which illustrates what I mean rather\r\naptly.\r\n\r\nMortimer Sturgis, when I first knew him, was a care-free man of\r\nthirty-eight, of amiable character and independent means, which he\r\nincreased from time to time by judicious ventures on the Stock\r\nExchange. Although he had never played golf, his had not been\r\naltogether an ill-spent life. He swung a creditable racket at tennis,\r\nwas always ready to contribute a baritone solo to charity concerts, and\r\ngave freely to the poor. He was what you might call a golden-mean man,\r\ngood-hearted rather than magnetic, with no serious vices and no heroic\r\nvirtues. For a hobby, he had taken up the collecting of porcelain\r\nvases, and he was engaged to Betty Weston, a charming girl of\r\ntwenty-five, a lifelong friend of mine.\r\n\r\nI like Mortimer. Everybody liked him. But, at the same time, I was a\r\nlittle surprised that a girl like Betty should have become engaged to\r\nhim. As I said before, he was not magnetic; and magnetism, I thought,\r\nwas the chief quality she would have demanded in a man. Betty was one\r\nof those ardent, vivid girls, with an intense capacity for\r\nhero-worship, and I would have supposed that something more in the\r\nnature of a plumed knight or a corsair of the deep would have been her\r\nideal. But, of course, if there is a branch of modern industry where\r\nthe demand is greater than the supply, it is the manufacture of knights\r\nand corsairs; and nowadays a girl, however flaming her aspirations, has\r\nto take the best she can get. I must admit that Betty seemed perfectly\r\ncontent with Mortimer.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the state of affairs when Eddie Denton arrived, and the\r\ntrouble began.\r\n\r\nI was escorting Betty home one evening after a tea-party at which we\r\nhad been fellow-guests, when, walking down the road, we happened to\r\nespy Mortimer. He broke into a run when he saw us, and galloped up,\r\nwaving a piece of paper in his hand. He was plainly excited, a thing\r\nwhich was unusual in this well-balanced man. His broad, good-humoured\r\nface was working violently.\r\n\r\n\"Good news!\" he cried. \"Good news! Dear old Eddie's back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how nice for you, dear!\" said Betty. \"Eddie Denton is Mortimer's\r\nbest friend,\" she explained to me. \"He has told me so much about him. I\r\nhave been looking forward to his coming home. Mortie thinks the world\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\n\"So will you, when you know him,\" cried Mortimer. \"Dear old Eddie! He's\r\na wonder! The best fellow on earth! We were at school and the 'Varsity\r\ntogether. There's nobody like Eddie! He landed yesterday. Just home\r\nfrom Central Africa. He's an explorer, you know,\" he said to me.\r\n\"Spends all his time in places where it's death for a white man to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"An explorer!\" I heard Betty breathe, as if to herself. I was not so\r\nimpressed, I fear, as she was. Explorers, as a matter of fact, leave me\r\na trifle cold. It has always seemed to me that the difficulties of\r\ntheir life are greatly exaggerated--generally by themselves. In a large\r\ncountry like Africa, for instance, I should imagine that it was almost\r\nimpossible for a man not to get somewhere if he goes on long enough.\r\nGive _me_ the fellow who can plunge into the bowels of the earth\r\nat Piccadilly Circus and find the right Tube train with nothing but a\r\nlot of misleading signs to guide him. However, we are not all\r\nconstituted alike in this world, and it was apparent from the flush on\r\nher cheek and the light in her eyes that Betty admired explorers.\r\n\r\n\"I wired to him at once,\" went on Mortimer, \"and insisted on his coming\r\ndown here. It's two years since I saw him. You don't know how I have\r\nlooked forward, dear, to you and Eddie meeting. He is just your sort. I\r\nknow how romantic you are and keen on adventure and all that. Well,\r\nyou should hear Eddie tell the story of how he brought down the\r\nbull _bongo_ with his last cartridge after all the _pongos_, or\r\nnative bearers, had fled into the _dongo_, or undergrowth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should love to!\" whispered Betty, her eyes glowing. I suppose to an\r\nimpressionable girl these things really are of absorbing interest. For\r\nmyself, _bongos_ intrigue me even less than _pongos_, while\r\n_dongos_ frankly bore me. \"When do you expect him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will get my wire tonight. I'm hoping we shall see the dear old\r\nfellow tomorrow afternoon some time. How surprised old Eddie will be to\r\nhear that I'm engaged. He's such a confirmed bachelor himself. He told\r\nme once that he considered the wisest thing ever said by human tongue\r\nwas the Swahili proverb--'Whoso taketh a woman into his kraal\r\ndepositeth himself straightway in the _wongo_.' _Wongo_, he\r\ntells me, is a sort of broth composed of herbs and meat-bones,\r\ncorresponding to our soup. You must get Eddie to give it you in the\r\noriginal Swahili. It sounds even better.\"\r\n\r\nI saw the girl's eyes flash, and there came into her face that peculiar\r\nset expression which married men know. It passed in an instant, but not\r\nbefore it had given me material for thought which lasted me all the way\r\nto my house and into the silent watches of the night. I was fond of\r\nMortimer Sturgis, and I could see trouble ahead for him as plainly as\r\nthough I had been a palmist reading his hand at two guineas a visit.\r\nThere are other proverbs fully as wise as the one which Mortimer had\r\ntranslated from the Swahili, and one of the wisest is that quaint old\r\nEast London saying, handed down from one generation of costermongers to\r\nanother, and whispered at midnight in the wigwams of the whelk-seller!\r\n\"Never introduce your donah to a pal.\" In those seven words is\r\ncontained the wisdom of the ages. I could read the future so plainly.\r\nWhat but one thing could happen after Mortimer had influenced Betty's\r\nimagination with his stories of his friend's romantic career, and added\r\nthe finishing touch by advertising him as a woman-hater? He might just\r\nas well have asked for his ring back at once. My heart bled for\r\nMortimer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI happened to call at his house on the second evening of the explorer's\r\nvisit, and already the mischief had been done.\r\n\r\nDenton was one of those lean, hard-bitten men with smouldering eyes and\r\na brick-red complexion. He looked what he was, the man of action and\r\nenterprise. He had the wiry frame and strong jaw without which no\r\nexplorer is complete, and Mortimer, beside him, seemed but a poor, soft\r\nproduct of our hot-house civilization. Mortimer, I forgot to say, wore\r\nglasses; and, if there is one time more than another when a man should\r\nnot wear glasses, it is while a strong-faced, keen-eyed wanderer in the\r\nwilds is telling a beautiful girl the story of his adventures.\r\n\r\nFor this was what Denton was doing. My arrival seemed to have\r\ninterrupted him in the middle of narrative. He shook my hand in a\r\nstrong, silent sort of way, and resumed:\r\n\r\n\"Well, the natives seemed fairly friendly, so I decided to stay the\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nI made a mental note never to seem fairly friendly to an explorer. If\r\nyou do, he always decides to stay the night.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning they took me down to the river. At this point it widens\r\ninto a _kongo_, or pool, and it was here, they told me, that the\r\ncrocodile mostly lived, subsisting on the native oxen--the short-horned\r\n_jongos_--which, swept away by the current while crossing the ford\r\nabove, were carried down on the _longos_, or rapids. It was not,\r\nhowever, till the second evening that I managed to catch sight of his\r\nugly snout above the surface. I waited around, and on the third day I\r\nsaw him suddenly come out of the water and heave his whole length on to\r\na sandbank in mid-stream and go to sleep in the sun. He was certainly a\r\nmonster--fully thirty--you have never been in Central Africa, have you,\r\nMiss Weston? No? You ought to go there!--fully fifty feet from tip to\r\ntail. There he lay, glistening. I shall never forget the sight.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off to light a cigarette. I heard Betty draw in her breath\r\nsharply. Mortimer was beaming through his glasses with the air of the\r\nowner of a dog which is astonishing a drawing-room with its clever\r\ntricks.\r\n\r\n\"And what did you do then, Mr. Denton?\" asked Betty, breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, what did you do then, old chap?\" said Mortimer.\r\n\r\nDenton blew out the match and dropped it on the ash-tray.\r\n\r\n\"Eh? Oh,\" he said, carelessly, \"I swam across and shot him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swam across and shot him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It seemed to me that the chance was too good to be missed. Of\r\ncourse, I might have had a pot at him from the bank, but the chances\r\nwere I wouldn't have hit him in a vital place. So I swam across to the\r\nsandbank, put the muzzle of my gun in his mouth, and pulled the\r\ntrigger. I have rarely seen a crocodile so taken aback.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how dreadfully dangerous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, danger!\" Eddie Denton laughed lightly. \"One drops into the habit\r\nof taking a few risks out there, you know. Talking of _danger_,\r\nthe time when things really did look a little nasty was when the\r\nwounded _gongo_ cornered me in a narrow _tongo_ and I only had\r\na pocket-knife with everything in it broken except the corkscrew\r\nand the thing for taking stones out of horses' hoofs. It was like\r\nthis----\"\r\n\r\nI could bear no more. I am a tender-hearted man, and I made some excuse\r\nand got away. From the expression on the girl's face I could see that\r\nit was only a question of days before she gave her heart to this\r\nromantic newcomer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it was on the following afternoon that she called\r\non me and told me that the worst had happened. I had known her from a\r\nchild, you understand, and she always confided her troubles to me.\r\n\r\n\"I want your advice,\" she began. \"I'm so wretched!\"\r\n\r\nShe burst into tears. I could see the poor girl was in a highly nervous\r\ncondition, so I did my best to calm her by describing how I had once\r\ndone the long hole in four. My friends tell me that there is no finer\r\nsoporific, and it seemed as though they may be right, for presently,\r\njust as I had reached the point where I laid my approach-putt dead from\r\na distance of fifteen feet, she became quieter. She dried her eyes,\r\nyawned once or twice, and looked at me bravely.\r\n\r\n\"I love Eddie Denton!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I feared as much. When did you feel this coming on?\"\r\n\r\n\"It crashed on me like a thunderbolt last night after dinner. We were\r\nwalking in the garden, and he was just telling me how he had been\r\nbitten by a poisonous _zongo_, when I seemed to go all giddy. When\r\nI came to myself I was in Eddie's arms. His face was pressed against\r\nmine, and he was gargling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gargling?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so at first. But he reassured me. He was merely speaking in\r\none of the lesser-known dialects of the Walla-Walla natives of Eastern\r\nUganda, into which he always drops in moments of great emotion. He soon\r\nrecovered sufficiently to give me a rough translation, and then I knew\r\nthat he loved me. He kissed me. I kissed him. We kissed each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where was Mortimer all this while?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indoors, cataloguing his collection of vases.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, I confess, I was inclined to abandon Mortimer's cause. A\r\nman, I felt, who could stay indoors cataloguing vases while his\r\n_fiancee_ wandered in the moonlight with explorers deserved all\r\nthat was coming to him. I overcame the feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Have you told him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think it might be of interest to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell him? It would break his heart. I am awfully fond of\r\nMortimer. So is Eddie. We would both die rather than do anything to\r\nhurt him. Eddie is the soul of honour. He agrees with me that Mortimer\r\nmust never know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you aren't going to break off your engagement?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't. Eddie feels the same. He says that, unless something can\r\nbe done, he will say good-bye to me and creep far, far away to some\r\ndistant desert, and there, in the great stillness, broken only by the\r\ncry of the prowling _yongo_, try to forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you say 'unless something can be done,' what do you mean? What\r\ncan be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you might have something to suggest. Don't you think it\r\npossible that somehow Mortimer might take it into his head to break the\r\nengagement himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absurd! He loves you devotedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so. Only the other day I dropped one of his best vases, and\r\nhe just smiled and said it didn't matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can give you even better proof than that. This morning Mortimer came\r\nto me and asked me to give him secret lessons in golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Golf! But he despises golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. But he is going to learn it for your sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why secret lessons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he wants to keep it a surprise for your birthday. Now can you\r\ndoubt his love?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not worthy of him!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nThe words gave me an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" I said, \"we could convince Mortimer of that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose, for instance, he could be made to believe that you were, let\r\nus say, a dipsomaniac.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"He knows that already.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I told him I sometimes walked in my sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean a secret drinker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will induce me to pretend to be a secret drinker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then a drug-fiend?\" I suggested, hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"I hate medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it!\" I said. \"A kleptomaniac.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"A person who steals things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's horrid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. It's a perfectly ladylike thing to do. You don't know you\r\ndo it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, if I don't know I do it, how do I know I do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, how can I tell Mortimer I do it if I don't know?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't tell him. I will tell him. I will inform him tomorrow that\r\nyou called on me this afternoon and stole my watch and\"--I glanced\r\nabout the room--\"my silver matchbox.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather have that little vinaigrette.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't get either. I merely say you stole it. What will happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer will hit you with a cleek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I am an old man. My white hairs protect me. What he will\r\ndo is to insist on confronting me with you and asking you to deny the\r\nfoul charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you admit it and release him from his engagement.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat for a while in silence. I could see that my words had made an\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's a splendid idea. Thank you very much.\" She rose and moved\r\nto the door. \"I knew you would suggest something wonderful.\" She\r\nhesitated. \"You don't think it would make it sound more plausible if I\r\nreally took the vinaigrette?\" she added, a little wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"It would spoil everything,\" I replied, firmly, as I reached for the\r\nvinaigrette and locked it carefully in my desk.\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment, and her glance fell on the carpet. That,\r\nhowever, did not worry me. It was nailed down.\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-bye,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"_Au revoir_,\" I replied. \"I am meeting Mortimer at six-thirty\r\ntomorrow. You may expect us round at your house at about eight.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMortimer was punctual at the tryst next morning. When I reached the\r\ntenth tee he was already there. We exchanged a brief greeting and I\r\nhanded him a driver, outlined the essentials of grip and swing, and\r\nbade him go to it.\r\n\r\n\"It seems a simple game,\" he said, as he took his stance. \"You're sure\r\nit's fair to have the ball sitting up on top of a young sand-hill like\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, I don't want to be coddled because I'm a beginner.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ball is always teed up for the drive,\" I assured him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, if you say so. But it seems to me to take all the element of\r\nsport out of the game. Where do I hit it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, straight ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't it dangerous? I mean, suppose I smash a window in that house\r\nover there?\"\r\n\r\nHe indicated a charming bijou residence some five hundred yards down\r\nthe fairway.\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" I replied, \"the owner comes out in his pyjamas and\r\noffers you the choice between some nuts and a cigar.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed reassured, and began to address the ball. Then he paused\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there something you say before you start?\" he asked. \"'Five', or\r\nsomething?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may say 'Fore!' if it makes you feel any easier. But it isn't\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am going to learn this silly game,\" said Mortimer, firmly, \"I am\r\ngoing to learn it _right_. Fore!\"\r\n\r\nI watched him curiously. I never put a club into the hand of a beginner\r\nwithout something of the feeling of the sculptor who surveys a mass of\r\nshapeless clay. I experience the emotions of a creator. Here, I say to\r\nmyself, is a semi-sentient being into whose soulless carcass I am\r\nbreathing life. A moment before, he was, though technically living, a\r\nmere clod. A moment hence he will be a golfer.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still occupied with these meditations Mortimer swung at the\r\nball. The club, whizzing down, brushed the surface of the rubber\r\nsphere, toppling it off the tee and propelling it six inches with a\r\nslight slice on it.\r\n\r\n\"Damnation!\" said Mortimer, unravelling himself.\r\n\r\nI nodded approvingly. His drive had not been anything to write to the\r\ngolfing journals about, but he was picking up the technique of the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n\"What happened then?\"\r\n\r\nI told him in a word.\r\n\r\n\"Your stance was wrong, and your grip was wrong, and you moved your\r\nhead, and swayed your body, and took your eye off the ball, and\r\npressed, and forgot to use your wrists, and swung back too fast, and\r\nlet the hands get ahead of the club, and lost your balance, and omitted\r\nto pivot on the ball of the left foot, and bent your right knee.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"There is more in this pastime,\" he said, \"than the casual observer\r\nwould suspect.\"\r\n\r\nI have noticed, and I suppose other people have noticed, that in the\r\ngolf education of every man there is a definite point at which he may\r\nbe said to have crossed the dividing line--the Rubicon, as it\r\nwere--that separates the golfer from the non-golfer. This moment comes\r\nimmediately after his first good drive. In the ninety minutes in which\r\nI instructed Mortimer Sturgis that morning in the rudiments of the\r\ngame, he made every variety of drive known to science; but it was not\r\ntill we were about to leave that he made a good one.\r\n\r\nA moment before he had surveyed his blistered hands with sombre\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good,\" he said. \"I shall never learn this beast of a game. And\r\nI don't want to either. It's only fit for lunatics. Where's the sense\r\nin it? Hitting a rotten little ball with a stick! If I want exercise,\r\nI'll take a stick and go and rattle it along the railings. There's\r\nsomething _in_ that! Well, let's be getting along. No good wasting\r\nthe whole morning out here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try one more drive, and then we'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. If you like. No sense in it, though.\"\r\n\r\nHe teed up the ball, took a careless stance, and flicked moodily. There\r\nwas a sharp crack, the ball shot off the tee, flew a hundred yards in a\r\ndead straight line never ten feet above the ground, soared another\r\nseventy yards in a graceful arc, struck the turf, rolled, and came to\r\nrest within easy mashie distance of the green.\r\n\r\n\"Splendid!\" I cried.\r\n\r\nThe man seemed stunned.\r\n\r\n\"How did that happen?\"\r\n\r\nI told him very simply.\r\n\r\n\"Your stance was right, and your grip was right, and you kept your head\r\nstill, and didn't sway your body, and never took your eye off the ball,\r\nand slowed back, and let the arms come well through, and rolled the\r\nwrists, and let the club-head lead, and kept your balance, and pivoted\r\non the ball of the left foot, and didn't duck the right knee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he said. \"Yes, I thought that must be it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now let's go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute. I just want to remember what I did while it's fresh in\r\nmy mind. Let me see, this was the way I stood. Or was it more like\r\nthis? No, like this.\" He turned to me, beaming. \"What a great idea it\r\nwas, my taking up golf! It's all nonsense what you read in the comic\r\npapers about people foozling all over the place and breaking clubs and\r\nall that. You've only to exercise a little reasonable care. And what a\r\ncorking game it is! Nothing like it in the world! I wonder if Betty is\r\nup yet. I must go round and show her how I did that drive. A perfect\r\nswing, with every ounce of weight, wrist, and muscle behind it. I meant\r\nto keep it a secret from the dear girl till I had really learned, but\r\nof course I _have_ learned now. Let's go round and rout her out.\"\r\n\r\nHe had given me my cue. I put my hand on his shoulder and spoke\r\nsorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer, my boy, I fear I have bad news for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Slow; back--keep the head---- What's that? Bad news?\"\r\n\r\n\"About Betty.\"\r\n\r\n\"About Betty? What about her? Don't sway the body--keep the eye on\r\nthe----\"\r\n\r\n\"Prepare yourself for a shock, my boy. Yesterday afternoon Betty called\r\nto see me. When she had gone I found that she had stolen my silver\r\nmatchbox.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stolen your matchbox?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stolen my matchbox.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, I dare say there were faults on both sides,\" said Mortimer.\r\n\"Tell me if I sway my body this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't grasp what I have said! Do you realize that Betty, the girl\r\nyou are going to marry, is a kleptomaniac?\"\r\n\r\n\"A kleptomaniac!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the only possible explanation. Think what this means, my boy.\r\nThink how you will feel every time your wife says she is going out to\r\ndo a little shopping! Think of yourself, left alone at home, watching\r\nthe clock, saying to yourself, 'Now she is lifting a pair of silk\r\nstockings!' 'Now she is hiding gloves in her umbrella!' 'Just about\r\nthis moment she is getting away with a pearl necklace!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Would she do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"She would! She could not help herself. Or, rather, she could not\r\nrefrain from helping herself. How about it, my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"It only draws us closer together,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI was touched, I own. My scheme had failed, but it had proved Mortimer\r\nSturgis to be of pure gold. He stood gazing down the fairway, wrapped\r\nin thought.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" he said, meditatively, \"I wonder if the dear girl ever\r\ngoes to any of those sales--those auction-sales, you know, where you're\r\nallowed to inspect the things the day before? They often have some\r\npretty decent vases.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off and fell into a reverie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this point onward Mortimer Sturgis proved the truth of what I said\r\nto you about the perils of taking up golf at an advanced age. A\r\nlifetime of observing my fellow-creatures has convinced me that Nature\r\nintended us all to be golfers. In every human being the germ of golf is\r\nimplanted at birth, and suppression causes it to grow and grow till--it\r\nmay be at forty, fifty, sixty--it suddenly bursts its bonds and sweeps\r\nover the victim like a tidal wave. The wise man, who begins to play in\r\nchildhood, is enabled to let the poison exude gradually from his\r\nsystem, with no harmful results. But a man like Mortimer Sturgis, with\r\nthirty-eight golfless years behind him, is swept off his feet. He is\r\ncarried away. He loses all sense of proportion. He is like the fly that\r\nhappens to be sitting on the wall of the dam just when the crack comes.\r\n\r\nMortimer Sturgis gave himself up without a struggle to an orgy of golf\r\nsuch as I have never witnessed in any man. Within two days of that\r\nfirst lesson he had accumulated a collection of clubs large enough to\r\nhave enabled him to open a shop; and he went on buying them at the rate\r\nof two and three a day. On Sundays, when it was impossible to buy\r\nclubs, he was like a lost spirit. True, he would do his regular four\r\nrounds on the day of rest, but he never felt happy. The thought, as he\r\nsliced into the rough, that the patent wooden-faced cleek which he\r\nintended to purchase next morning might have made all the difference,\r\ncompletely spoiled his enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI remember him calling me up on the telephone at three o'clock one\r\nmorning to tell me that he had solved the problem of putting. He\r\nintended in future, he said, to use a croquet mallet, and he wondered\r\nthat no one had ever thought of it before. The sound of his broken\r\ngroan when I informed him that croquet mallets were against the rules\r\nhaunted me for days.\r\n\r\nHis golf library kept pace with his collection of clubs. He bought all\r\nthe standard works, subscribed to all the golfing papers, and, when he\r\ncame across a paragraph in a magazine to the effect that Mr. Hutchings,\r\nan ex-amateur champion, did not begin to play till he was past forty,\r\nand that his opponent in the final, Mr. S. H. Fry, had never held a club\r\ntill his thirty-fifth year, he had it engraved on vellum and framed and\r\nhung up beside his shaving-mirror.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd Betty, meanwhile? She, poor child, stared down the years into a\r\nbleak future, in which she saw herself parted for ever from the man she\r\nloved, and the golf-widow of another for whom--even when he won a medal\r\nfor lowest net at a weekly handicap with a score of a hundred and three\r\nminus twenty-four--she could feel nothing warmer than respect. Those\r\nwere dreary days for Betty. We three--she and I and Eddie Denton--often\r\ntalked over Mortimer's strange obsession. Denton said that, except that\r\nMortimer had not come out in pink spots, his symptoms were almost\r\nidentical with those of the dreaded _mongo-mongo_, the scourge of\r\nthe West African hinterland. Poor Denton! He had already booked his\r\npassage for Africa, and spent hours looking in the atlas for good\r\ndeserts.\r\n\r\nIn every fever of human affairs there comes at last the crisis. We may\r\nemerge from it healed or we may plunge into still deeper depths of\r\nsoul-sickness; but always the crisis comes. I was privileged to be\r\npresent when it came in the affairs of Mortimer Sturgis and Betty\r\nWeston.\r\n\r\nI had gone into the club-house one afternoon at an hour when it is\r\nusually empty, and the first thing I saw, as I entered the main room,\r\nwhich looks out on the ninth green, was Mortimer. He was grovelling on\r\nthe floor, and I confess that, when I caught sight of him, my heart\r\nstood still. I feared that his reason, sapped by dissipation, had given\r\nway. I knew that for weeks, day in and day out, the niblick had hardly\r\never been out of his hand, and no constitution can stand that.\r\n\r\nHe looked up as he heard my footstep.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo,\" he said. \"Can you see a ball anywhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"A ball?\" I backed away, reaching for the door-handle. \"My dear boy,\" I\r\nsaid, soothingly, \"you have made a mistake. Quite a natural mistake.\r\nOne anybody would have made. But, as a matter of fact, this is the\r\nclub-house. The links are outside there. Why not come away with me very\r\nquietly and let us see if we can't find some balls on the links? If you\r\nwill wait here a moment, I will call up Doctor Smithson. He was telling\r\nme only this morning that he wanted a good spell of ball-hunting to put\r\nhim in shape. You don't mind if he joins us?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a Silver King with my initials on it,\" Mortimer went on, not\r\nheeding me. \"I got on the ninth green in eleven with a nice\r\nmashie-niblick, but my approach-putt was a little too strong. It came\r\nin through that window.\"\r\n\r\nI perceived for the first time that one of the windows facing the\r\ncourse was broken, and my relief was great. I went down on my knees and\r\nhelped him in his search. We ran the ball to earth finally inside the\r\npiano.\r\n\r\n\"What's the local rule?\" inquired Mortimer. \"Must I play it where it\r\nlies, or may I tee up and lose a stroke? If I have to play it where it\r\nlies, I suppose a niblick would be the club?\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Betty came in. One glance at her pale, set\r\nface told me that there was to be a scene, and I would have retired,\r\nbut that she was between me and the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, dear,\" said Mortimer, greeting her with a friendly waggle of\r\nhis niblick. \"I'm bunkered in the piano. My approach-putt was a little\r\nstrong, and I over-ran the green.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer,\" said the girl, tensely, \"I want to ask you one question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear? I wish, darling, you could have seen my drive at the eighth\r\njust now. It was a pip!\"\r\n\r\nBetty looked at him steadily.\r\n\r\n\"Are we engaged,\" she said, \"or are we not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Engaged? Oh, to be married? Why, of course. I tried the open stance\r\nfor a change, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"This morning you promised to take me for a ride. You never appeared.\r\nWhere were you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just playing golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Golf! I'm sick of the very name!\"\r\n\r\nA spasm shook Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't let people hear you saying things like that!\" he said. \"I\r\nsomehow felt, the moment I began my up-swing, that everything was going\r\nto be all right. I----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you one more chance. Will you take me for a drive in your\r\ncar this evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? What are you doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just playing golf!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm tired of being neglected like this!\" cried Betty, stamping her\r\nfoot. Poor girl, I saw her point of view. It was bad enough for her\r\nbeing engaged to the wrong man, without having him treat her as a mere\r\nacquaintance. Her conscience fighting with her love for Eddie Denton\r\nhad kept her true to Mortimer, and Mortimer accepted the sacrifice with\r\nan absent-minded carelessness which would have been galling to any\r\ngirl. \"We might just as well not be engaged at all. You never take me\r\nanywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked you to come with me to watch the Open Championship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you ever take me to dances?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could learn.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not sure if dancing is a good thing for a fellow's game. You\r\nnever hear of any first-class pro. dancing. James Braid doesn't dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my mind's made up. Mortimer, you must choose between golf and\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, darling, I went round in a hundred and one yesterday. You can't\r\nexpect a fellow to give up golf when he's at the top of his game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. I have nothing more to say. Our engagement is at an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't throw me over, Betty,\" pleaded Mortimer, and there was that in\r\nhis voice which cut me to the heart. \"You'll make me so miserable. And,\r\nwhen I'm miserable, I always slice my approach shots.\"\r\n\r\nBetty Weston drew herself up. Her face was hard.\r\n\r\n\"Here is your ring!\" she said, and swept from the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment after she had gone Mortimer remained very still, looking\r\nat the glistening circle in his hand. I stole across the room and\r\npatted his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Bear up, my boy, bear up!\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me piteously.\r\n\r\n\"Stymied!\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"Be brave!\"\r\n\r\nHe went on, speaking as if to himself.\r\n\r\n\"I had pictured--ah, how often I had pictured!--our little home! Hers\r\nand mine. She sewing in her arm-chair, I practising putts on the\r\nhearth-rug----\" He choked. \"While in the corner, little Harry Vardon\r\nSturgis played with little J. H. Taylor Sturgis. And round the\r\nroom--reading, busy with their childish tasks--little George Duncan\r\nSturgis, Abe Mitchell Sturgis, Harold Hilton Sturgis, Edward Ray\r\nSturgis, Horace Hutchinson Sturgis, and little James Braid Sturgis.\"\r\n\r\n\"My boy! My boy!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you giving yourself rather a large family?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head moodily.\r\n\r\n\"Was I?\" he said, dully. \"I don't know. What's bogey?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\n\"And yet----\" he said, at last, in a low voice. He paused. An odd,\r\nbright look had come into his eyes. He seemed suddenly to be himself\r\nagain, the old, happy Mortimer Sturgis I had known so well. \"And yet,\"\r\nhe said, \"who knows? Perhaps it is all for the best. They might all\r\nhave turned out tennis-players!\" He raised his niblick again, his face\r\naglow. \"Playing thirteen!\" he said. \"I think the game here would be to\r\nchip out through the door and work round the club-house to the green,\r\ndon't you?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLittle remains to be told. Betty and Eddie have been happily married\r\nfor years. Mortimer's handicap is now down to eighteen, and he is\r\nimproving all the time. He was not present at the wedding, being\r\nunavoidably detained by a medal tournament; but, if you turn up the\r\nfiles and look at the list of presents, which were both numerous and\r\ncostly, you will see--somewhere in the middle of the column, the words:\r\n\r\n  STURGIS, J. MORTIMER.\r\n    _Two dozen Silver King Golf-balls and one patent Sturgis\r\n         Aluminium Self-Adjusting, Self-Compensating Putting-Cleek._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n_Sundered Hearts_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the smoking-room of the club-house a cheerful fire was burning, and\r\nthe Oldest Member glanced from time to time out of the window into the\r\ngathering dusk. Snow was falling lightly on the links. From where he\r\nsat, the Oldest Member had a good view of the ninth green; and\r\npresently, out of the greyness of the December evening, there appeared\r\nover the brow of the hill a golf-ball. It trickled across the green,\r\nand stopped within a yard of the hole. The Oldest Member nodded\r\napprovingly. A good approach-shot.\r\n\r\nA young man in a tweed suit clambered on to the green, holed out with\r\neasy confidence, and, shouldering his bag, made his way to the\r\nclub-house. A few moments later he entered the smoking-room, and\r\nuttered an exclamation of rapture at the sight of the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I'm frozen stiff!\"\r\n\r\nHe rang for a waiter and ordered a hot drink. The Oldest Member gave a\r\ngracious assent to the suggestion that he should join him.\r\n\r\n\"I like playing in winter,\" said the young man. \"You get the course to\r\nyourself, for the world is full of slackers who only turn out when the\r\nweather suits them. I cannot understand where they get the nerve to\r\ncall themselves golfers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not everyone is as keen as you are, my boy,\" said the Sage, dipping\r\ngratefully into his hot drink. \"If they were, the world would be a\r\nbetter place, and we should hear less of all this modern unrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ pretty keen,\" admitted the young man.\r\n\r\n\"I have only encountered one man whom I could describe as keener. I\r\nallude to Mortimer Sturgis.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fellow who took up golf at thirty-eight and let the girl he was\r\nengaged to marry go off with someone else because he hadn't the time to\r\ncombine golf with courtship? I remember. You were telling me about him\r\nthe other day.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a sequel to that story, if you would care to hear it,\" said\r\nthe Oldest Member.\r\n\r\n\"You have the honour,\" said the young man. \"Go ahead!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome people (began the Oldest Member) considered that Mortimer Sturgis\r\nwas too wrapped up in golf, and blamed him for it. I could never see\r\neye to eye with them. In the days of King Arthur nobody thought the\r\nworse of a young knight if he suspended all his social and business\r\nengagements in favour of a search for the Holy Grail. In the Middle\r\nAges a man could devote his whole life to the Crusades, and the public\r\nfawned upon him. Why, then, blame the man of today for a zealous\r\nattention to the modern equivalent, the Quest of Scratch! Mortimer\r\nSturgis never became a scratch player, but he did eventually get his\r\nhandicap down to nine, and I honour him for it.\r\n\r\nThe story which I am about to tell begins in what might be called the\r\nmiddle period of Sturgis's career. He had reached the stage when his\r\nhandicap was a wobbly twelve; and, as you are no doubt aware, it is\r\nthen that a man really begins to golf in the true sense of the word.\r\nMortimer's fondness for the game until then had been merely tepid\r\ncompared with what it became now. He had played a little before, but\r\nnow he really buckled to and got down to it. It was at this point, too,\r\nthat he began once more to entertain thoughts of marriage. A profound\r\nstatistician in this one department, he had discovered that practically\r\nall the finest exponents of the art are married men; and the thought\r\nthat there might be something in the holy state which improved a man's\r\ngame, and that he was missing a good thing, troubled him a great deal.\r\nMoreover, the paternal instinct had awakened in him. As he justly\r\npointed out, whether marriage improved your game or not, it was to Old\r\nTom Morris's marriage that the existence of young Tommy Morris, winner\r\nof the British Open Championship four times in succession, could be\r\ndirectly traced. In fact, at the age of forty-two, Mortimer Sturgis was\r\nin just the frame of mind to take some nice girl aside and ask her to\r\nbecome a step-mother to his eleven drivers, his baffy, his twenty-eight\r\nputters, and the rest of the ninety-four clubs which he had accumulated\r\nin the course of his golfing career. The sole stipulation, of course,\r\nwhich he made when dreaming his daydreams was that the future Mrs.\r\nSturgis must be a golfer. I can still recall the horror in his face\r\nwhen one girl, admirable in other respects, said that she had never\r\nheard of Harry Vardon, and didn't he mean Dolly Vardon? She has since\r\nproved an excellent wife and mother, but Mortimer Sturgis never spoke\r\nto her again.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of January, it was Mortimer's practice to leave England\r\nand go to the South of France, where there was sunshine and crisp dry\r\nturf. He pursued his usual custom this year. With his suit-case and his\r\nninety-four clubs he went off to Saint Brule, staying as he always did\r\nat the Hotel Superbe, where they knew him, and treated with an amiable\r\ntolerance his habit of practising chip-shots in his bedroom. On the\r\nfirst evening, after breaking a statuette of the Infant Samuel in\r\nPrayer, he dressed and went down to dinner. And the first thing he saw\r\nwas Her.\r\n\r\nMortimer Sturgis, as you know, had been engaged before, but Betty\r\nWeston had never inspired the tumultuous rush of emotion which the mere\r\nsight of this girl had set loose in him. He told me later that just to\r\nwatch her holing out her soup gave him a sort of feeling you get when\r\nyour drive collides with a rock in the middle of a tangle of rough and\r\nkicks back into the middle of the fairway. If golf had come late in\r\nlife to Mortimer Sturgis, love came later still, and just as the golf,\r\nattacking him in middle life, had been some golf, so was the love\r\nconsiderable love. Mortimer finished his dinner in a trance, which is\r\nthe best way to do it at some hotels, and then scoured the place for\r\nsomeone who would introduce him. He found such a person eventually and\r\nthe meeting took place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe was a small and rather fragile-looking girl, with big blue eyes and\r\na cloud of golden hair. She had a sweet expression, and her left wrist\r\nwas in a sling. She looked up at Mortimer as if she had at last found\r\nsomething that amounted to something. I am inclined to think it was a\r\ncase of love at first sight on both sides.\r\n\r\n\"Fine weather we're having,\" said Mortimer, who was a capital\r\nconversationalist.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I like fine weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's something about fine weather!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's--it's--well, fine weather's so much finer than weather that isn't\r\nfine,\" said Mortimer.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the girl a little anxiously, fearing he might be taking\r\nher out of her depth, but she seemed to have followed his train of\r\nthought perfectly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, isn't it?\" she said. \"It's so--so fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I meant,\" said Mortimer. \"So fine. You've just hit\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHe was charmed. The combination of beauty with intelligence is so rare.\r\n\r\n\"I see you've hurt your wrist,\" he went on, pointing to the sling.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I strained it a little playing in the championship.\"\r\n\r\n\"The championship?\" Mortimer was interested. \"It's awfully rude of me,\"\r\nhe said, apologetically, \"but I didn't catch your name just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Somerset.\"\r\n\r\nMortimer had been bending forward solicitously. He overbalanced and\r\nnearly fell off his chair. The shock had been stunning. Even before he\r\nhad met and spoken to her, he had told himself that he loved this girl\r\nwith the stored-up love of a lifetime. And she was Mary Somerset! The\r\nhotel lobby danced before Mortimer's eyes.\r\n\r\nThe name will, of course, be familiar to you. In the early rounds of\r\nthe Ladies' Open Golf Championship of that year nobody had paid much\r\nattention to Mary Somerset. She had survived her first two matches, but\r\nher opponents had been nonentities like herself. And then, in the third\r\nround, she had met and defeated the champion. From that point on, her\r\nname was on everybody's lips. She became favourite. And she justified\r\nthe public confidence by sailing into the final and winning easily. And\r\nhere she was, talking to him like an ordinary person, and, if he could\r\nread the message in her eyes, not altogether indifferent to his charms,\r\nif you could call them that.\r\n\r\n\"Golly!\" said Mortimer, awed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir friendship ripened rapidly, as friendships do in the South of\r\nFrance. In that favoured clime, you find the girl and Nature does the\r\nrest. On the second morning of their acquaintance Mortimer invited her\r\nto walk round the links with him and watch him play. He did it a little\r\ndiffidently, for his golf was not of the calibre that would be likely\r\nto extort admiration from a champion. On the other hand, one should\r\nnever let slip the opportunity of acquiring wrinkles on the game, and\r\nhe thought that Miss Somerset, if she watched one or two of his shots,\r\nmight tell him just what he ought to do. And sure enough, the opening\r\narrived on the fourth hole, where Mortimer, after a drive which\r\nsurprised even himself, found his ball in a nasty cuppy lie.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the girl.\r\n\r\n\"What ought I to do here?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nMiss Somerset looked at the ball. She seemed to be weighing the matter\r\nin her mind.\r\n\r\n\"Give it a good hard knock,\" she said.\r\n\r\nMortimer knew what she meant. She was advocating a full iron. The only\r\ntrouble was that, when he tried anything more ambitious than a\r\nhalf-swing, except off the tee, he almost invariably topped. However,\r\nhe could not fail this wonderful girl, so he swung well back and took a\r\nchance. His enterprise was rewarded. The ball flew out of the\r\nindentation in the turf as cleanly as though John Henry Taylor had been\r\nbehind it, and rolled, looking neither to left nor to right, straight\r\nfor the pin. A few moments later Mortimer Sturgis had holed out one\r\nunder bogey, and it was only the fear that, having known him for so\r\nshort a time, she might be startled and refuse him that kept him from\r\nproposing then and there. This exhibition of golfing generalship on her\r\npart had removed his last doubts. He knew that, if he lived for ever,\r\nthere could be no other girl in the world for him. With her at his\r\nside, what might he not do? He might get his handicap down to six--to\r\nthree--to scratch--to plus something! Good heavens, why, even the\r\nAmateur Championship was not outside the range of possibility. Mortimer\r\nSturgis shook his putter solemnly in the air, and vowed a silent vow\r\nthat he would win this pearl among women.\r\n\r\nNow, when a man feels like that, it is impossible to restrain him long.\r\nFor a week Mortimer Sturgis's soul sizzled within him: then he could\r\ncontain himself no longer. One night, at one of the informal dances at\r\nthe hotel, he drew the girl out on to the moonlit terrace.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Somerset----\" he began, stuttering with emotion like an\r\nimperfectly-corked bottle of ginger-beer. \"Miss Somerset--may I call\r\nyou Mary?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him with eyes that shone softly in the dim light.\r\n\r\n\"Mary?\" she repeated. \"Why, of course, if you like----\"\r\n\r\n\"If I like!\" cried Mortimer. \"Don't you know that it is my dearest\r\nwish? Don't you know that I would rather be permitted to call you Mary\r\nthan do the first hole at Muirfield in two? Oh, Mary, how I have longed\r\nfor this moment! I love you! I love you! Ever since I met you I have\r\nknown that you were the one girl in this vast world whom I would die to\r\nwin! Mary, will you be mine? Shall we go round together? Will you fix\r\nup a match with me on the links of life which shall end only when the\r\nGrim Reaper lays us both a stymie?\"\r\n\r\nShe drooped towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer!\" she murmured.\r\n\r\nHe held out his arms, then drew back. His face had grown suddenly\r\ntense, and there were lines of pain about his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he said, in a strained voice. \"Mary, I love you dearly, and\r\nbecause I love you so dearly I cannot let you trust your sweet life to\r\nme blindly. I have a confession to make, I am not--I have not always\r\nbeen\"--he paused--\"a good man,\" he said, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nShe started indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"How can you say that? You are the best, the kindest, the bravest man I\r\nhave ever met! Who but a good man would have risked his life to save me\r\nfrom drowning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drowning?\" Mortimer's voice seemed perplexed. \"You? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you forgotten the time when I fell in the sea last week, and you\r\njumped in with all your clothes on----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, yes,\" said Mortimer. \"I remember now. It was the day I did\r\nthe long seventh in five. I got off a good tee-shot straight down the\r\nfairway, took a baffy for my second, and---- But that is not the point.\r\nIt is sweet and generous of you to think so highly of what was the\r\nmerest commonplace act of ordinary politeness, but I must repeat, that\r\njudged by the standards of your snowy purity, I am not a good man. I do\r\nnot come to you clean and spotless as a young girl should expect her\r\nhusband to come to her. Once, playing in a foursome, my ball fell in\r\nsome long grass. Nobody was near me. We had no caddies, and the others\r\nwere on the fairway. God knows----\" His voice shook. \"God knows I\r\nstruggled against the temptation. But I fell. I kicked the ball on to a\r\nlittle bare mound, from which it was an easy task with a nice\r\nhalf-mashie to reach the green for a snappy seven. Mary, there have\r\nbeen times when, going round by myself, I have allowed myself ten-foot\r\nputts on three holes in succession, simply in order to be able to say I\r\nhad done the course in under a hundred. Ah! you shrink from me! You are\r\ndisgusted!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not disgusted! And I don't shrink! I only shivered because it is\r\nrather cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you can love me in spite of my past?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer!\"\r\n\r\nShe fell into his arms.\r\n\r\n\"My dearest,\" he said presently, \"what a happy life ours will be. That\r\nis, if you do not find that you have made a mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"A mistake!\" she cried, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my handicap is twelve, you know, and not so darned twelve at\r\nthat. There are days when I play my second from the fairway of the next\r\nhole but one, days when I couldn't putt into a coal-hole with\r\n'Welcome!' written over it. And you are a Ladies' Open Champion. Still,\r\nif you think it's all right----. Oh, Mary, you little know how I have\r\ndreamed of some day marrying a really first-class golfer! Yes, that was\r\nmy vision--of walking up the aisle with some sweet plus two girl on my\r\narm. You shivered again. You are catching cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a little cold,\" said the girl. She spoke in a small voice.\r\n\r\n\"Let me take you in, sweetheart,\" said Mortimer. \"I'll just put you in\r\na comfortable chair with a nice cup of coffee, and then I think I\r\nreally must come out again and tramp about and think how perfectly\r\nsplendid everything is.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were married a few weeks later, very quietly, in the little\r\nvillage church of Saint Brule. The secretary of the local golf-club\r\nacted as best man for Mortimer, and a girl from the hotel was the only\r\nbridesmaid. The whole business was rather a disappointment to Mortimer,\r\nwho had planned out a somewhat florid ceremony at St. George's, Hanover\r\nSquare, with the Vicar of Tooting (a scratch player excellent at short\r\napproach shots) officiating, and \"The Voice That Breathed O'er St.\r\nAndrews\" boomed from the organ. He had even had the idea of copying the\r\nmilitary wedding and escorting his bride out of the church under an\r\narch of crossed cleeks. But she would have none of this pomp. She\r\ninsisted on a quiet wedding, and for the honeymoon trip preferred a\r\ntour through Italy. Mortimer, who had wanted to go to Scotland to visit\r\nthe birthplace of James Braid, yielded amiably, for he loved her\r\ndearly. But he did not think much of Italy. In Rome, the great\r\nmonuments of the past left him cold. Of the Temple of Vespasian, all he\r\nthought was that it would be a devil of a place to be bunkered behind.\r\nThe Colosseum aroused a faint spark of interest in him, as he\r\nspeculated whether Abe Mitchell would use a full brassey to carry it.\r\nIn Florence, the view over the Tuscan Hills from the Torre Rosa,\r\nFiesole, over which his bride waxed enthusiastic, seemed to him merely\r\na nasty bit of rough which would take a deal of getting out of.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in the fullness of time, they came home to Mortimer's cosy\r\nlittle house adjoining the links.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMortimer was so busy polishing his ninety-four clubs on the evening of\r\ntheir arrival that he failed to notice that his wife was preoccupied. A\r\nless busy man would have perceived at a glance that she was distinctly\r\nnervous. She started at sudden noises, and once, when he tried the\r\nnewest of his mashie-niblicks and broke one of the drawing-room\r\nwindows, she screamed sharply. In short her manner was strange, and, if\r\nEdgar Allen Poe had put her into \"The Fall Of the House of Usher\", she\r\nwould have fitted it like the paper on the wall. She had the air of one\r\nwaiting tensely for the approach of some imminent doom. Mortimer,\r\nhumming gaily to himself as he sand-papered the blade of his\r\ntwenty-second putter, observed none of this. He was thinking of the\r\nmorrow's play.\r\n\r\n\"Your wrist's quite well again now, darling, isn't it?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Yes, quite well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" said Mortimer. \"We'll breakfast early--say at half-past\r\nseven--and then we'll be able to get in a couple of rounds before\r\nlunch. A couple more in the afternoon will about see us through. One\r\ndoesn't want to over-golf oneself the first day.\" He swung the putter\r\njoyfully. \"How had we better play do you think? We might start with you\r\ngiving me a half.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not speak. She was very pale. She clutched the arm of her chair\r\ntightly till the knuckles showed white under the skin.\r\n\r\nTo anybody but Mortimer her nervousness would have been even more\r\nobvious on the following morning, as they reached the first tee. Her\r\neyes were dull and heavy, and she started when a grasshopper chirruped.\r\nBut Mortimer was too occupied with thinking how jolly it was having the\r\ncourse to themselves to notice anything.\r\n\r\nHe scooped some sand out of the box, and took a ball out of her bag.\r\nHis wedding present to her had been a brand-new golf-bag, six dozen\r\nballs, and a full set of the most expensive clubs, all born in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like a high tee?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" she replied, coming with a start out of her thoughts.\r\n\"Doctors say it's indigestible.\"\r\n\r\nMortimer laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n\"Deuced good!\" he chuckled. \"Is that your own or did you read it in a\r\ncomic paper? There you are!\" He placed the ball on a little hill of\r\nsand, and got up. \"Now let's see some of that championship form of\r\nyours!\"\r\n\r\nShe burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"My darling!\"\r\n\r\nMortimer ran to her and put his arms round her. She tried weakly to\r\npush him away.\r\n\r\n\"My angel! What is it?\"\r\n\r\nShe sobbed brokenly. Then, with an effort, she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer, I have deceived you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Deceived me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never played golf in my life! I don't even know how to hold the\r\ncaddie!\"\r\n\r\nMortimer's heart stood still. This sounded like the gibberings of an\r\nunbalanced mind, and no man likes his wife to begin gibbering\r\nimmediately after the honeymoon.\r\n\r\n\"My precious! You are not yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am! That's the whole trouble! I'm myself and not the girl you\r\nthought I was!\"\r\n\r\nMortimer stared at her, puzzled. He was thinking that it was a little\r\ndifficult and that, to work it out properly, he would need a pencil and\r\na bit of paper.\r\n\r\n\"My name is not Mary!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you said it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't. You asked if you could call me Mary, and I said you might,\r\nbecause I loved you too much to deny your smallest whim. I was going on\r\nto say that it wasn't my name, but you interrupted me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Mary!\" The horrid truth was coming home to Mortimer. \"You were not\r\nMary Somerset?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary is my cousin. My name is Mabel.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you said you had sprained your wrist playing in the championship.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I had. The mallet slipped in my hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mallet!\" Mortimer clutched at his forehead. \"You didn't say 'the\r\nmallet'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mortimer! The mallet!\"\r\n\r\nA faint blush of shame mantled her cheek, and into her blue eyes there\r\ncame a look of pain, but she faced him bravely.\r\n\r\n\"I am the Ladies' Open Croquet Champion!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nMortimer Sturgis cried aloud, a cry that was like the shriek of some\r\nwounded animal.\r\n\r\n\"Croquet!\" He gulped, and stared at her with unseeing eyes. He was no\r\nprude, but he had those decent prejudices of which no self-respecting\r\nman can wholly rid himself, however broad-minded he may try to be.\r\n\"Croquet!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. The light breeze sang in the pines above\r\nthem. The grasshoppers chirrupped at their feet.\r\n\r\nShe began to speak again in a low, monotonous voice.\r\n\r\n\"I blame myself! I should have told you before, while there was yet\r\ntime for you to withdraw. I should have confessed this to you that\r\nnight on the terrace in the moonlight. But you swept me off my feet,\r\nand I was in your arms before I realized what you would think of me. It\r\nwas only then that I understood what my supposed skill at golf meant to\r\nyou, and then it was too late. I loved you too much to let you go! I\r\ncould not bear the thought of you recoiling from me. Oh, I was\r\nmad--mad! I knew that I could not keep up the deception for ever, that\r\nyou must find me out in time. But I had a wild hope that by then we\r\nshould be so close to one another that you might find it in your heart\r\nto forgive. But I was wrong. I see it now. There are some things that\r\nno man can forgive. Some things,\" she repeated, dully, \"which no man\r\ncan forgive.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned away. Mortimer awoke from his trance.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" he cried. \"Don't go!\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to talk this over.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head sadly and started to walk slowly across the sunlit\r\ngrass. Mortimer watched her, his brain in a whirl of chaotic thoughts.\r\nShe disappeared through the trees.\r\n\r\nMortimer sat down on the tee-box, and buried his face in his hands. For\r\na time he could think of nothing but the cruel blow he had received.\r\nThis was the end of those rainbow visions of himself and her going\r\nthrough life side by side, she lovingly criticizing his stance and his\r\nback-swing, he learning wisdom from her. A croquet-player! He was\r\nmarried to a woman who hit coloured balls through hoops. Mortimer\r\nSturgis writhed in torment. A strong man's agony.\r\n\r\nThe mood passed. How long it had lasted, he did not know. But suddenly,\r\nas he sat there, he became once more aware of the glow of the sunshine\r\nand the singing of the birds. It was as if a shadow had lifted. Hope\r\nand optimism crept into his heart.\r\n\r\nHe loved her. He loved her still. She was part of him, and nothing that\r\nshe could do had power to alter that. She had deceived him, yes. But\r\nwhy had she deceived him? Because she loved him so much that she could\r\nnot bear to lose him. Dash it all, it was a bit of a compliment.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, poor girl, was it her fault? Was it not rather the\r\nfault of her upbringing? Probably she had been taught to play croquet\r\nwhen a mere child, hardly able to distinguish right from wrong. No\r\nsteps had been taken to eradicate the virus from her system, and the\r\nthing had become chronic. Could she be blamed? Was she not more to be\r\npitied than censured?\r\n\r\nMortimer rose to his feet, his heart swelling with generous\r\nforgiveness. The black horror had passed from him. The future seemed\r\nonce more bright. It was not too late. She was still young, many years\r\nyounger than he himself had been when he took up golf, and surely, if\r\nshe put herself into the hands of a good specialist and practised every\r\nday, she might still hope to become a fair player. He reached the house\r\nand ran in, calling her name.\r\n\r\nNo answer came. He sped from room to room, but all were empty.\r\n\r\nShe had gone. The house was there. The furniture was there. The canary\r\nsang in its cage, the cook in the kitchen. The pictures still hung on\r\nthe walls. But she had gone. Everything was at home except his wife.\r\n\r\nFinally, propped up against the cup he had once won in a handicap\r\ncompetition, he saw a letter. With a sinking heart he tore open the\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\nIt was a pathetic, a tragic letter, the letter of a woman endeavouring\r\nto express all the anguish of a torn heart with one of those\r\nfountain-pens which suspend the flow of ink about twice in every three\r\nwords. The gist of it was that she felt she had wronged him; that,\r\nthough he might forgive, he could never forget; and that she was going\r\naway, away out into the world alone.\r\n\r\nMortimer sank into a chair, and stared blankly before him. She had\r\nscratched the match.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am not a married man myself, so have had no experience of how it\r\nfeels to have one's wife whizz off silently into the unknown; but I\r\nshould imagine that it must be something like taking a full swing with\r\na brassey and missing the ball. Something, I take it, of the same sense\r\nof mingled shock, chagrin, and the feeling that nobody loves one, which\r\nattacks a man in such circumstances, must come to the bereaved husband.\r\nAnd one can readily understand how terribly the incident must have\r\nshaken Mortimer Sturgis. I was away at the time, but I am told by those\r\nwho saw him that his game went all to pieces.\r\n\r\nHe had never shown much indication of becoming anything in the nature\r\nof a first-class golfer, but he had managed to acquire one or two\r\ndecent shots. His work with the light iron was not at all bad, and he\r\nwas a fairly steady putter. But now, under the shadow of this tragedy,\r\nhe dropped right back to the form of his earliest period. It was a\r\npitiful sight to see this gaunt, haggard man with the look of dumb\r\nanguish behind his spectacles taking as many as three shots sometimes\r\nto get past the ladies' tee. His slice, of which he had almost cured\r\nhimself, returned with such virulence that in the list of ordinary\r\nhazards he had now to include the tee-box. And, when he was not\r\nslicing, he was pulling. I have heard that he was known, when driving\r\nat the sixth, to get bunkered in his own caddie, who had taken up his\r\nposition directly behind him. As for the deep sand-trap in front of the\r\nseventh green, he spent so much of his time in it that there was some\r\ninformal talk among the members of the committee of charging him a\r\nsmall weekly rent.\r\n\r\nA man of comfortable independent means, he lived during these days on\r\nnext to nothing. Golf-balls cost him a certain amount, but the bulk of\r\nhis income he spent in efforts to discover his wife's whereabouts. He\r\nadvertised in all the papers. He employed private detectives. He even,\r\nmuch as it revolted his finer instincts, took to travelling about the\r\ncountry, watching croquet matches. But she was never among the players.\r\nI am not sure that he did not find a melancholy comfort in this, for it\r\nseemed to show that, whatever his wife might be and whatever she might\r\nbe doing, she had not gone right under.\r\n\r\nSummer passed. Autumn came and went. Winter arrived. The days grew\r\nbleak and chill, and an early fall of snow, heavier than had been known\r\nat that time of the year for a long while, put an end to golf. Mortimer\r\nspent his days indoors, staring gloomily through the window at the\r\nwhite mantle that covered the earth.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young man shifted uneasily on his seat. His face was long and\r\nsombre.\r\n\r\n\"All this is very depressing,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"These soul tragedies,\" agreed the Oldest Member, \"are never very\r\ncheery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said the young man, firmly, \"tell me one thing frankly, as\r\nman to man. Did Mortimer find her dead in the snow, covered except for\r\nher face, on which still lingered that faint, sweet smile which he\r\nremembered so well? Because, if he did, I'm going home.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" protested the Oldest Member. \"Nothing of that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure? You aren't going to spring it on me suddenly?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\"\r\n\r\nThe young man breathed a relieved sigh.\r\n\r\n\"It was your saying that about the white mantle covering the earth that\r\nmade me suspicious.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sage resumed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve. All day the snow had been falling, and now it lay\r\nthick and deep over the countryside. Mortimer Sturgis, his frugal\r\ndinner concluded--what with losing his wife and not being able to get\r\nany golf, he had little appetite these days--was sitting in his\r\ndrawing-room, moodily polishing the blade of his jigger. Soon wearying\r\nof this once congenial task, he laid down the club and went to the\r\nfront door to see if there was any chance of a thaw. But no. It was\r\nfreezing. The snow, as he tested it with his shoe, crackled crisply.\r\nThe sky above was black and full of cold stars. It seemed to Mortimer\r\nthat the sooner he packed up and went to the South of France, the\r\nbetter. He was just about to close the door, when suddenly he thought\r\nhe heard his own name called.\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer!\"\r\n\r\nHad he been mistaken? The voice had sounded faint and far away.\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer!\"\r\n\r\nHe thrilled from head to foot. This time there could be no mistake. It\r\nwas the voice he knew so well, his wife's voice, and it had come from\r\nsomewhere down near the garden-gate. It is difficult to judge distance\r\nwhere sounds are concerned, but Mortimer estimated that the voice had\r\nspoken about a short mashie-niblick and an easy putt from where he\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he was racing down the snow-covered path. And then his\r\nheart stood still. What was that dark something on the ground just\r\ninside the gate? He leaped towards it. He passed his hands over it. It\r\nwas a human body. Quivering, he struck a match. It went out. He struck\r\nanother. That went out, too. He struck a third, and it burnt with a\r\nsteady flame; and, stooping, he saw that it was his wife who lay there,\r\ncold and stiff. Her eyes were closed, and on her face still lingered\r\nthat faint, sweet smile which he remembered so well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young man rose with a set face. He reached for his golf-bag.\r\n\r\n\"I call that a dirty trick,\" he said, \"after you promised--\" The Sage\r\nwaved him back to his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Have no fear! She had only fainted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said she was cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you be cold if you were lying in the snow?\"\r\n\r\n\"And stiff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Sturgis was stiff because the train-service was bad, it being the\r\nholiday-season, and she had had to walk all the way from the junction,\r\na distance of eight miles. Sit down and allow me to proceed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTenderly, reverently Mortimer Sturgis picked her up and began to bear\r\nher into the house. Half-way there, his foot slipped on a piece of ice\r\nand he fell heavily, barking his shin and shooting his lovely burden\r\nout on to the snow.\r\n\r\nThe fall brought her to. She opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer, darling!\" she said.\r\n\r\nMortimer had just been going to say something else, but he checked\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Are you alive?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" said Mortimer, scooping some of the snow out of the back\r\nof his collar.\r\n\r\nTogether they went into the house, and into the drawing-room. Wife\r\ngazed at husband, husband at wife. There was a silence.\r\n\r\n\"Rotten weather!\" said Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, isn't it!\"\r\n\r\nThe spell was broken. They fell into each other's arms. And presently\r\nthey were sitting side by side on the sofa, holding hands, just as if\r\nthat awful parting had been but a dream.\r\n\r\nIt was Mortimer who made the first reference to it.\r\n\r\n\"I say, you know,\" he said, \"you oughtn't to have nipped away like\r\nthat!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you hated me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hated _you_! I love you better than life itself! I would sooner\r\nhave smashed my pet driver than have had you leave me!\"\r\n\r\nShe thrilled at the words.\r\n\r\n\"Darling!\"\r\n\r\nMortimer fondled her hand.\r\n\r\n\"I was just coming back to tell you that I loved you still. I was going\r\nto suggest that you took lessons from some good professional. And I\r\nfound you gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't worthy of you, Mortimer!\"\r\n\r\n\"My angel!\" He pressed his lips to her hair, and spoke solemnly. \"All\r\nthis has taught me a lesson, dearest. I knew all along, and I know it\r\nmore than ever now, that it is you--you that I want. Just you! I don't\r\ncare if you don't play golf. I don't care----\" He hesitated, then went on\r\nmanfully. \"I don't care even if you play croquet, so long as you are\r\nwith me!\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment her face showed rapture that made it almost angelic. She\r\nuttered a low moan of ecstasy. She kissed him. Then she rose.\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer, look!\"\r\n\r\n\"What at?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me. Just look!\"\r\n\r\nThe jigger which he had been polishing lay on a chair close by. She\r\ntook it up. From the bowl of golf-balls on the mantelpiece she selected\r\na brand new one. She placed it on the carpet. She addressed it. Then,\r\nwith a merry cry of \"Fore!\" she drove it hard and straight through the\r\nglass of the china-cupboard.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" cried Mortimer, astounded. It had been a bird of a shot.\r\n\r\nShe turned to him, her whole face alight with that beautiful smile.\r\n\r\n\"When I left you, Mortie,\" she said, \"I had but one aim in life,\r\nsomehow to make myself worthy of you. I saw your advertisements in the\r\npapers, and I longed to answer them, but I was not ready. All this\r\nlong, weary while I have been in the village of Auchtermuchtie, in\r\nScotland, studying under Tamms McMickle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the Tamms McMickle who finished fourth in the Open Championship of\r\n1911, and had the best ball in the foursome in 1912 with Jock McHaggis,\r\nAndy McHeather, and Sandy McHoots!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mortimer, the very same. Oh, it was difficult at first. I missed\r\nmy mallet, and long to steady the ball with my foot and use the toe of\r\nthe club. Wherever there was a direction post I aimed at it\r\nautomatically. But I conquered my weakness. I practised steadily. And\r\nnow Mr. McMickle says my handicap would be a good twenty-four on any\r\nlinks.\" She smiled apologetically. \"Of course, that doesn't sound much\r\nto you! You were a twelve when I left you, and now I suppose you are\r\ndown to eight or something.\"\r\n\r\nMortimer shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, no!\" he replied, gravely. \"My game went right off for some\r\nreason or other, and I'm twenty-four, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"For some reason or other!\" She uttered a cry. \"Oh, I know what the\r\nreason was! How can I ever forgive myself! I have ruined your game!\"\r\n\r\nThe brightness came back to Mortimer's eyes. He embraced her fondly.\r\n\r\n\"Do not reproach yourself, dearest,\" he murmured. \"It is the best thing\r\nthat could have happened. From now on, we start level, two hearts that\r\nbeat as one, two drivers that drive as one. I could not wish it\r\notherwise. By George! It's just like that thing of Tennyson's.\"\r\n\r\nHe recited the lines softly:\r\n\r\n                 _My bride,\r\n    My wife, my life. Oh, we will walk the links\r\n    Yoked in all exercise of noble end,\r\n    And so thro' those dark bunkers off the course\r\n    That no man knows. Indeed, I love thee: come,\r\n    Yield thyself up: our handicaps are one;\r\n    Accomplish thou my manhood and thyself;\r\n    Lay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me._\r\n\r\nShe laid her hands in his.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Mortie, darling,\" she said, \"I want to tell you all about how\r\nI did the long twelfth at Auchtermuchtie in one under bogey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n_The Salvation of George Mackintosh_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young man came into the club-house. There was a frown on his\r\nusually cheerful face, and he ordered a ginger-ale in the sort of voice\r\nwhich an ancient Greek would have used when asking the executioner to\r\nbring on the hemlock.\r\n\r\nSunk in the recesses of his favourite settee the Oldest Member had\r\nwatched him with silent sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"How did you get on?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"He beat me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member nodded his venerable head.\r\n\r\n\"You have had a trying time, if I am not mistaken. I feared as much\r\nwhen I saw you go out with Pobsley. How many a young man have I seen go\r\nout with Herbert Pobsley exulting in his youth, and crawl back at\r\neventide looking like a toad under the harrow! He talked?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the time, confound it! Put me right off my stroke.\"\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member sighed.\r\n\r\n\"The talking golfer is undeniably the most pronounced pest of our\r\ncomplex modern civilization,\" he said, \"and the most difficult to deal\r\nwith. It is a melancholy thought that the noblest of games should have\r\nproduced such a scourge. I have frequently marked Herbert Pobsley in\r\naction. As the crackling of thorns under a pot.... He is almost as bad\r\nas poor George Mackintosh in his worst period. Did I ever tell you\r\nabout George Mackintosh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"His,\" said the Sage, \"is the only case of golfing garrulity I have\r\never known where a permanent cure was affected. If you would care to\r\nhear about it----?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge Mackintosh (said the Oldest Member), when I first knew him, was\r\none of the most admirable young fellows I have ever met. A handsome,\r\nwell-set-up man, with no vices except a tendency to use the mashie for\r\nshots which should have been made with the light iron. And as for his\r\npositive virtues, they were too numerous to mention. He never swayed\r\nhis body, moved his head, or pressed. He was always ready to utter a\r\ntactful grunt when his opponent foozled. And when he himself achieved a\r\nglaring fluke, his self-reproachful click of the tongue was music to\r\nhis adversary's bruised soul. But of all his virtues the one that most\r\nendeared him to me and to all thinking men was the fact that, from the\r\nstart of a round to the finish, he never spoke a word except when\r\nabsolutely compelled to do so by the exigencies of the game. And it was\r\nthis man who subsequently, for a black period which lives in the memory\r\nof all his contemporaries, was known as Gabby George and became a shade\r\nless popular than the germ of Spanish Influenza. Truly, _corruptio\r\noptimi pessima!_\r\n\r\nOne of the things that sadden a man as he grows older and reviews his\r\nlife is the reflection that his most devastating deeds were generally\r\nthe ones which he did with the best motives. The thought is\r\ndisheartening. I can honestly say that, when George Mackintosh came to\r\nme and told me his troubles, my sole desire was to ameliorate his lot.\r\nThat I might be starting on the downward path a man whom I liked and\r\nrespected never once occurred to me.\r\n\r\nOne night after dinner when George Mackintosh came in, I could see at\r\nonce that there was something on his mind, but what this could be I was\r\nat a loss to imagine, for I had been playing with him myself all the\r\nafternoon, and he had done an eighty-one and a seventy-nine. And, as I\r\nhad not left the links till dusk was beginning to fall, it was\r\npractically impossible that he could have gone out again and done\r\nbadly. The idea of financial trouble seemed equally out of the\r\nquestion. George had a good job with the old-established legal firm of\r\nPeabody, Peabody, Peabody, Peabody, Cootes, Toots, and Peabody. The\r\nthird alternative, that he might be in love, I rejected at once. In all\r\nthe time I had known him I had never seen a sign that George Mackintosh\r\ngave a thought to the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nYet this, bizarre as it seemed, was the true solution. Scarcely had he\r\nseated himself and lit a cigar when he blurted out his confession.\r\n\r\n\"What would you do in a case like this?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Like what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well----\" He choked, and a rich blush permeated his surface. \"Well, it\r\nseems a silly thing to say and all that, but I'm in love with Miss\r\nTennant, you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are in love with Celia Tennant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am. I've got eyes, haven't I? Who else is there that any\r\nsane man could possibly be in love with? That,\" he went on, moodily,\r\n\"is the whole trouble. There's a field of about twenty-nine, and I\r\nshould think my place in the betting is about thirty-three to one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot agree with you there,\" I said. \"You have every advantage, it\r\nappears to me. You are young, amiable, good-looking, comfortably off,\r\nscratch----\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't talk, confound it!\" he burst out. \"And how is a man to get\r\nanywhere at this sort of game without talking?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are talking perfectly fluently now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to you. But put me in front of Celia Tennant, and I simply make a\r\nsort of gurgling noise like a sheep with the botts. It kills my chances\r\nstone dead. You know these other men. I can give Claude Mainwaring a\r\nthird and beat him. I can give Eustace Brinkley a stroke a hole and\r\nsimply trample on his corpse. But when it comes to talking to a girl,\r\nI'm not in their class.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not be diffident.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I _am_ diffident. What's the good of saying I mustn't be\r\ndiffident when I'm the man who wrote the words and music, when\r\nDiffidence is my middle name and my telegraphic address? I can't help\r\nbeing diffident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you could overcome it?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how? It was in the hope that you might be able to suggest\r\nsomething that I came round tonight.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was where I did the fatal thing. It happened that, just before\r\nI took up \"Braid on the Push-Shot,\" I had been dipping into the current\r\nnumber of a magazine, and one of the advertisements, I chanced to\r\nremember, might have been framed with a special eye to George's\r\nunfortunate case. It was that one, which I have no doubt you have seen,\r\nwhich treats of \"How to Become a Convincing Talker\". I picked up this\r\nmagazine now and handed it to George.\r\n\r\nHe studied it for a few minutes in thoughtful silence. He looked at the\r\npicture of the Man who had taken the course being fawned upon by lovely\r\nwomen, while the man who had let this opportunity slip stood outside\r\nthe group gazing with a wistful envy.\r\n\r\n\"They never do that to me,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"Do what, my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cluster round, clinging cooingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I gather from the letterpress that they will if you write for the\r\nbooklet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think there is really something in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason why eloquence should not be taught by mail. One seems\r\nto be able to acquire every other desirable quality in that manner\r\nnowadays.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might try it. After all, it's not expensive. There's no doubt about\r\nit,\" he murmured, returning to his perusal, \"that fellow does look\r\npopular. Of course, the evening dress may have something to do with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The other man, you will notice, is also wearing evening\r\ndress, and yet he is merely among those on the outskirts. It is simply\r\na question of writing for the booklet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent post free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent, as you say, post free.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a good mind to try it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason why you should not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, by Duncan!\" He tore the page out of the magazine and put it in\r\nhis pocket. \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give this thing a trial\r\nfor a week or two, and at the end of that time I'll go to the boss and\r\nsee how he reacts when I ask for a rise of salary. If he crawls, it'll\r\nshow there's something in this. If he flings me out, it will prove the\r\nthing's no good.\"\r\n\r\nWe left it at that, and I am bound to say--owing, no doubt, to my not\r\nhaving written for the booklet of the Memory Training Course advertised\r\non the adjoining page of the magazine--the matter slipped from my mind.\r\nWhen, therefore, a few weeks later, I received a telegram from young\r\nMackintosh which ran:\r\n\r\n    _Worked like magic,_\r\n\r\nI confess I was intensely puzzled. It was only a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore George himself arrived that I solved the problem of its meaning.\r\n\r\n\"So the boss crawled?\" I said, as he came in.\r\n\r\nHe gave a light, confident laugh. I had not seen him, as I say, for\r\nsome time, and I was struck by the alteration in his appearance. In\r\nwhat exactly this alteration consisted I could not at first have said;\r\nbut gradually it began to impress itself on me that his eye was\r\nbrighter, his jaw squarer, his carriage a trifle more upright than it\r\nhad been. But it was his eye that struck me most forcibly. The George\r\nMackintosh I had known had had a pleasing gaze, but, though frank and\r\nagreeable, it had never been more dynamic than a fried egg. This new\r\nGeorge had an eye that was a combination of a gimlet and a searchlight.\r\nColeridge's Ancient Mariner, I imagine, must have been somewhat\r\nsimilarly equipped. The Ancient Mariner stopped a wedding guest on his\r\nway to a wedding; George Mackintosh gave me the impression that he\r\ncould have stopped the Cornish Riviera express on its way to Penzance.\r\nSelf-confidence--aye, and more than self-confidence--a sort of sinful,\r\noverbearing swank seemed to exude from his very pores.\r\n\r\n\"Crawled?\" he said. \"Well, he didn't actually lick my boots, because I\r\nsaw him coming and side-stepped; but he did everything short of that. I\r\nhadn't been talking an hour when----\"\r\n\r\n\"An hour!\" I gasped. \"Did you talk for an hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. You wouldn't have had me be abrupt, would you? I went into\r\nhis private office and found him alone. I think at first he would have\r\nbeen just as well pleased if I had retired. In fact, he said as much.\r\nBut I soon adjusted that outlook. I took a seat and a cigarette, and\r\nthen I started to sketch out for him the history of my connection with\r\nthe firm. He began to wilt before the end of the first ten minutes. At\r\nthe quarter of an hour mark he was looking at me like a lost dog that's\r\njust found its owner. By the half-hour he was making little bleating\r\nnoises and massaging my coat-sleeve. And when, after perhaps an hour\r\nand a half, I came to my peroration and suggested a rise, he choked\r\nback a sob, gave me double what I had asked, and invited me to dine at\r\nhis club next Tuesday. I'm a little sorry now I cut the thing so short.\r\nA few minutes more, and I fancy he would have given me his\r\nsock-suspenders and made over his life-insurance in my favour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, as soon as I could speak, for I was finding my young\r\nfriend a trifle overpowering, \"this is most satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\"So-so,\" said George. \"Not un-so-so. A man wants an addition to his\r\nincome when he is going to get married.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" I said. \"That, of course, will be the real test.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, when you propose to Celia Tennant. You remember you were saying\r\nwhen we spoke of this before--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that!\" said George, carelessly. \"I've arranged all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. On my way up from the station. I looked in on Celia about an\r\nhour ago, and it's all settled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amazing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know. I just put the thing to her, and she seemed to see\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you. So now, like Alexander, you have no more worlds to\r\nconquer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know so much about that,\" said George. \"The way it looks to\r\nme is that I'm just starting. This eloquence is a thing that rather grows\r\non one. You didn't hear about my after-dinner speech at the anniversary\r\nbanquet of the firm, I suppose? My dear fellow, a riot! A positive\r\nstampede. Had 'em laughing and then crying and then laughing again and\r\nthen crying once more till six of 'em had to be led out and the rest down\r\nwith hiccoughs. Napkins waving ... three tables broken ... waiters in\r\nhysterics. I tell you, I played on them as on a stringed instrument....\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you play on a stringed instrument?\"\r\n\r\n\"As it happens, no. But as I would have played on a stringed instrument\r\nif I could play on a stringed instrument. Wonderful sense of power it\r\ngives you. I mean to go in pretty largely for that sort of thing in\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not let it interfere with your golf.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a laugh which turned my blood cold.\r\n\r\n\"Golf!\" he said. \"After all, what is golf? Just pushing a small ball\r\ninto a hole. A child could do it. Indeed, children have done it with\r\ngreat success. I see an infant of fourteen has just won some sort of\r\nchampionship. Could that stripling convulse a roomful of banqueters? I\r\nthink not! To sway your fellow-men with a word, to hold them with a\r\ngesture ... that is the real salt of life. I don't suppose I shall play\r\nmuch more golf now. I'm making arrangements for a lecturing-tour, and\r\nI'm booked up for fifteen lunches already.\"\r\n\r\nThose were his words. A man who had once done the lake-hole in one. A\r\nman whom the committee were grooming for the amateur championship. I am\r\nno weakling, but I confess they sent a chill shiver down my spine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge Mackintosh did not, I am glad to say, carry out his mad project\r\nto the letter. He did not altogether sever himself from golf. He was\r\nstill to be seen occasionally on the links. But now--and I know of\r\nnothing more tragic that can befall a man--he found himself gradually\r\nshunned, he who in the days of his sanity had been besieged with more\r\noffers of games than he could manage to accept. Men simply would not\r\nstand his incessant flow of talk. One by one they dropped off, until\r\nthe only person he could find to go round with him was old Major\r\nMoseby, whose hearing completely petered out as long ago as the year\r\n'98. And, of course, Celia Tennant would play with him occasionally;\r\nbut it seemed to me that even she, greatly as no doubt she loved him,\r\nwas beginning to crack under the strain.\r\n\r\nSo surely had I read the pallor of her face and the wild look of dumb\r\nagony in her eyes that I was not surprised when, as I sat one morning\r\nin my garden reading Ray on Taking Turf, my man announced her name. I\r\nhad been half expecting her to come to me for advice and consolation,\r\nfor I had known her ever since she was a child. It was I who had given\r\nher her first driver and taught her infant lips to lisp \"Fore!\" It is\r\nnot easy to lisp the word \"Fore!\" but I had taught her to do it, and\r\nthis constituted a bond between us which had been strengthened rather\r\nthan weakened by the passage of time.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the grass beside my chair, and looked up at my face in\r\nsilent pain. We had known each other so long that I know that it was\r\nnot my face that pained her, but rather some unspoken _malaise_ of\r\nthe soul. I waited for her to speak, and suddenly she burst out\r\nimpetuously as though she could hold back her sorrow no longer.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can't stand it! I can't stand it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean...?\" I said, though I knew only too well.\r\n\r\n\"This horrible obsession of poor George's,\" she cried passionately. \"I\r\ndon't think he has stopped talking once since we have been engaged.\"\r\n\r\n\"He _is_ chatty,\" I agreed. \"Has he told you the story about the\r\nIrishman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Half a dozen times. And the one about the Swede oftener than that. But\r\nI would not mind an occasional anecdote. Women have to learn to bear\r\nanecdotes from the men they love. It is the curse of Eve. It is his\r\nincessant easy flow of chatter on all topics that is undermining even\r\nmy devotion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, when he proposed to you, he must have given you an inkling\r\nof the truth. He only hinted at it when he spoke to me, but I gather\r\nthat he was eloquent.\"\r\n\r\n\"When he proposed,\" said Celia dreamily, \"he was wonderful. He spoke\r\nfor twenty minutes without stopping. He said I was the essence of his\r\nevery hope, the tree on which the fruit of his life grew; his Present,\r\nhis Future, his Past ... oh, and all that sort of thing. If he would\r\nonly confine his conversation now to remarks of a similar nature, I\r\ncould listen to him all day long. But he doesn't. He talks politics and\r\nstatistics and philosophy and ... oh, and everything. He makes my head\r\nache.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your heart also, I fear,\" I said gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I love him!\" she replied simply. \"In spite of everything, I love him\r\ndearly. But what to do? What to do? I have an awful fear that when we\r\nare getting married instead of answering 'I will,' he will go into the\r\npulpit and deliver an address on Marriage Ceremonies of All Ages. The\r\nworld to him is a vast lecture-platform. He looks on life as one long\r\nafter-dinner, with himself as the principal speaker of the evening. It\r\nis breaking my heart. I see him shunned by his former friends. Shunned!\r\nThey run a mile when they see him coming. The mere sound of his voice\r\noutside the club-house is enough to send brave men diving for safety\r\nbeneath the sofas. Can you wonder that I am in despair? What have I to\r\nlive for?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is always golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is always golf,\" she whispered bravely.\r\n\r\n\"Come and have a round this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had promised to go for a walk ...\" She shuddered, then pulled herself\r\ntogether. \"... for a walk with George.\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Bring him along,\" I said, and patted her hand. \"It may be that\r\ntogether we shall find an opportunity of reasoning with him.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"You can't reason with George. He never stops talking long enough to\r\ngive you time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, there is no harm in trying. I have an idea that this\r\nmalady of his is not permanent and incurable. The very violence with\r\nwhich the germ of loquacity has attacked him gives me hope. You must\r\nremember that before this seizure he was rather a noticeably silent\r\nman. Sometimes I think that it is just Nature's way of restoring the\r\naverage, and that soon the fever may burn itself out. Or it may be that\r\na sudden shock ... At any rate, have courage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try to be brave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital! At half-past two on the first tee, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have to give me a stroke on the third, ninth, twelfth,\r\nfifteenth, sixteenth and eighteenth,\" she said, with a quaver in her\r\nvoice. \"My golf has fallen off rather lately.\"\r\n\r\nI patted her hand again.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" I said gently. \"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe steady drone of a baritone voice as I alighted from my car and\r\napproached the first tee told me that George had not forgotten the\r\ntryst. He was sitting on the stone seat under the chestnut-tree,\r\nspeaking a few well-chosen words on the Labour Movement.\r\n\r\n\"To what conclusion, then, do we come?\" he was saying. \"We come to the\r\nforegone and inevitable conclusion that....\"\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, George,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe nodded briefly, but without verbal salutation. He seemed to regard\r\nmy remark as he would have regarded the unmannerly heckling of some one\r\nat the back of the hall. He proceeded evenly with his speech, and was\r\nstill talking when Celia addressed her ball and drove off. Her drive,\r\ncoinciding with a sharp rhetorical question from George, wavered in\r\nmid-air, and the ball trickled off into the rough half-way down the\r\nhill. I can see the poor girl's tortured face even now. But she\r\nbreathed no word of reproach. Such is the miracle of women's love.\r\n\r\n\"Where you went wrong there,\" said George, breaking off his remarks on\r\nLabour, \"was that you have not studied the dynamics of golf\r\nsufficiently. You did not pivot properly. You allowed your left heel to\r\npoint down the course when you were at the top of your swing. This\r\nmakes for instability and loss of distance. The fundamental law of the\r\ndynamics of golf is that the left foot shall be solidly on the ground\r\nat the moment of impact. If you allow your heel to point down the\r\ncourse, it is almost impossible to bring it back in time to make the\r\nfoot a solid fulcrum.\"\r\n\r\nI drove, and managed to clear the rough and reach the fairway. But it\r\nwas not one of my best drives. George Mackintosh, I confess, had\r\nunnerved me. The feeling he gave me resembled the self-conscious panic\r\nwhich I used to experience in my childhood when informed that there was\r\nOne Awful Eye that watched my every movement and saw my every act. It\r\nwas only the fact that poor Celia appeared even more affected by his\r\nespionage that enabled me to win the first hole in seven.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the second tee George discoursed on the beauties of\r\nNature, pointing out at considerable length how exquisitely the silver\r\nglitter of the lake harmonized with the vivid emerald turf near the\r\nhole and the duller green of the rough beyond it. As Celia teed up her\r\nball, he directed her attention to the golden glory of the sand-pit to\r\nthe left of the flag. It was not the spirit in which to approach the\r\nlake-hole, and I was not surprised when the unfortunate girl's ball\r\nfell with a sickening plop half-way across the water.\r\n\r\n\"Where you went wrong there,\" said George, \"was that you made the\r\nstroke a sudden heave instead of a smooth, snappy flick of the wrists.\r\nPressing is always bad, but with the mashie----\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I will give you this hole,\" said Celia to me, for my shot had\r\ncleared the water and was lying on the edge of the green. \"I wish I\r\nhadn't used a new ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"The price of golf-balls,\" said George, as we started to round the\r\nlake, \"is a matter to which economists should give some attention. I am\r\ncredibly informed that rubber at the present time is exceptionally\r\ncheap. Yet we see no decrease in the price of golf-balls, which, as I\r\nneed scarcely inform you, are rubber-cored. Why should this be so? You\r\nwill say that the wages of skilled labour have gone up. True. But----\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment, George, while I drive,\" I said. For we had now arrived at\r\nthe third tee.\r\n\r\n\"A curious thing, concentration,\" said George, \"and why certain\r\nphenomena should prevent us from focusing our attention---- This brings\r\nme to the vexed question of sleep. Why is it that we are able to sleep\r\nthrough some vast convulsion of Nature when a dripping tap is enough to\r\nkeep us awake? I am told that there were people who slumbered\r\npeacefully through the San Francisco earthquake, merely stirring\r\ndrowsily from time to time to tell an imaginary person to leave it on\r\nthe mat. Yet these same people----\"\r\n\r\nCelia's drive bounded into the deep ravine which yawns some fifty yards\r\nfrom the tee. A low moan escaped her.\r\n\r\n\"Where you went wrong there----\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Celia. \"I lifted my head.\"\r\n\r\nI had never heard her speak so abruptly before. Her manner, in a girl\r\nless noticeably pretty, might almost have been called snappish. George,\r\nhowever, did not appear to have noticed anything amiss. He filled his\r\npipe and followed her into the ravine.\r\n\r\n\"Remarkable,\" he said, \"how fundamental a principle of golf is this\r\nkeeping the head still. You will hear professionals tell their pupils\r\nto keep their eye on the ball. Keeping the eye on the ball is only a\r\nsecondary matter. What they really mean is that the head should be kept\r\nrigid, as otherwise it is impossible to----\"\r\n\r\nHis voice died away. I had sliced my drive into the woods on the right,\r\nand after playing another had gone off to try to find my ball, leaving\r\nCelia and George in the ravine behind me. My last glimpse of them\r\nshowed me that her ball had fallen into a stone-studded cavity in the\r\nside of the hill, and she was drawing her niblick from her bag as I\r\npassed out of sight. George's voice, blurred by distance to a\r\nmonotonous murmur, followed me until I was out of earshot.\r\n\r\nI was just about to give up the hunt for my ball in despair, when I\r\nheard Celia's voice calling to me from the edge of the undergrowth.\r\nThere was a sharp note in it which startled me.\r\n\r\nI came out, trailing a portion of some unknown shrub which had twined\r\nitself about my ankle.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" I said, picking twigs out of my hair.\r\n\r\n\"I want your advice,\" said Celia.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. What is the trouble? By the way,\" I said, looking round,\r\n\"where is your _fiance_?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no _fiance_,\" she said, in a dull, hard voice.\r\n\r\n\"You have broken off the engagement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly. And yet--well, I suppose it amounts to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the fact is,\" said Celia, in a burst of girlish frankness, \"I\r\nrather think I've killed George.\"\r\n\r\n\"Killed him, eh?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a solution that had not occurred to me, but now that it was\r\npresented for my inspection I could see its merits. In these days of\r\nnational effort, when we are all working together to try to make our\r\nbeloved land fit for heroes to live in, it was astonishing that nobody\r\nbefore had thought of a simple, obvious thing like killing George\r\nMackintosh. George Mackintosh was undoubtedly better dead, but it had\r\ntaken a woman's intuition to see it.\r\n\r\n\"I killed him with my niblick,\" said Celia.\r\n\r\nI nodded. If the thing was to be done at all, it was unquestionably a\r\nniblick shot.\r\n\r\n\"I had just made my eleventh attempt to get out of that ravine,\" the\r\ngirl went on, \"with George talking all the time about the recent\r\nexcavations in Egypt, when suddenly--you know what it is when something\r\nseems to snap----\"\r\n\r\n\"I had the experience with my shoe-lace only this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was like that. Sharp--sudden--happening all in a moment. I\r\nsuppose I must have said something, for George stopped talking about\r\nEgypt and said that he was reminded by a remark of the last speaker's\r\nof a certain Irishman-----\"\r\n\r\nI pressed her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go on if it hurts you,\" I said, gently.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is very little more to tell. He bent his head to light his\r\npipe, and well--the temptation was too much for me. That's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were quite right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You really think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do. A rather similar action, under far less provocation,\r\nonce made Jael the wife of Heber the most popular woman in Israel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could think so too,\" she murmured. \"At the moment, you know,\r\nI was conscious of nothing but an awful elation. But--but--oh, he was\r\nsuch a darling before he got this dreadful affliction. I can't help\r\nthinking of G-George as he used to be.\"\r\n\r\nShe burst into a torrent of sobs.\r\n\r\n\"Would you care for me to view the remains?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it would be as well.\"\r\n\r\nShe led me silently into the ravine. George Mackintosh was lying on his\r\nback where he had fallen.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Celia.\r\n\r\nAnd, as she spoke, George Mackintosh gave a kind of snorting groan and\r\nsat up. Celia uttered a sharp shriek and sank on her knees before him.\r\nGeorge blinked once or twice and looked about him dazedly.\r\n\r\n\"Save the women and children!\" he cried. \"I can swim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, George!\" said Celia.\r\n\r\n\"Feeling a little better?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"A little. How many people were hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the express ran into us.\" He cast another glance around him.\r\n\"Why, how did I get here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were here all the time,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean after the roof fell in or before?\"\r\n\r\nCelia was crying quietly down the back of his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, George!\" she said, again.\r\n\r\nHe groped out feebly for her hand and patted it.\r\n\r\n\"Brave little woman!\" he said. \"Brave little woman! She stuck by me all\r\nthrough. Tell me--I am strong enough to bear it--what caused the\r\nexplosion?\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me a case where much unpleasant explanation might be\r\navoided by the exercise of a little tact.\r\n\r\n\"Well, some say one thing and some another,\" I said. \"Whether it was a\r\nspark from a cigarette----\"\r\n\r\nCelia interrupted me. The woman in her made her revolt against this\r\nwell-intentioned subterfuge.\r\n\r\n\"I hit you, George!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hit me?\" he repeated, curiously. \"What with? The Eiffel Tower?\"\r\n\r\n\"With my niblick.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hit me with your niblick? But why?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. Then she faced him bravely.\r\n\r\n\"Because you wouldn't stop talking.\"\r\n\r\nHe gaped.\r\n\r\n\"Me!\" he said. \"_I_ wouldn't stop talking! But I hardly talk at\r\nall. I'm noted for it.\"\r\n\r\nCelia's eyes met mine in agonized inquiry. But I saw what had happened.\r\nThe blow, the sudden shock, had operated on George's brain-cells in\r\nsuch a way as to effect a complete cure. I have not the technical\r\nknowledge to be able to explain it, but the facts were plain.\r\n\r\n\"Lately, my dear fellow,\" I assured him, \"you have dropped into the\r\nhabit of talking rather a good deal. Ever since we started out this\r\nafternoon you have kept up an incessant flow of conversation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Me! On the links! It isn't possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only too true, I fear. And that is why this brave girl hit you\r\nwith her niblick. You started to tell her a funny story just as she was\r\nmaking her eleventh shot to get her ball out of this ravine, and she\r\ntook what she considered the necessary steps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you ever forgive me, George?\" cried Celia.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mackintosh stared at me. Then a crimson blush mantled his face.\r\n\r\n\"So I did! It's all beginning to come back to me. Oh, heavens!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Can_ you forgive me, George?\" cried Celia again.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand in his.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive you?\" he muttered. \"Can _you_ forgive _me?_ Me--a\r\ntee-talker, a green-gabbler, a prattler on the links, the lowest form\r\nof life known to science! I am unclean, unclean!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only a little mud, dearest,\" said Celia, looking at the sleeve of\r\nhis coat. \"It will brush off when it's dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you link your lot with a man who talks when people are making\r\ntheir shots?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will never do it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have done it. And you stuck to me all through! Oh, Celia!\"\r\n\r\n\"I loved you, George!\"\r\n\r\nThe man seemed to swell with a sudden emotion. His eye lit up, and he\r\nthrust one hand into the breast of his coat while he raised the other\r\nin a sweeping gesture. For an instant he appeared on the verge of a\r\nflood of eloquence. And then, as if he had been made sharply aware of\r\nwhat it was that he intended to do, he suddenly sagged. The gleam died\r\nout of his eyes. He lowered his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must say that was rather decent of you,\" he said.\r\n\r\nA lame speech, but one that brought an infinite joy to both his\r\nhearers. For it showed that George Mackintosh was cured beyond\r\npossibility of relapse.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I must say you are rather a corker,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"George!\" cried Celia.\r\n\r\nI said nothing, but I clasped his hand; and then, taking my clubs, I\r\nretired. When I looked round she was still in his arms. I left them\r\nthere, alone together in the great silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so (concluded the Oldest Member) you see that a cure is possible,\r\nthough it needs a woman's gentle hand to bring it about. And how few\r\nwomen are capable of doing what Celia Tennant did. Apart from the\r\ndifficulty of summoning up the necessary resolution, an act like hers\r\nrequires a straight eye and a pair of strong and supple wrists. It\r\nseems to me that for the ordinary talking golfer there is no hope. And\r\nthe race seems to be getting more numerous every day. Yet the finest\r\ngolfers are always the least loquacious. It is related of the\r\nillustrious Sandy McHoots that when, on the occasion of his winning the\r\nBritish Open Championship, he was interviewed by reporters from the\r\nleading daily papers as to his views on Tariff Reform, Bimetallism, the\r\nTrial by Jury System, and the Modern Craze for Dancing, all they could\r\nextract from him was the single word \"Mphm!\" Having uttered which, he\r\nshouldered his bag and went home to tea. A great man. I wish there were\r\nmore like him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n_Ordeal By Golf_\r\n\r\n\r\nA pleasant breeze played among the trees on the terrace outside the\r\nMarvis Bay Golf and Country Club. It ruffled the leaves and cooled the\r\nforehead of the Oldest Member, who, as was his custom of a Saturday\r\nafternoon, sat in the shade on a rocking-chair, observing the younger\r\ngeneration as it hooked and sliced in the valley below. The eye of the\r\nOldest Member was thoughtful and reflective. When it looked into yours\r\nyou saw in it that perfect peace, that peace beyond understanding,\r\nwhich comes at its maximum only to the man who has given up golf.\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member has not played golf since the rubber-cored ball\r\nsuperseded the old dignified gutty. But as a spectator and philosopher\r\nhe still finds pleasure in the pastime. He is watching it now with keen\r\ninterest. His gaze, passing from the lemonade which he is sucking\r\nthrough a straw, rests upon the Saturday foursome which is struggling\r\nraggedly up the hill to the ninth green. Like all Saturday foursomes,\r\nit is in difficulties. One of the patients is zigzagging about the\r\nfairway like a liner pursued by submarines. Two others seem to be\r\ndigging for buried treasure, unless--it is too far off to be\r\ncertain--they are killing snakes. The remaining cripple, who has just\r\nfoozled a mashie-shot, is blaming his caddie. His voice, as he upbraids\r\nthe innocent child for breathing during his up-swing, comes clearly up\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member sighs. His lemonade gives a sympathetic gurgle. He\r\nputs it down on the table.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow few men, says the Oldest Member, possess the proper golfing\r\ntemperament! How few indeed, judging by the sights I see here on\r\nSaturday afternoons, possess any qualification at all for golf except a\r\npair of baggy knickerbockers and enough money to enable them to pay for\r\nthe drinks at the end of the round. The ideal golfer never loses his\r\ntemper. When I played, I never lost my temper. Sometimes, it is true, I\r\nmay, after missing a shot, have broken my club across my knees; but I\r\ndid it in a calm and judicial spirit, because the club was obviously no\r\ngood and I was going to get another one anyway. To lose one's temper at\r\ngolf is foolish. It gets you nothing, not even relief. Imitate the\r\nspirit of Marcus Aurelius. \"Whatever may befall thee,\" says that great\r\nman in his \"Meditations\", \"it was preordained for thee from\r\neverlasting. Nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by\r\nnature to bear.\" I like to think that this noble thought came to him\r\nafter he had sliced a couple of new balls into the woods, and that he\r\njotted it down on the back of his score-card. For there can be no doubt\r\nthat the man was a golfer, and a bad golfer at that. Nobody who had not\r\nhad a short putt stop on the edge of the hole could possibly have\r\nwritten the words: \"That which makes the man no worse than he was makes\r\nlife no worse. It has no power to harm, without or within.\" Yes, Marcus\r\nAurelius undoubtedly played golf, and all the evidence seems to\r\nindicate that he rarely went round in under a hundred and twenty. The\r\nniblick was his club.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Marcus Aurelius and the golfing temperament recalls to my\r\nmind the case of young Mitchell Holmes. Mitchell, when I knew him\r\nfirst, was a promising young man with a future before him in the\r\nPaterson Dyeing and Refining Company, of which my old friend, Alexander\r\nPaterson, was the president. He had many engaging qualities--among them\r\nan unquestioned ability to imitate a bulldog quarrelling with a\r\nPekingese in a way which had to be heard to be believed. It was a gift\r\nwhich made him much in demand at social gatherings in the\r\nneighbourhood, marking him off from other young men who could only\r\nalmost play the mandolin or recite bits of Gunga Din; and no doubt it\r\nwas this talent of his which first sowed the seeds of love in the heart\r\nof Millicent Boyd. Women are essentially hero-worshippers, and when a\r\nwarm-hearted girl like Millicent has heard a personable young man\r\nimitating a bulldog and a Pekingese to the applause of a crowded\r\ndrawing-room, and has been able to detect the exact point at which the\r\nPekingese leaves off and the bulldog begins, she can never feel quite\r\nthe same to other men. In short, Mitchell and Millicent were engaged,\r\nand were only waiting to be married till the former could bite the\r\nDyeing and Refining Company's ear for a bit of extra salary.\r\n\r\nMitchell Holmes had only one fault. He lost his temper when playing\r\ngolf. He seldom played a round without becoming piqued, peeved, or--in\r\nmany cases--chagrined. The caddies on our links, it was said, could\r\nalways worst other small boys in verbal argument by calling them some\r\nof the things they had heard Mitchell call his ball on discovering it\r\nin a cuppy lie. He had a great gift of language, and he used it\r\nunsparingly. I will admit that there was some excuse for the man. He\r\nhad the makings of a brilliant golfer, but a combination of bad luck\r\nand inconsistent play invariably robbed him of the fruits of his skill.\r\nHe was the sort of player who does the first two holes in one under\r\nbogey and then takes an eleven at the third. The least thing upset him\r\non the links. He missed short putts because of the uproar of the\r\nbutterflies in the adjoining meadows.\r\n\r\nIt seemed hardly likely that this one kink in an otherwise admirable\r\ncharacter would ever seriously affect his working or professional life,\r\nbut it did. One evening, as I was sitting in my garden, Alexander\r\nPaterson was announced. A glance at his face told me that he had come\r\nto ask my advice. Rightly or wrongly, he regarded me as one capable of\r\ngiving advice. It was I who had changed the whole current of his life\r\nby counselling him to leave the wood in his bag and take a driving-iron\r\noff the tee; and in one or two other matters, like the choice of a\r\nputter (so much more important than the choice of a wife), I had been\r\nof assistance to him.\r\n\r\nAlexander sat down and fanned himself with his hat, for the evening was\r\nwarm. Perplexity was written upon his fine face.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to do,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the head still--slow back--don't press,\" I said, gravely. There\r\nis no better rule for a happy and successful life.\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing to do with golf this time,\" he said. \"It's about the\r\ntreasurership of my company. Old Smithers retires next week, and I've\r\ngot to find a man to fill his place.\"\r\n\r\n\"That should be easy. You have simply to select the most deserving from\r\namong your other employees.\"\r\n\r\n\"But which _is_ the most deserving? That's the point. There are\r\ntwo men who are capable of holding the job quite adequately. But then I\r\nrealize how little I know of their real characters. It is the\r\ntreasurership, you understand, which has to be filled. Now, a man who\r\nwas quite good at another job might easily get wrong ideas into his\r\nhead when he became a treasurer. He would have the handling of large\r\nsums of money. In other words, a man who in ordinary circumstances had\r\nnever been conscious of any desire to visit the more distant portions\r\nof South America might feel the urge, so to speak, shortly after he\r\nbecame a treasurer. That is my difficulty. Of course, one always takes\r\na sporting chance with any treasurer; but how am I to find out which of\r\nthese two men would give me the more reasonable opportunity of keeping\r\nsome of my money?\"\r\n\r\nI did not hesitate a moment. I held strong views on the subject of\r\ncharacter-testing.\r\n\r\n\"The only way,\" I said to Alexander, \"of really finding out a man's\r\ntrue character is to play golf with him. In no other walk of life does\r\nthe cloven hoof so quickly display itself. I employed a lawyer for\r\nyears, until one day I saw him kick his ball out of a heel-mark. I\r\nremoved my business from his charge next morning. He has not yet run\r\noff with any trust-funds, but there is a nasty gleam in his eye, and I\r\nam convinced that it is only a question of time. Golf, my dear fellow,\r\nis the infallible test. The man who can go into a patch of rough alone,\r\nwith the knowledge that only God is watching him, and play his ball\r\nwhere it lies, is the man who will serve you faithfully and well. The\r\nman who can smile bravely when his putt is diverted by one of those\r\nbeastly wormcasts is pure gold right through. But the man who is hasty,\r\nunbalanced, and violent on the links will display the same qualities in\r\nthe wider field of everyday life. You don't want an unbalanced\r\ntreasurer do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if his books are likely to catch the complaint.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are sure to. Statisticians estimate that the average of crime\r\namong good golfers is lower than in any class of the community except\r\npossibly bishops. Since Willie Park won the first championship at\r\nPrestwick in the year 1860 there has, I believe, been no instance of an\r\nOpen Champion spending a day in prison. Whereas the bad golfers--and by\r\nbad I do not mean incompetent, but black-souled--the men who fail to\r\ncount a stroke when they miss the globe; the men who never replace a\r\ndivot; the men who talk while their opponent is driving; and the men\r\nwho let their angry passions rise--these are in and out of Wormwood\r\nScrubbs all the time. They find it hardly worth while to get their hair\r\ncut in their brief intervals of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander was visibly impressed.\r\n\r\n\"That sounds sensible, by George!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It is sensible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it! Honestly, I can't see any other way of deciding between\r\nHolmes and Dixon.\"\r\n\r\nI started.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes? Not Mitchell Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Of course you must know him? He lives here, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by Dixon do you mean Rupert Dixon?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the man. Another neighbour of yours.\"\r\n\r\nI confess that my heart sank. It was as if my ball had fallen into the\r\npit which my niblick had digged. I wished heartily that I had thought\r\nof waiting to ascertain the names of the two rivals before offering my\r\nscheme. I was extremely fond of Mitchell Holmes and of the girl to whom\r\nhe was engaged to be married. Indeed, it was I who had sketched out a\r\nfew rough notes for the lad to use when proposing; and results had\r\nshown that he had put my stuff across well. And I had listened many a\r\ntime with a sympathetic ear to his hopes in the matter of securing a\r\nrise of salary which would enable him to get married. Somehow, when\r\nAlexander was talking, it had not occurred to me that young Holmes\r\nmight be in the running for so important an office as the\r\ntreasurership. I had ruined the boy's chances. Ordeal by golf was the\r\none test which he could not possibly undergo with success. Only a\r\nmiracle could keep him from losing his temper, and I had expressly\r\nwarned Alexander against such a man.\r\n\r\nWhen I thought of his rival my heart sank still more. Rupert Dixon was\r\nrather an unpleasant young man, but the worst of his enemies could not\r\naccuse him of not possessing the golfing temperament. From the drive\r\noff the tee to the holing of the final putt he was uniformly suave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander had gone, I sat in thought for some time. I was faced\r\nwith a problem. Strictly speaking, no doubt, I had no right to take\r\nsides; and, though secrecy had not been enjoined upon me in so many\r\nwords, I was very well aware that Alexander was under the impression\r\nthat I would keep the thing under my hat and not reveal to either party\r\nthe test that awaited him. Each candidate was, of course, to remain\r\nignorant that he was taking part in anything but a friendly game.\r\n\r\nBut when I thought of the young couple whose future depended on this\r\nordeal, I hesitated no longer. I put on my hat and went round to Miss\r\nBoyd's house, where I knew that Mitchell was to be found at this hour.\r\n\r\nThe young couple were out in the porch, looking at the moon. They\r\ngreeted me heartily, but their heartiness had rather a tinny sound, and\r\nI could see that on the whole they regarded me as one of those things\r\nwhich should not happen. But when I told my story their attitude\r\nchanged. They began to look on me in the pleasanter light of a\r\nguardian, philosopher, and friend.\r\n\r\n\"Wherever did Mr. Paterson get such a silly idea?\" said Miss Boyd,\r\nindignantly. I had--from the best motives--concealed the source of the\r\nscheme. \"It's ridiculous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Mitchell. \"The old boy's crazy about golf.\r\nIt's just the sort of scheme he would cook up. Well, it dishes\r\n_me_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good saying 'Oh, come!' You know perfectly well that I'm a\r\nfrank, outspoken golfer. When my ball goes off nor'-nor'-east when I\r\nwant it to go due west I can't help expressing an opinion about it. It\r\nis a curious phenomenon which calls for comment, and I give it.\r\nSimilarly, when I top my drive, I have to go on record as saying that I\r\ndid not do it intentionally. And it's just these trifles, as far as I\r\ncan make out, that are going to decide the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you learn to control yourself on the links, Mitchell,\r\ndarling?\" asked Millicent. \"After all, golf is only a game!\"\r\n\r\nMitchell's eyes met mine, and I have no doubt that mine showed just the\r\nsame look of horror which I saw in his. Women say these things without\r\nthinking. It does not mean that there is any kink in their character.\r\nThey simply don't realize what they are saying.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Mitchell, huskily, patting her hand and overcoming his\r\nemotion with a strong effort. \"Hush, dearest!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo or three days later I met Millicent coming from the post-office.\r\nThere was a new light of happiness in her eyes, and her face was\r\nglowing.\r\n\r\n\"Such a splendid thing has happened,\" she said. \"After Mitchell left\r\nthat night I happened to be glancing through a magazine, and I came\r\nacross a wonderful advertisement. It began by saying that all the great\r\nmen in history owed their success to being able to control themselves,\r\nand that Napoleon wouldn't have amounted to anything if he had not\r\ncurbed his fiery nature, and then it said that we can all be like\r\nNapoleon if we fill in the accompanying blank order-form for Professor\r\nOrlando Rollitt's wonderful book, 'Are You Your Own Master?' absolutely\r\nfree for five days and then seven shillings, but you must write at once\r\nbecause the demand is enormous and pretty soon it may be too late. I\r\nwrote at once, and luckily I was in time, because Professor Rollitt did\r\nhave a copy left, and it's just arrived. I've been looking through it,\r\nand it seems splendid.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out a small volume. I glanced at it. There was a frontispiece\r\nshowing a signed photograph of Professor Orlando Rollitt controlling\r\nhimself in spite of having long white whiskers, and then some reading\r\nmatter, printed between wide margins. One look at the book told me the\r\nprofessor's methods. To be brief, he had simply swiped Marcus\r\nAurelius's best stuff, the copyright having expired some two thousand\r\nyears ago, and was retailing it as his own. I did not mention this to\r\nMillicent. It was no affair of mine. Presumably, however obscure the\r\nnecessity, Professor Rollitt had to live.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to start Mitchell on it today. Don't you think this is good?\r\n'Thou seest how few be the things which if a man has at his command his\r\nlife flows gently on and is divine.' I think it will be wonderful if\r\nMitchell's life flows gently on and is divine for seven shillings,\r\ndon't you?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the club-house that evening I encountered Rupert Dixon. He was\r\nemerging from a shower-bath, and looked as pleased with himself as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n\"Just been going round with old Paterson,\" he said. \"He was asking\r\nafter you. He's gone back to town in his car.\"\r\n\r\nI was thrilled. So the test had begun!\r\n\r\n\"How did you come out?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nRupert Dixon smirked. A smirking man, wrapped in a bath towel, with a\r\nwisp of wet hair over one eye, is a repellent sight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pretty well. I won by six and five. In spite of having poisonous\r\nluck.\"\r\n\r\nI felt a gleam of hope at these last words.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you had bad luck?\"\r\n\r\n\"The worst. I over-shot the green at the third with the best\r\nbrassey-shot I've ever made in my life--and that's saying a lot--and\r\nlost my ball in the rough beyond it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I suppose you let yourself go, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let myself go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I take it that you made some sort of demonstration?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. Losing your temper doesn't get you anywhere at golf. It only\r\nspoils your next shot.\"\r\n\r\nI went away heavy-hearted. Dixon had plainly come through the ordeal as\r\nwell as any man could have done. I expected to hear every day that the\r\nvacant treasurership had been filled, and that Mitchell had not even\r\nbeen called upon to play his test round. I suppose, however, that\r\nAlexander Paterson felt that it would be unfair to the other competitor\r\nnot to give him his chance, for the next I heard of the matter was when\r\nMitchell Holmes rang me up on the Friday and asked me if I would\r\naccompany him round the links next day in the match he was playing with\r\nAlexander, and give him my moral support.\r\n\r\n\"I shall need it,\" he said. \"I don't mind telling you I'm pretty\r\nnervous. I wish I had had longer to get the stranglehold on that 'Are\r\nYou Your Own Master?' stuff. I can see, of course, that it is the real\r\ntabasco from start to finish, and absolutely as mother makes it, but\r\nthe trouble is I've only had a few days to soak it into my system. It's\r\nlike trying to patch up a motor car with string. You never know when\r\nthe thing will break down. Heaven knows what will happen if I sink a\r\nball at the water-hole. And something seems to tell me I am going to do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in dreams?\" asked Mitchell.\r\n\r\n\"Believe in what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'Do you believe in dreams?' Because last night I dreamed that\r\nI was playing in the final of the Open Championship, and I got into the\r\nrough, and there was a cow there, and the cow looked at me in a sad\r\nsort of way and said, 'Why don't you use the two-V grip instead of the\r\ninterlocking?' At the time it seemed an odd sort of thing to happen,\r\nbut I've been thinking it over and I wonder if there isn't something in\r\nit. These things must be sent to us for a purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't change your grip on the day of an important match.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose not. The fact is, I'm a bit jumpy, or I wouldn't have\r\nmentioned it. Oh, well! See you tomorrow at two.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day was bright and sunny, but a tricky cross-wind was blowing when\r\nI reached the club-house. Alexander Paterson was there, practising\r\nswings on the first tee; and almost immediately Mitchell Holmes\r\narrived, accompanied by Millicent.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Alexander, \"we had better be getting under way. Shall I\r\ntake the honour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Mitchell.\r\n\r\nAlexander teed up his ball.\r\n\r\nAlexander Paterson has always been a careful rather than a dashing\r\nplayer. It is his custom, a sort of ritual, to take two measured\r\npractice-swings before addressing the ball, even on the putting-green.\r\nWhen he does address the ball he shuffles his feet for a moment or two,\r\nthen pauses, and scans the horizon in a suspicious sort of way, as if\r\nhe had been expecting it to play some sort of a trick on him when he\r\nwas not looking. A careful inspection seems to convince him of the\r\nhorizon's _bona fides_, and he turns his attention to the ball\r\nagain. He shuffles his feet once more, then raises his club. He waggles\r\nthe club smartly over the ball three times, then lays it behind the\r\nglobule. At this point he suddenly peers at the horizon again, in the\r\napparent hope of catching it off its guard. This done, he raises his\r\nclub very slowly, brings it back very slowly till it almost touches the\r\nball, raises it again, brings it down again, raises it once more, and\r\nbrings it down for the third time. He then stands motionless, wrapped\r\nin thought, like some Indian fakir contemplating the infinite. Then he\r\nraises his club again and replaces it behind the ball. Finally he\r\nquivers all over, swings very slowly back, and drives the ball for\r\nabout a hundred and fifty yards in a dead straight line.\r\n\r\nIt is a method of procedure which proves sometimes a little\r\nexasperating to the highly strung, and I watched Mitchell's face\r\nanxiously to see how he was taking his first introduction to it. The\r\nunhappy lad had blenched visibly. He turned to me with the air of one\r\nin pain.\r\n\r\n\"Does he always do that?\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Always,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm done for! No human being could play golf against a one-ring\r\ncircus like that without blowing up!\"\r\n\r\nI said nothing. It was, I feared, only too true. Well-poised as I am, I\r\nhad long since been compelled to give up playing with Alexander\r\nPaterson, much as I esteemed him. It was a choice between that and\r\nresigning from the Baptist Church.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Millicent spoke. There was an open book in her hand. I\r\nrecognized it as the life-work of Professor Rollitt.\r\n\r\n\"Think on this doctrine,\" she said, in her soft, modulated voice, \"that\r\nto be patient is a branch of justice, and that men sin without\r\nintending it.\"\r\n\r\nMitchell nodded briefly, and walked to the tee with a firm step.\r\n\r\n\"Before you drive, darling,\" said Millicent, \"remember this. Let no act\r\nbe done at haphazard, nor otherwise than according to the finished\r\nrules that govern its kind.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment Mitchell's ball was shooting through the air, to come\r\nto rest two hundred yards down the course. It was a magnificent drive.\r\nHe had followed the counsel of Marcus Aurelius to the letter.\r\n\r\nAn admirable iron-shot put him in reasonable proximity to the pin, and\r\nhe holed out in one under bogey with one of the nicest putts I have\r\never beheld. And when at the next hole, the dangerous water-hole, his\r\nball soared over the pond and lay safe, giving him bogey for the hole,\r\nI began for the first time to breathe freely. Every golfer has his day,\r\nand this was plainly Mitchell's. He was playing faultless golf. If he\r\ncould continue in this vein, his unfortunate failing would have no\r\nchance to show itself.\r\n\r\nThe third hole is long and tricky. You drive over a ravine--or possibly\r\ninto it. In the latter event you breathe a prayer and call for your\r\nniblick. But, once over the ravine, there is nothing to disturb the\r\nequanimity. Bogey is five, and a good drive, followed by a\r\nbrassey-shot, will put you within easy mashie-distance of the green.\r\n\r\nMitchell cleared the ravine by a hundred and twenty yards. He strolled\r\nback to me, and watched Alexander go through his ritual with an\r\nindulgent smile. I knew just how he was feeling. Never does the world\r\nseem so sweet and fair and the foibles of our fellow human beings so\r\nlittle irritating as when we have just swatted the pill right on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\"I can't see why he does it,\" said Mitchell, eyeing Alexander with a\r\ntoleration that almost amounted to affection. \"If I did all those\r\nSwedish exercises before I drove, I should forget what I had come out\r\nfor and go home.\" Alexander concluded the movements, and landed a bare\r\nthree yards on the other side of the ravine. \"He's what you would call\r\na steady performer, isn't he? Never varies!\"\r\n\r\nMitchell won the hole comfortably. There was a jauntiness about his\r\nstance on the fourth tee which made me a little uneasy. Over-confidence\r\nat golf is almost as bad as timidity.\r\n\r\nMy apprehensions were justified. Mitchell topped his ball. It rolled\r\ntwenty yards into the rough, and nestled under a dock-leaf. His mouth\r\nopened, then closed with a snap. He came over to where Millicent and I\r\nwere standing.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say it!\" he said. \"What on earth happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Search men's governing principles,\" said Millicent, \"and consider the\r\nwise, what they shun and what they cleave to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" I said. \"You swayed your body.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now I've got to go and look for that infernal ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, darling,\" said Millicent. \"Nothing has such power to\r\nbroaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly\r\nall that comes under thy observation in life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" I said, \"you're three up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan't be after this hole.\"\r\n\r\nHe was right. Alexander won it in five, one above bogey, and regained\r\nthe honour.\r\n\r\nMitchell was a trifle shaken. His play no longer had its first careless\r\nvigour. He lost the next hole, halved the sixth, lost the short\r\nseventh, and then, rallying, halved the eighth.\r\n\r\nThe ninth hole, like so many on our links, can be a perfectly simple\r\nfour, although the rolling nature of the green makes bogey always a\r\nsomewhat doubtful feat; but, on the other hand, if you foozle your\r\ndrive, you can easily achieve double figures. The tee is on the farther\r\nside of the pond, beyond the bridge, where the water narrows almost to\r\nthe dimensions of a brook. You drive across this water and over a\r\ntangle of trees and under-growth on the other bank. The distance to the\r\nfairway cannot be more than sixty yards, for the hazard is purely a\r\nmental one, and yet how many fair hopes have been wrecked there!\r\n\r\nAlexander cleared the obstacles comfortably with his customary short,\r\nstraight drive, and Mitchell advanced to the tee.\r\n\r\nI think the loss of the honour had been preying on his mind. He seemed\r\nnervous. His up-swing was shaky, and he swayed back perceptibly. He\r\nmade a lunge at the ball, sliced it, and it struck a tree on the other\r\nside of the water and fell in the long grass. We crossed the bridge to\r\nlook for it; and it was here that the effect of Professor Rollitt began\r\ndefinitely to wane.\r\n\r\n\"Why on earth don't they mow this darned stuff?\" demanded Mitchell,\r\nquerulously, as he beat about the grass with his niblick.\r\n\r\n\"You have to have rough on a course,\" I ventured.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever happens at all,\" said Millicent, \"happens as it should. Thou\r\nwilt find this true if thou shouldst watch narrowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well,\" said Mitchell, watching narrowly in a clump of\r\nweeds but seeming unconvinced. \"I believe the Greens Committee run this\r\nbally club purely in the interests of the caddies. I believe they\r\nencourage lost balls, and go halves with the little beasts when they\r\nfind them and sell them!\"\r\n\r\nMillicent and I exchanged glances. There were tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mitchell! Remember Napoleon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon! What's Napoleon got to do with it? Napoleon never was\r\nexpected to drive through a primeval forest. Besides, what did Napoleon\r\never do? Where did Napoleon get off, swanking round as if he amounted\r\nto something? Poor fish! All he ever did was to get hammered at\r\nWaterloo!\"\r\n\r\nAlexander rejoined us. He had walked on to where his ball lay.\r\n\r\n\"Can't find it, eh? Nasty bit of rough, this!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I can't find it. But tomorrow some miserable, chinless,\r\nhalf-witted reptile of a caddie with pop eyes and eight hundred and\r\nthirty-seven pimples will find it, and will sell it to someone for\r\nsixpence! No, it was a brand-new ball. He'll probably get a shilling\r\nfor it. That'll be sixpence for himself and sixpence for the Greens\r\nCommittee. No wonder they're buying cars quicker than the makers can\r\nsupply them. No wonder you see their wives going about in mink coats\r\nand pearl necklaces. Oh, dash it! I'll drop another!\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" Alexander pointed out, \"you will, of course, under the\r\nrules governing match-play, lose the hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then. I'll give up the hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that, I think, makes me one up on the first nine,\" said\r\nAlexander. \"Excellent! A very pleasant, even game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pleasant! On second thoughts I don't believe the Greens Committee let\r\nthe wretched caddies get any of the loot. They hang round behind trees\r\ntill the deal's concluded, and then sneak out and choke it out of\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nI saw Alexander raise his eyebrows. He walked up the hill to the next\r\ntee with me.\r\n\r\n\"Rather a quick-tempered young fellow, Holmes!\" he said, thoughtfully.\r\n\"I should never have suspected it. It just shows how little one can\r\nknow of a man, only meeting him in business hours.\"\r\n\r\nI tried to defend the poor lad.\r\n\r\n\"He has an excellent heart, Alexander. But the fact is--we are such old\r\nfriends that I know you will forgive my mentioning it--your style of\r\nplay gets, I fancy, a little on his nerves.\"\r\n\r\n\"My style of play? What's wrong with my style of play?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is actually wrong with it, but to a young and ardent spirit\r\nthere is apt to be something a trifle upsetting in being, compelled to\r\nwatch a man play quite so slowly as you do. Come now, Alexander, as one\r\nfriend to another, is it necessary to take two practice-swings before\r\nyou putt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Alexander. \"You really mean to say that that upsets\r\nhim? Well, I'm afraid I am too old to change my methods now.\"\r\n\r\nI had nothing more to say.\r\n\r\nAs we reached the tenth tee, I saw that we were in for a few minutes'\r\nwait. Suddenly I felt a hand on my arm. Millicent was standing beside\r\nme, dejection written on her face. Alexander and young Mitchell were\r\nsome distance away from us.\r\n\r\n\"Mitchell doesn't want me to come round the rest of the way with him,\"\r\nshe said, despondently. \"He says I make him nervous.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"That's bad! I was looking on you as a steadying influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I was, too. But Mitchell says no. He says my being there\r\nkeeps him from concentrating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps it would be better for you to remain in the club-house\r\ntill we return. There is, I fear, dirty work ahead.\"\r\n\r\nA choking sob escaped the unhappy girl.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so. There is an apple tree near the thirteenth hole, and\r\nMitchell's caddie is sure to start eating apples. I am thinking of what\r\nMitchell will do when he hears the crunching when he is addressing his\r\nball.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our only hope,\" she said, holding out Professor Rollitt's book, \"is\r\nthis. Will you please read him extracts when you see him getting\r\nnervous? We went through the book last night and marked all the\r\npassages in blue pencil which might prove helpful. You will see notes\r\nagainst them in the margin, showing when each is supposed to be used.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a small favour to ask. I took the book and gripped her hand\r\nsilently. Then I joined Alexander and Mitchell on the tenth tee.\r\nMitchell was still continuing his speculations regarding the Greens\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\"The hole after this one,\" he said, \"used to be a short hole. There was\r\nno chance of losing a ball. Then, one day, the wife of one of the\r\nGreens Committee happened to mention that the baby needed new shoes, so\r\nnow they've tacked on another hundred and fifty yards to it. You have\r\nto drive over the brow of a hill, and if you slice an eighth of an inch\r\nyou get into a sort of No Man's Land, full of rocks and bushes and\r\ncrevices and old pots and pans. The Greens Committee practically live\r\nthere in the summer. You see them prowling round in groups, encouraging\r\neach other with merry cries as they fill their sacks. Well, I'm going\r\nto fool them today. I'm going to drive an old ball which is just\r\nhanging together by a thread. It'll come to pieces when they pick it\r\nup!\"\r\n\r\nGolf, however, is a curious game--a game of fluctuations. One might\r\nhave supposed that Mitchell, in such a frame of mind, would have\r\ncontinued to come to grief. But at the beginning of the second nine he\r\nonce more found his form. A perfect drive put him in position to reach\r\nthe tenth green with an iron-shot, and, though the ball was several\r\nyards from the hole, he laid it dead with his approach-putt and holed\r\nhis second for a bogey four. Alexander could only achieve a five, so\r\nthat they were all square again.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh, the subject of Mitchell's recent criticism, is certainly\r\na tricky hole, and it is true that a slice does land the player in\r\ngrave difficulties. Today, however, both men kept their drives\r\nstraight, and found no difficulty in securing fours.\r\n\r\n\"A little more of this,\" said Mitchell, beaming, \"and the Greens\r\nCommittee will have to give up piracy and go back to work.\"\r\n\r\nThe twelfth is a long, dog-leg hole, bogey five. Alexander plugged\r\nsteadily round the bend, holing out in six, and Mitchell, whose second\r\nshot had landed him in some long grass, was obliged to use his niblick.\r\nHe contrived, however, to halve the hole with a nicely-judged\r\nmashie-shot to the edge of the green.\r\n\r\nAlexander won the thirteenth. It is a three hundred and sixty yard\r\nhole, free from bunkers. It took Alexander three strokes to reach the\r\ngreen, but his third laid the ball dead; while Mitchell, who was on in\r\ntwo, required three putts.\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me,\" said Alexander, chattily, \"of a story I heard.\r\nFriend calls out to a beginner, 'How are you getting on, old man?' and\r\nthe beginner says, 'Splendidly. I just made three perfect putts on the\r\nlast green!'\"\r\n\r\nMitchell did not appear amused. I watched his face anxiously. He had\r\nmade no remark, but the missed putt which would have saved the hole had\r\nbeen very short, and I feared the worst. There was a brooding look in\r\nhis eye as we walked to the fourteenth tee.\r\n\r\nThere are few more picturesque spots in the whole of the countryside\r\nthan the neighbourhood of the fourteenth tee. It is a sight to charm\r\nthe nature-lover's heart.\r\n\r\nBut, if golf has a defect, it is that it prevents a man being a\r\nwhole-hearted lover of nature. Where the layman sees waving grass and\r\nromantic tangles of undergrowth, your golfer beholds nothing but a\r\nnasty patch of rough from which he must divert his ball. The cry of the\r\nbirds, wheeling against the sky, is to the golfer merely something that\r\nmay put him off his putt. As a spectator, I am fond of the ravine at\r\nthe bottom of the slope. It pleases the eye. But, as a golfer, I have\r\nfrequently found it the very devil.\r\n\r\nThe last hole had given Alexander the honour again. He drove even more\r\ndeliberately than before. For quite half a minute he stood over his\r\nball, pawing at it with his driving-iron like a cat investigating a\r\ntortoise. Finally he despatched it to one of the few safe spots on the\r\nhillside. The drive from this tee has to be carefully calculated, for,\r\nif it be too straight, it will catch the slope and roll down into the\r\nravine.\r\n\r\nMitchell addressed his ball. He swung up, and then, from immediately\r\nbehind him came a sudden sharp crunching sound. I looked quickly in the\r\ndirection whence it came. Mitchell's caddie, with a glassy look in his\r\neyes, was gnawing a large apple. And even as I breathed a silent\r\nprayer, down came the driver, and the ball, with a terrible slice on\r\nit, hit the side of the hill and bounded into the ravine.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause--a pause in which the world stood still. Mitchell\r\ndropped his club and turned. His face was working horribly.\r\n\r\n\"Mitchell!\" I cried. \"My boy! Reflect! Be calm!\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm! What's the use of being calm when people are chewing apples in\r\nthousands all round you? What _is_ this, anyway--a golf match or a\r\npleasant day's outing for the children of the poor? Apples! Go on, my\r\nboy, take another bite. Take several. Enjoy yourself! Never mind if it\r\nseems to cause me a fleeting annoyance. Go on with your lunch! You\r\nprobably had a light breakfast, eh, and are feeling a little peckish,\r\nyes? If you will wait here, I will run to the clubhouse and get you a\r\nsandwich and a bottle of ginger-ale. Make yourself quite at home, you\r\nlovable little fellow! Sit down and have a good time!\"\r\n\r\nI turned the pages of Professor Rollitt's book feverishly. I could not\r\nfind a passage that had been marked in blue pencil to meet this\r\nemergency. I selected one at random.\r\n\r\n\"Mitchell,\" I said, \"one moment. How much time he gains who does not\r\nlook to see what his neighbour says or does, but only at what he does\r\nhimself, to make it just and holy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, look what I've done myself! I'm somewhere down at the bottom of\r\nthat dashed ravine, and it'll take me a dozen strokes to get out. Do\r\nyou call that just and holy? Here, give me that book for a moment!\"\r\n\r\nHe snatched the little volume out of my hands. For an instant he looked\r\nat it with a curious expression of loathing, then he placed it gently\r\non the ground and jumped on it a few times. Then he hit it with his\r\ndriver. Finally, as if feeling that the time for half measures had\r\npassed, he took a little run and kicked it strongly into the long\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Alexander, who had been an impassive spectator of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\"I'm through!\" he said. \"I concede the match. Good-bye. You'll find me\r\nin the bay!\"\r\n\r\n\"Going swimming?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Drowning myself.\"\r\n\r\nA gentle smile broke out over my old friend's usually grave face. He\r\npatted Mitchell's shoulder affectionately.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that, my boy,\" he said. \"I was hoping you would stick around\r\nthe office awhile as treasurer of the company.\"\r\n\r\nMitchell tottered. He grasped my arm for support. Everything was very\r\nstill. Nothing broke the stillness but the humming of the bees, the\r\nmurmur of the distant wavelets, and the sound of Mitchell's caddie\r\ngoing on with his apple.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Mitchell.\r\n\r\n\"The position,\" said Alexander, \"will be falling vacant very shortly,\r\nas no doubt you know. It is yours, if you care to accept it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--you mean--you're going to give me the job?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have interpreted me exactly.\"\r\n\r\nMitchell gulped. So did his caddie. One from a spiritual, the other\r\nfrom a physical cause.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind excusing me,\" said Mitchell, huskily, \"I think I'll\r\nbe popping back to the club-house. Someone I want to see.\"\r\n\r\nHe disappeared through the trees, running strongly. I turned to\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\" I asked. \"I am delighted, but what becomes of\r\nthe test?\"\r\n\r\nMy old friend smiled gently.\r\n\r\n\"The test,\" he replied, \"has been eminently satisfactory.\r\nCircumstances, perhaps, have compelled me to modify the original idea\r\nof it, but nevertheless it has been a completely successful test. Since\r\nwe started out, I have been doing a good deal of thinking, and I have\r\ncome to the conclusion that what the Paterson Dyeing and Refining\r\nCompany really needs is a treasurer whom I can beat at golf. And I have\r\ndiscovered the ideal man. Why,\" he went on, a look of holy enthusiasm\r\non his fine old face, \"do you realize that I can always lick the\r\nstuffing out of that boy, good player as he is, simply by taking a\r\nlittle trouble? I can make him get the wind up every time, simply by\r\ntaking one or two extra practice-swings! That is the sort of man I need\r\nfor a responsible post in my office.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about Rupert Dixon?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe gave a gesture of distaste.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't trust that man. Why, when I played with him, everything\r\nwent wrong, and he just smiled and didn't say a word. A man who can do\r\nthat is not the man to trust with the control of large sums of money.\r\nIt wouldn't be safe. Why, the fellow isn't honest! He can't be.\" He\r\npaused for a moment. \"Besides,\" he added, thoughtfully, \"he beat me by\r\nsix and five. What's the good of a treasurer who beats the boss by six\r\nand five?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n_The Long Hole_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young man, as he sat filling his pipe in the club-house\r\nsmoking-room, was inclined to be bitter.\r\n\r\n\"If there's one thing that gives me a pain squarely in the centre of\r\nthe gizzard,\" he burst out, breaking a silence that had lasted for some\r\nminutes, \"it's a golf-lawyer. They oughtn't to be allowed on the\r\nlinks.\"\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member, who had been meditatively putting himself outside a\r\ncup of tea and a slice of seed-cake, raised his white eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"The Law,\" he said, \"is an honourable profession. Why should its\r\npractitioners be restrained from indulgence in the game of games?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean actual lawyers,\" said the young man, his acerbity\r\nmellowing a trifle under the influence of tobacco. \"I mean the\r\nblighters whose best club is the book of rules. You know the sort of\r\nexcrescences. Every time you think you've won a hole, they dig out Rule\r\neight hundred and fifty-three, section two, sub-section four, to prove\r\nthat you've disqualified yourself by having an ingrowing toe-nail.\r\nWell, take my case.\" The young man's voice was high and plaintive. \"I\r\ngo out with that man Hemmingway to play an ordinary friendly\r\nround--nothing depending on it except a measly ball--and on the seventh\r\nhe pulls me up and claims the hole simply because I happened to drop my\r\nniblick in the bunker. Oh, well, a tick's a tick, and there's nothing\r\nmore to say, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sage shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Rules are rules, my boy, and must be kept. It is odd that you should\r\nhave brought up this subject, for only a moment before you came in I\r\nwas thinking of a somewhat curious match which ultimately turned upon a\r\nquestion of the rule-book. It is true that, as far as the actual prize\r\nwas concerned, it made little difference. But perhaps I had better tell\r\nyou the whole story from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man shifted uneasily in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know, I've had a pretty rotten time this afternoon\r\nalready----\"\r\n\r\n\"I will call my story,\" said the Sage, tranquilly, \"'The Long Hole',\r\nfor it involved the playing of what I am inclined to think must be the\r\nlongest hole in the history of golf. In its beginnings the story may\r\nremind you of one I once told you about Peter Willard and James Todd,\r\nbut you will find that it develops in quite a different manner. Ralph\r\nBingham....\"\r\n\r\n\"I half promised to go and see a man----\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will begin at the beginning,\" said the Sage. \"I see that you are\r\nall impatience to hear the full details.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRalph Bingham and Arthur Jukes (said the Oldest Member) had never been\r\nfriends--their rivalry was too keen to admit of that--but it was not\r\ntill Amanda Trivett came to stay here that a smouldering distaste for\r\neach other burst out into the flames of actual enmity. It is ever so.\r\nOne of the poets, whose name I cannot recall, has a passage, which I am\r\nunable at the moment to remember, in one of his works, which for the\r\ntime being has slipped my mind, which hits off admirably this age-old\r\nsituation. The gist of his remarks is that lovely woman rarely fails to\r\nstart something. In the weeks that followed her arrival, being in the\r\nsame room with the two men was like dropping in on a reunion of\r\nCapulets and Montagues.\r\n\r\nYou see, Ralph and Arthur were so exactly equal in their skill on the\r\nlinks that life for them had for some time past resolved itself into a\r\nsilent, bitter struggle in which first one, then the other, gained some\r\nslight advantage. If Ralph won the May medal by a stroke, Arthur would\r\nbe one ahead in the June competition, only to be nosed out again in\r\nJuly. It was a state of affairs which, had they been men of a more\r\ngenerous stamp, would have bred a mutual respect, esteem, and even\r\nlove. But I am sorry to say that, apart from their golf, which was in a\r\nclass of its own as far as this neighbourhood was concerned, Ralph\r\nBingham and Arthur Jukes were a sorry pair--and yet, mark you, far from\r\nlacking in mere superficial good looks. They were handsome fellows,\r\nboth of them, and well aware of the fact; and when Amanda Trivett came\r\nto stay they simply straightened their ties, twirled their moustaches,\r\nand expected her to do the rest.\r\n\r\nBut there they were disappointed. Perfectly friendly though she was to\r\nboth of them, the lovelight was conspicuously absent from her beautiful\r\neyes. And it was not long before each had come independently to a\r\nsolution of this mystery. It was plain to them that the whole trouble\r\nlay in the fact that each neutralized the other's attractions. Arthur\r\nfelt that, if he could only have a clear field, all would be over\r\nexcept the sending out of the wedding invitations; and Ralph was of the\r\nopinion that, if he could just call on the girl one evening without\r\nfinding the place all littered up with Arthur, his natural charms would\r\nswiftly bring home the bacon. And, indeed, it was true that they had no\r\nrivals except themselves. It happened at the moment that Woodhaven was\r\nvery short of eligible bachelors. We marry young in this delightful\r\nspot, and all the likely men were already paired off. It seemed that,\r\nif Amanda Trivett intended to get married, she would have to select\r\neither Ralph Bingham or Arthur Jukes. A dreadful choice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had not occurred to me at the outset that my position in the affair\r\nwould be anything closer than that of a detached and mildly interested\r\nspectator. Yet it was to me that Ralph came in his hour of need. When I\r\nreturned home one evening, I found that my man had brought him in and\r\nlaid him on the mat in my sitting-room.\r\n\r\nI offered him a chair and a cigar, and he came to the point with\r\ncommendable rapidity.\r\n\r\n\"Leigh,\" he said, directly he had lighted his cigar, \"is too small for\r\nArthur Jukes and myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you have been talking it over and decided to move?\" I said,\r\ndelighted. \"I think you are perfectly right. Leigh _is_ over-built.\r\nMen like you and Jukes need a lot of space. Where do you think of\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you said----\"\r\n\r\n\"What I meant was that the time has come when one of us must leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, only one of you?\" It was something, of course, but I confess I was\r\ndisappointed, and I think my disappointment must have shown in my\r\nvoice; for he looked at me, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Surely you wouldn't mind Jukes going?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly not. He really is going, is he?\"\r\n\r\nA look of saturnine determination came into Ralph's face.\r\n\r\n\"He is. He thinks he isn't, but he is.\"\r\n\r\nI failed to understand him, and said so. He looked cautiously about the\r\nroom, as if to reassure himself that he could not be overheard.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you've noticed,\" he said, \"the disgusting way that man Jukes\r\nhas been hanging round Miss Trivett, boring her to death?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen them together sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love Amanda Trivett!\" said Ralph.\r\n\r\n\"Poor girl!\" I sighed.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor girl!\" I said. \"I mean, to have Arthur Jukes hanging round her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I think,\" said Ralph Bingham. \"And that's why we're\r\ngoing to play this match.\"\r\n\r\n\"What match?\"\r\n\r\n\"This match we've decided to play. I want you to act as one of the\r\njudges, to go along with Jukes and see that he doesn't play any of his\r\ntricks. You know what he is! And in a vital match like this----\"\r\n\r\n\"How much are you playing for?\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole world!\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole world. It amounts to that. The loser is to leave Leigh for\r\ngood, and the winner stays on and marries Amanda Trivett. We have\r\narranged all the details. Rupert Bailey will accompany me, acting as\r\nthe other judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you want me to go round with Jukes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not round,\" said Ralph Bingham. \"Along.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the distinction?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not going to play a round. Only one hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sudden death, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so very sudden. It's a longish hole. We start on the first tee\r\nhere and hole out in the town in the doorway of the Majestic Hotel in\r\nRoyal Square. A distance, I imagine, of about sixteen miles.\"\r\n\r\nI was revolted. About that time a perfect epidemic of freak matches had\r\nbroken out in the club, and I had strongly opposed them from the start.\r\nGeorge Willis had begun it by playing a medal round with the pro.,\r\nGeorge's first nine against the pro.'s complete eighteen. After that\r\ncame the contest between Herbert Widgeon and Montague Brown, the\r\nlatter, a twenty-four handicap man, being entitled to shout \"Boo!\"\r\nthree times during the round at moments selected by himself. There had\r\nbeen many more of these degrading travesties on the sacred game, and I\r\nhad writhed to see them. Playing freak golf-matches is to my mind like\r\nragging a great classical melody. But of the whole collection this one,\r\nconsidering the sentimental interest and the magnitude of the stakes,\r\nseemed to me the most terrible. My face, I imagine, betrayed my\r\ndisgust, for Bingham attempted extenuation.\r\n\r\n\"It's the only way,\" he said. \"You know how Jukes and I are on the\r\nlinks. We are as level as two men can be. This, of course is due to his\r\nextraordinary luck. Everybody knows that he is the world's champion\r\nfluker. I, on the other hand, invariably have the worst luck. The\r\nconsequence is that in an ordinary round it is always a toss-up which\r\nof us wins. The test we propose will eliminate luck. After sixteen\r\nmiles of give-and-take play, I am certain--that is to say, the better\r\nman is certain to be ahead. That is what I meant when I said that\r\nArthur Jukes would shortly be leaving Leigh. Well, may I take it that\r\nyou will consent to act as one of the judges?\"\r\n\r\nI considered. After all, the match was likely to be historic, and one\r\nalways feels tempted to hand one's name down to posterity.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. You will have to keep a sharp eye on Jukes, I need scarcely\r\nremind you. You will, of course, carry a book of the rules in your\r\npocket and refer to them when you wish to refresh your memory. We start\r\nat daybreak, for, if we put it off till later, the course at the other\r\nend might be somewhat congested when we reached it. We want to avoid\r\npublicity as far as possible. If I took a full iron and hit a\r\npoliceman, it would excite a remark.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would. I can tell you the exact remark which it would excite.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will take bicycles with us, to minimize the fatigue of covering the\r\ndistance. Well, I am glad that we have your co-operation. At daybreak\r\ntomorrow on the first tee, and don't forget to bring your rule-book.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere brooding over the first tee when I reached it on the\r\nfollowing morning, somewhat resembled that of a duelling-ground in the\r\ndays when these affairs were sealed with rapiers or pistols. Rupert\r\nBailey, an old friend of mine, was the only cheerful member of the\r\nparty. I am never at my best in the early morning, and the two rivals\r\nglared at each other with silent sneers. I had never supposed till that\r\nmoment that men ever really sneered at one another outside the movies,\r\nbut these two were indisputably doing so. They were in the mood when\r\nmen say \"Pshaw!\"\r\n\r\nThey tossed for the honour, and Arthur Jukes, having won, drove off\r\nwith a fine ball that landed well down the course. Ralph Bingham,\r\nhaving teed up, turned to Rupert Bailey.\r\n\r\n\"Go down on to the fairway of the seventeenth,\" he said. \"I want you to\r\nmark my ball.\"\r\n\r\nRupert stared.\r\n\r\n\"The seventeenth!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to take that direction,\" said Ralph, pointing over the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\"But that will land your second or third shot in the lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have provided for that. I have a fiat-bottomed boat moored close by\r\nthe sixteenth green. I shall use a mashie-niblick and chip my ball\r\naboard, row across to the other side, chip it ashore, and carry on. I\r\npropose to go across country as far as Woodfield. I think it will save\r\nme a stroke or two.\"\r\n\r\nI gasped. I had never before realized the man's devilish cunning. His\r\ntactics gave him a flying start. Arthur, who had driven straight down\r\nthe course, had as his objective the high road, which adjoins the waste\r\nground beyond the first green. Once there, he would play the orthodox\r\ngame by driving his ball along till he reached the bridge. While Arthur\r\nwas winding along the high road, Ralph would have cut off practically\r\ntwo sides of a triangle. And it was hopeless for Arthur to imitate his\r\nenemy's tactics now. From where his ball lay he would have to cross a\r\nwide tract of marsh in order to reach the seventeenth fairway--an\r\nimpossible feat. And, even if it had been feasible, he had no boat to\r\ntake him across the water.\r\n\r\nHe uttered a violent protest. He was an unpleasant young man,\r\nalmost--it seems absurd to say so, but almost as unpleasant as Ralph\r\nBingham; yet at the moment I am bound to say I sympathized with him.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" he demanded. \"You can't play fast and loose with\r\nthe rules like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"To what rule do you refer?\" said Ralph, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that bally boat of yours is a hazard, isn't it? And you can't\r\nrow a hazard about all over the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nThe simple question seemed to take Arthur Jukes aback.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he repeated. \"Why not? Well, you can't. That's why.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in the rules,\" said Ralph Bingham, \"against moving a\r\nhazard. If a hazard can be moved without disturbing the ball, you are\r\nat liberty, I gather, to move it wherever you please. Besides, what is\r\nall this about moving hazards? I have a perfect right to go for a\r\nmorning row, haven't I? If I were to ask my doctor, he would probably\r\nactually recommend it. I am going to row my boat across the sound. If\r\nit happens to have my ball on board, that is not my affair. I shall not\r\ndisturb my ball, and I shall play it from where it lies. Am I right in\r\nsaying that the rules enact that the ball shall be played from where it\r\nlies?\"\r\n\r\nWe admitted that it was.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said Ralph Bingham. \"Don't let us waste any more\r\ntime. We will wait for you at Woodfield.\"\r\n\r\nHe addressed his ball, and drove a beauty over the trees. It flashed\r\nout of sight in the direction of the seventeenth tee. Arthur and I made\r\nour way down the hill to play our second.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a curious trait of the human mind that, however little personal\r\ninterest one may have in the result, it is impossible to prevent\r\noneself taking sides in any event of a competitive nature. I had\r\nembarked on this affair in a purely neutral spirit, not caring which of\r\nthe two won and only sorry that both could not lose. Yet, as the\r\nmorning wore on, I found myself almost unconsciously becoming\r\ndistinctly pro-Jukes. I did not like the man. I objected to his face,\r\nhis manners, and the colour of his tie. Yet there was something in the\r\ndogged way in which he struggled against adversity which touched me and\r\nwon my grudging support. Many men, I felt, having been so outmanoeuvred\r\nat the start, would have given up the contest in despair; but Arthur\r\nJukes, for all his defects, had the soul of a true golfer. He declined\r\nto give up. In grim silence he hacked his ball through the rough till\r\nhe reached the high road; and then, having played twenty-seven, set\r\nhimself resolutely to propel it on its long journey.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely morning, and, as I bicycled along, keeping a fatherly\r\neye on Arthur's activities, I realized for the first time in my life\r\nthe full meaning of that exquisite phrase of Coleridge:\r\n\r\n    _\"Clothing the palpable and familiar\r\n    With golden exhalations of the dawn,\"_\r\n\r\nfor in the pellucid air everything seemed weirdly beautiful, even\r\nArthur Jukes' heather-mixture knickerbockers, of which hitherto I had\r\nnever approved. The sun gleamed on their seat, as he bent to make his\r\nshots, in a cheerful and almost a poetic way. The birds were singing\r\ngaily in the hedgerows, and such was my uplifted state that I, too,\r\nburst into song, until Arthur petulantly desired me to refrain, on the\r\nplea that, though he yielded to no man in his enjoyment of farmyard\r\nimitations in their proper place, I put him off his stroke. And so we\r\npassed through Bayside in silence and started to cover that long\r\nstretch of road which ends in the railway bridge and the gentle descent\r\ninto Woodfield.\r\n\r\nArthur was not doing badly. He was at least keeping them straight. And\r\nin the circumstances straightness was to be preferred to distance. Soon\r\nafter leaving Little Hadley he had become ambitious and had used his\r\nbrassey with disastrous results, slicing his fifty-third into the rough\r\non the right of the road. It had taken him ten with the niblick to get\r\nback on to the car tracks, and this had taught him prudence.\r\n\r\nHe was now using his putter for every shot, and, except when he got\r\ntrapped in the cross-lines at the top of the hill just before reaching\r\nBayside, he had been in no serious difficulties. He was playing a nice\r\neasy game, getting the full face of the putter on to each shot.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the slope that drops down into Woodfield High Street he\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\"I think I might try my brassey again here,\" he said. \"I have a nice\r\nlie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it wise?\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked down the hill.\r\n\r\n\"What I was thinking,\" he said, \"was that with it I might wing that man\r\nBingham. I see he is standing right out in the middle of the fairway.\"\r\n\r\nI followed his gaze. It was perfectly true. Ralph Bingham was leaning\r\non his bicycle in the roadway, smoking a cigarette. Even at this\r\ndistance one could detect the man's disgustingly complacent expression.\r\nRupert Bailey was sitting with his back against the door of the\r\nWoodfield Garage, looking rather used up. He was a man who liked to\r\nkeep himself clean and tidy, and it was plain that the cross-country\r\ntrip had done him no good. He seemed to be scraping mud off his face. I\r\nlearned later that he had had the misfortune to fall into a ditch just\r\nbeyond Bayside.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Arthur. \"On second thoughts, the safe game is the one to\r\nplay. I'll stick to the putter.\"\r\n\r\nWe dropped down the hill, and presently came up with the opposition. I\r\nhad not been mistaken in thinking that Ralph Bingham looked complacent.\r\nThe man was smirking.\r\n\r\n\"Playing three hundred and ninety-six,\" he said, as we drew near. \"How\r\nare you?\"\r\n\r\nI consulted my score-card.\r\n\r\n\"We have played a snappy seven hundred and eleven.\" I said.\r\n\r\nRalph exulted openly. Rupert Bailey made no comment. He was too busy\r\nwith the alluvial deposits on his person.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to give up the match?\" said Ralph to Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Tchah!\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Might just as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pah!\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"You can't win now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\nI am aware that Arthur's dialogue might have been brighter, but he had\r\nbeen through a trying time.\r\n\r\nRupert Bailey sidled up to me.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going home,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I replied. \"You are in an official capacity. You must stick\r\nto your post. Besides, what could be nicer than a pleasant morning\r\nramble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pleasant morning ramble my number nine foot!\" he replied, peevishly.\r\n\"I want to get back to civilization and set an excavating party with\r\npickaxes to work on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You take too gloomy a view of the matter. You are a little dusty.\r\nNothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's not only the being buried alive that I mind. I cannot stick\r\nRalph Bingham much longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have found him trying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trying! Why, after I had fallen into that ditch and was coming up for\r\nthe third time, all the man did was simply to call to me to admire an\r\ninfernal iron shot he had just made. No sympathy, mind you! Wrapped up\r\nin himself. Why don't you make your man give up the match? He can't\r\nwin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to admit it. Much may happen between here and Royal Square.\"\r\n\r\nI have seldom known a prophecy more swiftly fulfilled. At this moment\r\nthe doors of the Woodfield Garage opened and a small car rolled out\r\nwith a grimy young man in a sweater at the wheel. He brought the\r\nmachine out into the road, and alighted and went back into the garage,\r\nwhere we heard him shouting unintelligibly to someone in the rear\r\npremises. The car remained puffing and panting against the kerb.\r\n\r\nEngaged in conversation with Rupert Bailey, I was paying little\r\nattention to this evidence of an awakening world, when suddenly I heard\r\na hoarse, triumphant cry from Arthur Jukes, and, turned, I perceived\r\nhis ball dropping neatly into the car's interior. Arthur himself,\r\nbrandishing a niblick, was dancing about in the fairway.\r\n\r\n\"Now what about your moving hazards?\" he cried.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the man in the sweater returned, carrying a spanner.\r\nArthur Jukes sprang towards him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you five pounds to drive me to Royal Square,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI do not know what the sweater-clad young man's engagements for the\r\nmorning had been originally, but nothing could have been more obliging\r\nthan the ready way in which he consented to revise them at a moment's\r\nnotice. I dare say you have noticed that the sturdy peasantry of our\r\nbeloved land respond to an offer of five pounds as to a bugle-call.\r\n\r\n\"You're on,\" said the youth.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Arthur Jukes.\r\n\r\n\"You think you're darned clever,\" said Ralph Bingham.\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Ralph, \"perhaps you will tell us how you propose to\r\nget the ball out of the car when you reach Royal Square?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Arthur. \"You will observe on the side of the\r\nvehicle a convenient handle which, when turned, opens the door. The\r\ndoor thus opened, I shall chip my ball out!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Ralph. \"Yes, I never thought of that.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in the way the man spoke that I did not like. His\r\nmildness seemed to me suspicious. He had the air of a man who has\r\nsomething up his sleeve. I was still musing on this when Arthur called\r\nto me impatiently to get in. I did so, and we drove off. Arthur was in\r\ngreat spirits. He had ascertained from the young man at the wheel that\r\nthere was no chance of the opposition being able to hire another car at\r\nthe garage. This machine was his own property, and the only other one\r\nat present in the shop was suffering from complicated trouble of the\r\noiling-system and would not be able to be moved for at least another\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI, however, shook my head when he pointed out the advantages of his\r\nposition. I was still wondering about Ralph.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Don't like what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ralph Bingham's manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Arthur. \"Nobody does. There have been complaints\r\non all sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, when you told him how you intended to get the ball out of the\r\ncar.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the matter with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was too--ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean he was too--ha?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see the trap he was laying for you. It has just dawned on me. No\r\nwonder he didn't object to your opening the door and chipping the ball\r\nout. By doing so you would forfeit the match.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" I said, \"it is against the rules to tamper with a hazard. If\r\nyou had got into a sand-bunker, would you smooth away the sand? If you\r\nhad put your shot under a tree, could your caddie hold up the branches\r\nto give you a clear shot? Obviously you would disqualify yourself if\r\nyou touched that door.\"\r\n\r\nArthur's jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n\"What! Then how the deuce am I to get it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" I said, gravely, \"is a question between you and your Maker.\"\r\n\r\nIt was here that Arthur Jukes forfeited the sympathy which I had begun\r\nto feel for him. A crafty, sinister look came into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" he said. \"It'll take them an hour to catch up with us.\r\nSuppose, during that time, that door happened to open accidentally, as\r\nit were, and close again? You wouldn't think it necessary to mention\r\nthe fact, eh? You would be a good fellow and keep your mouth shut, yes?\r\nYou might even see your way to go so far as to back me up in a\r\nstatement to the effect that I hooked it out with my----?\"\r\n\r\nI was revolted.\r\n\r\n\"I am a golfer,\" I said, coldly, \"and I obey the rules.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"Those rules were drawn up by----\"--I bared my head reverently--\"by the\r\nCommittee of the Royal and Ancient at St. Andrews. I have always\r\nrespected them, and I shall not deviate on this occasion from the\r\npolicy of a lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nArthur Jukes relapsed into a moody silence. He broke it once, crossing\r\nthe West Street Bridge, to observe that he would like to know if I\r\ncalled myself a friend of his--a question which I was able to answer\r\nwith a whole-hearted negative. After that he did not speak till the car\r\ndrew up in front of the Majestic Hotel in Royal Square.\r\n\r\nEarly as the hour was, a certain bustle and animation already prevailed\r\nin that centre of the city, and the spectacle of a man in a golf-coat\r\nand plus-four knickerbockers hacking with a niblick at the floor of a\r\ncar was not long in collecting a crowd of some dimensions. Three\r\nmessenger-boys, four typists, and a gentleman in full evening-dress,\r\nwho obviously possessed or was friendly with someone who possessed a\r\nlarge cellar, formed the nucleus of it; and they were joined about the\r\ntime when Arthur addressed the ball in order to play his nine hundred\r\nand fifteenth by six news-boys, eleven charladies, and perhaps a dozen\r\nassorted loafers, all speculating with the liveliest interest as to\r\nwhich particular asylum had had the honour of sheltering Arthur before\r\nhe had contrived to elude the vigilance of his custodians.\r\n\r\nArthur had prepared for some such contingency. He suspended his\r\nactivities with the niblick, and drew from his pocket a large poster,\r\nwhich he proceeded to hang over the side of the car. It read:\r\n\r\n    COME\r\n    TO\r\n    McCLURG AND MACDONALD,\r\n    18, WEST STREET,\r\n    FOR\r\n    ALL GOLFING SUPPLIES.\r\n\r\nHis knowledge of psychology had not misled him. Directly they gathered\r\nthat he was advertising something, the crowd declined to look at it;\r\nthey melted away, and Arthur returned to his work in solitude.\r\n\r\nHe was taking a well-earned rest after playing his eleven hundred and\r\nfifth, a nice niblick shot with lots of wrist behind it, when out of\r\nBridle Street there trickled a weary-looking golf-ball, followed in the\r\norder named by Ralph Bingham, resolute but going a trifle at the knees,\r\nand Rupert Bailey on a bicycle. The latter, on whose face and limbs the\r\nmud had dried, made an arresting spectacle.\r\n\r\n\"What are you playing?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Eleven hundred,\" said Rupert. \"We got into a casual dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"A casual dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, just before the bridge. We were coming along nicely, when a stray\r\ndog grabbed our nine hundred and ninety-eighth and took it nearly back\r\nto Woodfield, and we had to start all over again. How are you getting\r\non?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have just played our eleven hundred and fifth. A nice even game.\" I\r\nlooked at Ralph's ball, which was lying close to the kerb. \"You are\r\nfarther from the hole, I think. Your shot, Bingham.\"\r\n\r\nRupert Bailey suggested breakfast. He was a man who was altogether too\r\nfond of creature comforts. He had not the true golfing spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast,\" said Rupert, firmly. \"If you don't know what it is, I can\r\nteach you in half a minute. You play it with a pot of coffee, a knife\r\nand fork, and about a hundred-weight of scrambled eggs. Try it. It's a\r\npastime that grows on you.\"\r\n\r\nI was surprised when Ralph Bingham supported the suggestion. He was so\r\nnear holing out that I should have supposed that nothing would have\r\nkept him from finishing the match. But he agreed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast,\" he said, \"is an excellent idea. You go along in. I'll\r\nfollow in a moment. I want to buy a paper.\"\r\n\r\nWe went into the hotel, and a few minutes later he joined us. Now that\r\nwe were actually at the table, I confess that the idea of breakfast was\r\nby no means repugnant to me. The keen air and the exercise had given me\r\nan appetite, and it was some little time before I was able to assure\r\nthe waiter definitely that he could cease bringing orders of scrambled\r\neggs. The others having finished also, I suggested a move. I was\r\nanxious to get the match over and be free to go home.\r\n\r\nWe filed out of the hotel, Arthur Jukes leading. When I had passed\r\nthrough the swing-doors, I found him gazing perplexedly up and down the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"What has gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"The car!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the car?\" said Ralph Bingham. \"That's all right. Didn't I tell you\r\nabout that? I bought it just now and engaged the driver as my\r\nchauffeur, I've been meaning to buy a car for a long time. A man ought\r\nto have a car.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\" said Arthur, blankly. The man seemed dazed.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't tell you to a mile or two,\" replied Ralph. \"I told the man\r\nto drive to Glasgow. Why? Had you any message for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"But my ball was inside it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that,\" said Ralph, \"is really unfortunate! Do you mean to tell me\r\nyou hadn't managed to get it out yet? Yes, that is a little awkward for\r\nyou. I'm afraid it means that you lose the match.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lose the match?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. The rules are perfectly definite on that point. A period of\r\nfive minutes is allowed for each stroke. The player who fails to make\r\nhis stroke within that time loses the hole. Unfortunate, but there it\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\nArthur Jukes sank down on the path and buried his face in his hands. He\r\nhad the appearance of a broken man. Once more, I am bound to say, I\r\nfelt a certain pity for him. He had certainly struggled gamely, and it\r\nwas hard to be beaten like this on the post.\r\n\r\n\"Playing eleven hundred and one,\" said Ralph Bingham, in his odiously\r\nself-satisfied voice, as he addressed his ball. He laughed jovially. A\r\nmessenger-boy had paused close by and was watching the proceedings\r\ngravely. Ralph Bingham patted him on the head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sonny,\" he said, \"what club would _you_ use here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I claim the match!\" cried Arthur Jukes, springing up. Ralph Bingham\r\nregarded him coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I claim the match!\" repeated Arthur Jukes. \"The rules say that a\r\nplayer who asks advice from any person other than his caddie shall lose\r\nthe hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is absurd!\" said Ralph, but I noticed that he had turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to the judges.\"\r\n\r\n\"We sustain the appeal,\" I said, after a brief consultation with Rupert\r\nBailey. \"The rule is perfectly clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you had lost the match already by not playing within five\r\nminutes,\" said Ralph, vehemently.\r\n\r\n\"It was not my turn to play. You were farther from the pin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, play now. Go on! Let's see you make your shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no necessity,\" said Arthur, frigidly. \"Why should I play when\r\nyou have already disqualified yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I claim a draw!\"\r\n\r\n\"I deny the claim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to the judges.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. We will leave it to the judges.\"\r\n\r\nI consulted with Rupert Bailey. It seemed to me that Arthur Jukes was\r\nentitled to the verdict. Rupert, who, though an amiable and delightful\r\ncompanion, had always been one of Nature's fat-heads, could not see it.\r\nWe had to go back to our principals and announce that we had been\r\nunable to agree.\r\n\r\n\"This is ridiculous,\" said Ralph Bingham. \"We ought to have had a third\r\njudge.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, who should come out of the hotel but Amanda Trivett! A\r\nveritable goddess from the machine.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" I said, \"that you would both be well advised to leave\r\nthe decision to Miss Trivett. You could have no better referee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm game,\" said Arthur Jukes.\r\n\r\n\"Suits _me_,\" said Ralph Bingham.\r\n\r\n\"Why, whatever are you all doing here with your golf-clubs?\" asked the\r\ngirl, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"These two gentlemen,\" I explained, \"have been playing a match, and a\r\npoint has arisen on which the judges do not find themselves in\r\nagreement. We need an unbiased outside opinion, and we should like to\r\nput it up to you. The facts are as follows:...\"\r\n\r\nAmanda Trivett listened attentively, but, when I had finished, she\r\nshook her head.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't know enough about the game to be able to decide a\r\nquestion like that,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Then we must consult St. Andrews,\" said Rupert Bailey.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you who might know,\" said Amanda Trivett, after a moment's\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"My _fiance_. He has just come back from a golfing holiday. That's\r\nwhy I'm in town this morning. I've been to meet him. He is very good at\r\ngolf. He won a medal at Little-Mudbury-in-the-Wold the day before he\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a tense silence. I had the delicacy not to look at Ralph or\r\nArthur. Then the silence was broken by a sharp crack. Ralph Bingham had\r\nbroken his mashie-niblick across his knee. From the direction where\r\nArthur Jukes was standing there came a muffled gulp.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I ask him?\" said Amanda Trivett.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother,\" said Ralph Bingham.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Arthur Jukes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n_The Heel of Achilles_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the young man's face, as he sat sipping his ginger-ale in the\r\nclub-house smoking-room, there was a look of disillusionment. \"Never\r\nagain!\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member glanced up from his paper.\r\n\r\n\"You are proposing to give up golf once more?\" he queried.\r\n\r\n\"Not golf. Betting on golf.\" The Young Man frowned. \"I've just been let\r\ndown badly. Wouldn't you have thought I had a good thing, laying seven\r\nto one on McTavish against Robinson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said the Sage. \"The odds, indeed, generous as they are,\r\nscarcely indicate the former's superiority. Do you mean to tell me that\r\nthe thing came unstitched?\"\r\n\r\n\"Robinson won in a walk, after being three down at the turn.\r\n\r\n\"Strange! What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they looked in at the bar to have a refresher before starting for\r\nthe tenth,\" said the young man, his voice quivering, \"and McTavish\r\nsuddenly discovered that there was a hole in his trouser-pocket and\r\nsixpence had dropped out. He worried so frightfully about it that on\r\nthe second nine he couldn't do a thing right. Went completely off his\r\ngame and didn't win a hole.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sage shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\"If this is really going to be a lesson to you, my boy, never to bet on\r\nthe result of a golf-match, it will be a blessing in disguise. There is\r\nno such thing as a certainty in golf. I wonder if I ever told you a\r\nrather curious episode in the career of Vincent Jopp?\"\r\n\r\n\"_The_ Vincent Jopp? The American multi-millionaire?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same. You never knew he once came within an ace of winning the\r\nAmerican Amateur Championship, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of his playing golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"He played for one season. After that he gave it up and has not touched\r\na club since. Ring the bell and get me a small lime-juice, and I will\r\ntell you all.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was long before your time (said the Oldest Member) that the events\r\nwhich I am about to relate took place. I had just come down from\r\nCambridge, and was feeling particularly pleased with myself because I\r\nhad secured the job of private and confidential secretary to Vincent\r\nJopp, then a man in the early thirties, busy in laying the foundations\r\nof his present remarkable fortune. He engaged me, and took me with him\r\nto Chicago.\r\n\r\nJopp was, I think, the most extraordinary personality I have\r\nencountered in a long and many-sided life. He was admirably equipped\r\nfor success in finance, having the steely eye and square jaw without\r\nwhich it is hopeless for a man to enter that line of business. He\r\npossessed also an overwhelming confidence in himself, and the ability\r\nto switch a cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other without\r\nwiggling his ears, which, as you know, is the stamp of the true Monarch\r\nof the Money Market. He was the nearest approach to the financier on\r\nthe films, the fellow who makes his jaw-muscles jump when he is\r\ntelephoning, that I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nLike all successful men, he was a man of method. He kept a pad on his\r\ndesk on which he would scribble down his appointments, and it was my\r\nduty on entering the office each morning to take this pad and type its\r\ncontents neatly in a loose-leaved ledger. Usually, of course, these\r\nentries referred to business appointments and deals which he was\r\ncontemplating, but one day I was interested to note, against the date\r\nMay 3rd, the entry:\r\n\r\n    \"_Propose to Amelia_\"\r\n\r\nI was interested, as I say, but not surprised. Though a man of steel\r\nand iron, there was nothing of the celibate about Vincent Jopp. He was\r\none of those men who marry early and often. On three separate occasions\r\nbefore I joined his service he had jumped off the dock, to scramble\r\nback to shore again later by means of the Divorce Court lifebelt.\r\nScattered here and there about the country there were three ex-Mrs.\r\nJopps, drawing their monthly envelope, and now, it seemed, he\r\ncontemplated the addition of a fourth to the platoon.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised, I say, at this resolve of his. What did seem a\r\nlittle remarkable to me was the thorough way in which he had thought\r\nthe thing out. This iron-willed man recked nothing of possible\r\nobstacles. Under the date of June 1st was the entry:\r\n\r\n    \"_Marry Amelia_\";\r\n\r\nwhile in March of the following year he had arranged to have his\r\nfirst-born christened Thomas Reginald. Later on, the short-coating of\r\nThomas Reginald was arranged for, and there was a note about sending\r\nhim to school. Many hard things have been said of Vincent Jopp, but\r\nnobody has ever accused him of not being a man who looked ahead.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 4th Jopp came into the office, looking, I\r\nfancied, a little thoughtful. He sat for some moments staring before\r\nhim with his brow a trifle furrowed; then he seemed to come to himself.\r\nHe rapped his desk.\r\n\r\n\"Hi! You!\" he said. It was thus that he habitually addressed me.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jopp?\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"What's golf?\"\r\n\r\nI had at that time just succeeded in getting my handicap down into\r\nsingle figures, and I welcomed the opportunity of dilating on the\r\nnoblest of pastimes. But I had barely begun my eulogy when he stopped\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"It's a game, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you could call it that,\" I said, \"but it is an offhand way\r\nof describing the holiest----\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you play it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well,\" I said. \"At the beginning of the season I didn't seem\r\nable to keep 'em straight at all, but lately I've been doing fine.\r\nGetting better every day. Whether it was that I was moving my head or\r\ngripping too tightly with the right hand----\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep the reminiscences for your grandchildren during the long winter\r\nevenings,\" he interrupted, abruptly, as was his habit. \"What I want to\r\nknow is what a fellow does when he plays golf. Tell me in as few words\r\nas you can just what it's all about.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hit a ball with a stick till it falls into a hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy!\" he snapped. \"Take dictation.\"\r\n\r\nI produced my pad.\r\n\r\n\"May the fifth, take up golf. What's an Amateur Championship?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the annual competition to decide which is the best player among\r\nthe amateurs. There is also a Professional Championship, and an Open\r\nevent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there are golf professionals, are there? What do they do?\"\r\n\r\n\"They teach golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is the best of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sandy McHoots won both British and American Open events last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wire him to come here at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But McHoots is in Inverlochty, in Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. Get him; tell him to name his own terms. When is the\r\nAmateur Championship?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is on September the twelfth this year.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, take dictation. September twelfth win Amateur\r\nChampionship.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him in amazement, but he was not looking at me.\r\n\r\n\"Got that?\" he said. \"September thir--Oh, I was forgetting! Add\r\nSeptember twelfth, corner wheat. September thirteenth, marry Amelia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marry Amelia,\" I echoed, moistening my pencil.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you play this--what's-its-name--golf?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are clubs all over the country. I belong to the Wissahicky\r\nGlen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That a good place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrange today for my becoming a member.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSandy McHoots arrived in due course, and was shown into the private\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. McHoots?\" said Vincent Jopp.\r\n\r\n\"Mphm!\" said the Open Champion.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent for you, Mr. McHoots, because I hear that you are the\r\ngreatest living exponent of this game of golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" said the champion, cordially. \"I am that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to teach me the game. I am already somewhat behind schedule\r\nowing to the delay incident upon your long journey, so let us start at\r\nonce. Name a few of the most important points in connection with the\r\ngame. My secretary will make notes of them, and I will memorize them.\r\nIn this way we shall save time. Now, what is the most important thing\r\nto remember when playing golf?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your heid still.\"\r\n\r\n\"A simple task.\"\r\n\r\n\"Na sae simple as it soonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Vincent Jopp, curtly. \"If I decide to keep my head\r\nstill, I shall keep it still. What next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep yer ee on the ba'.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be attended to. And the next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinna press.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't. And to resume.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McHoots ran through a dozen of the basic rules, and I took them\r\ndown in shorthand. Vincent Jopp studied the list.\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Easier than I had supposed. On the first tee at Wissahicky\r\nGlen at eleven sharp tomorrow, Mr. McHoots. Hi! You!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Go out and buy me a set of clubs, a red jacket, a cloth cap, a pair of\r\nspiked shoes, and a ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"One ball?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. What need is there of more?\"\r\n\r\n\"It sometimes happens,\" I explained, \"that a player who is learning the\r\ngame fails to hit his ball straight, and then he often loses it in the\r\nrough at the side of the fairway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Absurd!\" said Vincent Jopp. \"If I set out to drive my ball straight, I\r\nshall drive it straight. Good morning, Mr. McHoots. You will excuse me\r\nnow. I am busy cornering Woven Textiles.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGolf is in its essence a simple game. You laugh in a sharp, bitter,\r\nbarking manner when I say this, but nevertheless it is true. Where the\r\naverage man goes wrong is in making the game difficult for himself.\r\nObserve the non-player, the man who walks round with you for the sake\r\nof the fresh air. He will hole out with a single care-free flick of his\r\numbrella the twenty-foot putt over which you would ponder and hesitate\r\nfor a full minute before sending it right off the line. Put a driver in\r\nhis hands and he pastes the ball into the next county without a\r\nthought. It is only when he takes to the game in earnest that he\r\nbecomes self-conscious and anxious, and tops his shots even as you and\r\nI. A man who could retain through his golfing career the almost\r\nscornful confidence of the non-player would be unbeatable. Fortunately\r\nsuch an attitude of mind is beyond the scope of human nature.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, beyond the scope of Vincent Jopp, the superman.\r\nVincent Jopp, was, I am inclined to think, the only golfer who ever\r\napproached the game in a spirit of Pure Reason. I have read of men who,\r\nnever having swum in their lives, studied a text-book on their way down\r\nto the swimming bath, mastered its contents, and dived in and won the\r\nbig race. In just such a spirit did Vincent Jopp start to play golf. He\r\ncommitted McHoots's hints to memory, and then went out on the links and\r\nput them into practice. He came to the tee with a clear picture in his\r\nmind of what he had to do, and he did it. He was not intimidated, like\r\nthe average novice, by the thought that if he pulled in his hands he\r\nwould slice, or if he gripped too tightly with the right he would pull.\r\nPulling in the hands was an error, so he did not pull in his hands.\r\nGripping too tightly was a defect, so he did not grip too tightly. With\r\nthat weird concentration which had served him so well in business he\r\ndid precisely what he had set out to do--no less and no more. Golf with\r\nVincent Jopp was an exact science.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the game are studded with the names of those who have\r\nmade rapid progress in their first season. Colonel Quill, we read in\r\nour Vardon, took up golf at the age of fifty-six, and by devising an\r\ningenious machine consisting of a fishing-line and a sawn-down bedpost\r\nwas enabled to keep his head so still that he became a scratch player\r\nbefore the end of the year. But no one, I imagine, except Vincent Jopp,\r\nhas ever achieved scratch on his first morning on the links.\r\n\r\nThe main difference, we are told, between the amateur and the\r\nprofessional golfer is the fact that the latter is always aiming at the\r\npin, while the former has in his mind a vague picture of getting\r\nsomewhere reasonably near it. Vincent Jopp invariably went for the pin.\r\nHe tried to hole out from anywhere inside two hundred and twenty yards.\r\nThe only occasion on which I ever heard him express any chagrin or\r\ndisappointment was during the afternoon round on his first day out,\r\nwhen from the tee on the two hundred and eighty yard seventh he laid\r\nhis ball within six inches of the hole.\r\n\r\n\"A marvellous shot!\" I cried, genuinely stirred.\r\n\r\n\"Too much to the right,\" said Vincent Jopp, frowning.\r\n\r\nHe went on from triumph to triumph. He won the monthly medal in May,\r\nJune, July, August, and September. Towards the end of May he was heard\r\nto complain that Wissahicky Glen was not a sporting course. The Greens\r\nCommittee sat up night after night trying to adjust his handicap so as\r\nto give other members an outside chance against him. The golf experts\r\nof the daily papers wrote columns about his play. And it was pretty\r\ngenerally considered throughout the country that it would be a pure\r\nformality for anyone else to enter against him in the Amateur\r\nChampionship--an opinion which was borne out when he got through into\r\nthe final without losing a hole. A safe man to have betted on, you\r\nwould have said. But mark the sequel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe American Amateur Championship was held that year in Detroit. I had\r\naccompanied my employer there; for, though engaged on this\r\nnerve-wearing contest, he refused to allow his business to be\r\ninterfered with. As he had indicated in his schedule, he was busy at\r\nthe time cornering wheat; and it was my task to combine the duties of\r\ncaddy and secretary. Each day I accompanied him round the links with my\r\nnote-book and his bag of clubs, and the progress of his various matches\r\nwas somewhat complicated by the arrival of a stream of telegraph-boys\r\nbearing important messages. He would read these between the strokes and\r\ndictate replies to me, never, however, taking more than the five\r\nminutes allowed by the rules for an interval between strokes. I am\r\ninclined to think that it was this that put the finishing touch on his\r\nopponents' discomfiture. It is not soothing for a nervous man to have\r\nthe game hung up on the green while his adversary dictates to his caddy\r\na letter beginning \"Yours of the 11th inst. received and contents\r\nnoted. In reply would state----\" This sort of thing puts a man off his\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nI was resting in the lobby of our hotel after a strenuous day's work,\r\nwhen I found that I was being paged. I answered the summons, and was\r\ninformed that a lady wished to see me. Her card bore the name \"Miss\r\nAmelia Merridew.\" Amelia! The name seemed familiar. Then I remembered.\r\nAmelia was the name of the girl Vincent Jopp intended to marry, the\r\nfourth of the long line of Mrs. Jopps. I hurried to present myself, and\r\nfound a tall, slim girl, who was plainly labouring under a considerable\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Merridew?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she murmured. \"My name will be strange to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I right,\" I queried, \"in supposing that you are the lady to whom\r\nMr. Jopp----\"\r\n\r\n\"I am! I am!\" she replied. \"And, oh, what shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindly give me particulars,\" I said, taking out my pad from force of\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment, as if afraid to speak.\r\n\r\n\"You are caddying for Mr. Jopp in the Final tomorrow?\" she said at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then could you--would you mind--would it be giving you too much\r\ntrouble if I asked you to shout 'Boo!' at him when he is making his\r\nstroke, if he looks like winning?\"\r\n\r\nI was perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that I must tell you all. I am sure you will treat what I say as\r\nabsolutely confidential.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am provisionally engaged to Mr. Jopp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Provisionally?\"\r\n\r\nShe gulped.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you my story. Mr. Jopp asked me to marry him, and I would\r\nrather do anything on earth than marry him. But how could I say 'No!'\r\nwith those awful eyes of his boring me through? I knew that if I said\r\n'No', he would argue me out of it in two minutes. I had an idea. I\r\ngathered that he had never played golf, so I told him that I would\r\nmarry him if he won the Amateur Championship this year. And now I find\r\nthat he has been a golfer all along, and, what is more, a plus man! It\r\nisn't fair!\"\r\n\r\n\"He was not a golfer when you made that condition,\" I said. \"He took up\r\nthe game on the following day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! How could he have become as good as he is in this short\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he is Vincent Jopp! In his lexicon there is no such word as\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"What a man! But I can't marry him,\" she cried. \"I want to marry\r\nsomebody else. Oh, won't you help me? Do shout 'Boo!' at him when he is\r\nstarting his down-swing!\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"It would take more than a single 'boo' to put Vincent Jopp off his\r\nstroke.\"\r\n\r\n\"But won't you try it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot. My duty is to my employer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. Duty is duty, and paramount with me. Besides, I have a bet on\r\nhim to win.\"\r\n\r\nThe stricken girl uttered a faint moan, and tottered away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was in our suite shortly after dinner that night, going over some of\r\nthe notes I had made that day, when the telephone rang. Jopp was out at\r\nthe time, taking a short stroll with his after-dinner cigar. I unhooked\r\nthe receiver, and a female voice spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Is that Mr. Jopp?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jopp's secretary speaking. Mr. Jopp is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing important. Will you say that Mrs. Luella Mainprice\r\nJopp called up to wish him luck? I shall be on the course tomorrow to\r\nsee him win the final.\"\r\n\r\nI returned to my notes. Soon afterwards the telephone rang again.\r\n\r\n\"Vincent, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jopp's secretary speaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, will you say that Mrs. Jane Jukes Jopp called up to wish him luck?\r\nI shall be there tomorrow to see him play.\"\r\n\r\nI resumed my work. I had hardly started when the telephone rang for the\r\nthird time.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jopp?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jopp's secretary speaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Mrs. Agnes Parsons Jopp. I just called up to wish him luck. I\r\nshall be looking on tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nI shifted my work nearer to the telephone-table so as to be ready for\r\nthe next call. I had heard that Vincent Jopp had only been married\r\nthree times, but you never knew.\r\n\r\nPresently Jopp came in.\r\n\r\n\"Anybody called up?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody on business. An assortment of your wives were on the wire\r\nwishing you luck. They asked me to say that they will be on the course\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment it seemed to me that the man's iron repose was shaken.\r\n\r\n\"Luella?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"She was the first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"And Jane.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Agnes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Agnes,\" I said, \"is right.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" said Vincent Jopp. And for the first time since I had known him\r\nI thought that he was ill at ease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day of the final dawned bright and clear. At least, I was not awake\r\nat the time to see, but I suppose it did; for at nine o'clock, when I\r\ncame down to breakfast, the sun was shining brightly. The first\r\neighteen holes were to be played before lunch, starting at eleven.\r\nUntil twenty minutes before the hour Vincent Jopp kept me busy taking\r\ndictation, partly on matters connected with his wheat deal and partly\r\non a signed article dealing with the Final, entitled \"How I Won.\" At\r\neleven sharp we were out on the first tee.\r\n\r\nJopp's opponent was a nice-looking young man, but obviously nervous. He\r\ngiggled in a distraught sort of way as he shook hands with my employer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, may the best man win,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I have arranged to do so,\" replied Jopp, curtly, and started to\r\naddress his ball.\r\n\r\nThere was a large crowd at the tee, and, as Jopp started his\r\ndown-swing, from somewhere on the outskirts of this crowd there came\r\nsuddenly a musical \"Boo!\" It rang out in the clear morning air like a\r\nbugle.\r\n\r\nI had been right in my estimate of Vincent Jopp. His forceful stroke\r\nnever wavered. The head of his club struck the ball, despatching it a\r\ngood two hundred yards down the middle of the fairway. As we left the\r\ntee I saw Amelia Merridew being led away with bowed head by two members\r\nof the Greens Committee. Poor girl! My heart bled for her. And yet,\r\nafter all, Fate had been kind in removing her from the scene, even in\r\ncustody, for she could hardly have borne to watch the proceedings.\r\nVincent Jopp made rings round his antagonist. Hole after hole he won in\r\nhis remorseless, machine-like way, until when lunch-time came at the\r\nend of the eighteenth he was ten up. All the other holes had been\r\nhalved.\r\n\r\nIt was after lunch, as we made our way to the first tee, that the\r\nadvance-guard of the Mrs. Jopps appeared in the person of Luella\r\nMainprice Jopp, a kittenish little woman with blond hair and a\r\nPekingese dog. I remembered reading in the papers that she had divorced\r\nmy employer for persistent and aggravated mental cruelty, calling\r\nwitnesses to bear out her statement that he had said he did not like\r\nher in pink, and that on two separate occasions had insisted on her dog\r\neating the leg of a chicken instead of the breast; but Time, the great\r\nhealer, seemed to have removed all bitterness, and she greeted him\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\"Wassums going to win great big championship against nasty rough strong\r\nman?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Such,\" said Vincent Jopp, \"is my intention. It was kind of you,\r\nLuella, to trouble to come and watch me. I wonder if you know Mrs.\r\nAgnes Parsons Jopp?\" he said, courteously, indicating a kind-looking,\r\nmotherly woman who had just come up. \"How are you, Agnes?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had asked me that question this morning, Vincent,\" replied Mrs.\r\nAgnes Parsons Jopp, \"I should have been obliged to say that I felt far\r\nfrom well. I had an odd throbbing feeling in the left elbow, and I am\r\nsure my temperature was above the normal. But this afternoon I am a\r\nlittle better. How are you, Vincent?\"\r\n\r\nAlthough she had, as I recalled from the reports of the case, been\r\ncompelled some years earlier to request the Court to sever her marital\r\nrelations with Vincent Jopp on the ground of calculated and inhuman\r\nbrutality, in that he had callously refused, in spite of her pleadings,\r\nto take old Dr. Bennett's Tonic Swamp-Juice three times a day, her\r\nvoice, as she spoke, was kind and even anxious. Badly as this man had\r\ntreated her--and I remember hearing that several of the jury had been\r\nunable to restrain their tears when she was in the witness-box giving\r\nher evidence--there still seemed to linger some remnants of the old\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite well, thank you, Agnes,\" said Vincent Jopp.\r\n\r\n\"Are you wearing your liver-pad?\"\r\n\r\nA frown flitted across my employer's strong face.\r\n\r\n\"I am not wearing my liver-pad,\" he replied, brusquely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Vincent, how rash of you!\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to speak, when a sudden exclamation from his rear checked\r\nhim. A genial-looking woman in a sports coat was standing there, eyeing\r\nhim with a sort of humorous horror.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jane,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI gathered that this was Mrs. Jane Jukes Jopp, the wife who had\r\ndivorced him for systematic and ingrowing fiendishness on the ground\r\nthat he had repeatedly outraged her feelings by wearing a white\r\nwaistcoat with a dinner-jacket. She continued to look at him dumbly,\r\nand then uttered a sort of strangled, hysterical laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Those legs!\" she cried. \"Those legs!\"\r\n\r\nVincent Jopp flushed darkly. Even the strongest and most silent of us\r\nhave our weaknesses, and my employer's was the rooted idea that he\r\nlooked well in knickerbockers. It was not my place to try to dissuade\r\nhim, but there was no doubt that they did not suit him. Nature, in\r\nbestowing upon him a massive head and a jutting chin, had forgotten to\r\nfinish him off at the other end. Vincent Jopp's legs were skinny.\r\n\r\n\"You poor dear man!\" went on Mrs. Jane Jukes Jopp. \"What practical\r\njoker ever lured you into appearing in public in knickerbockers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't object to the knickerbockers,\" said Mrs. Agnes Parsons Jopp,\r\n\"but when he foolishly comes out in quite a strong east wind without\r\nhis liver-pad----\"\r\n\r\n\"Little Tinky-Ting don't need no liver-pad, he don't,\" said Mrs. Luella\r\nMainprice Jopp, addressing the animal in her arms, \"because he was his\r\nmuzzer's pet, he was.\"\r\n\r\nI was standing quite near to Vincent Jopp, and at this moment I saw a\r\nbead of perspiration spring out on his forehead, and into his steely\r\neyes there came a positively hunted look. I could understand and\r\nsympathize. Napoleon himself would have wilted if he had found himself\r\nin the midst of a trio of females, one talking baby-talk, another\r\nfussing about his health, and the third making derogatory observations\r\non his lower limbs. Vincent Jopp was becoming unstrung.\r\n\r\n\"May as well be starting, shall we?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Jopp's opponent who spoke. There was a strange, set look on his\r\nface--the look of a man whose back is against the wall. Ten down on the\r\nmorning's round, he had drawn on his reserves of courage and was\r\ndetermined to meet the inevitable bravely.\r\n\r\nVincent Jopp nodded absently, then turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"Keep those women away from me,\" he whispered tensely. \"They'll put me\r\noff my stroke!\"\r\n\r\n\"Put _you_ off your stroke!\" I exclaimed, incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, me! How the deuce can I concentrate, with people babbling about\r\nliver-pads, and--and knickerbockers all round me? Keep them away!\"\r\n\r\nHe started to address his ball, and there was a weak uncertainty in the\r\nway he did it that prepared me for what was to come. His club rose,\r\nwavered, fell; and the ball, badly topped, trickled two feet and sank\r\ninto a cuppy lie.\r\n\r\n\"Is that good or bad?\" inquired Mrs. Luella Mainprice Jopp.\r\n\r\nA sort of desperate hope gleamed in the eye of the other competitor in\r\nthe final. He swung with renewed vigour. His ball sang through the air,\r\nand lay within chip-shot distance of the green.\r\n\r\n\"At the very least,\" said Mrs. Agnes Parsons Jopp, \"I hope, Vincent,\r\nthat you are wearing flannel next your skin.\"\r\n\r\nI heard Jopp give a stifled groan as he took his spoon from the bag. He\r\nmade a gallant effort to retrieve the lost ground, but the ball struck\r\na stone and bounded away into the long grass to the side of the green.\r\nHis opponent won the hole.\r\n\r\nWe moved to the second tee.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that young man,\" said Mrs. Jane Jukes Jopp, indicating her late\r\nhusband's blushing antagonist, \"is quite right to wear knickerbockers.\r\nHe can carry them off. But a glance in the mirror must have shown you\r\nthat you----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you're feverish, Vincent,\" said Mrs. Agnes Parsons Jopp,\r\nsolicitously. \"You are quite flushed. There is a wild gleam in your\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Muzzer's pet got little buttons of eyes, that don't never have no wild\r\ngleam in zem because he's muzzer's own darling, he was!\" said Mrs.\r\nLuella Mainprice Jopp.\r\n\r\nA hollow groan escaped Vincent Jopp's ashen lips.\r\n\r\nI need not recount the play hole by hole, I think. There are some\r\nsubjects that are too painful. It was pitiful to watch Vincent Jopp in\r\nhis downfall. By the end of the first nine his lead had been reduced to\r\none, and his antagonist, rendered a new man by success, was playing\r\nmagnificent golf. On the next hole he drew level. Then with a\r\nsuperhuman effort Jopp contrived to halve the eleventh, twelfth, and\r\nthirteenth. It seemed as though his iron will might still assert\r\nitself, but on the fourteenth the end came.\r\n\r\nHe had driven a superb ball, outdistancing his opponent by a full fifty\r\nyards. The latter played a good second to within a few feet of the\r\ngreen. And then, as Vincent Jopp was shaping for his stroke, Luella\r\nMainprice gave tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Vincent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vincent, that other man--bad man--not playing fair. When your back was\r\nturned just now, he gave his ball a great bang. _I_ was watching\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" said Mrs. Agnes Parsons Jopp, \"I do hope, when the game\r\nis over, Vincent, that you will remember to cool slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flesho!\" cried Mrs. Jane Jukes Jopp triumphantly. \"I've been trying to\r\nremember the name all the afternoon. I saw about it in one of the\r\npapers. The advertisements speak most highly of it. You take it before\r\nbreakfast and again before retiring, and they guarantee it to produce\r\nfirm, healthy flesh on the most sparsely-covered limbs in next to no\r\ntime. Now, _will_ you remember to get a bottle tonight? It comes\r\nin two sizes, the five-shilling (or large size) and the smaller at\r\nhalf-a-crown. G. K. Chesterton writes that he used it regularly for\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nVincent Jopp uttered a quavering moan, and his hand, as he took the\r\nmashie from his bag, was trembling like an aspen.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, he was on his way back to the club-house, a beaten\r\nman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so (concluded the Oldest Member) you see that in golf there is no\r\nsuch thing as a soft snap. You can never be certain of the finest\r\nplayer. Anything may happen to the greatest expert at any stage of the\r\ngame. In a recent competition George Duncan took eleven shots over a\r\nhole which eighteen-handicap men generally do in five. No! Back horses\r\nor go down to Throgmorton Street and try to take it away from the\r\nRothschilds, and I will applaud you as a shrewd and cautious financier.\r\nBut to bet at golf is pure gambling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n_The Rough Stuff_\r\n\r\n\r\nInto the basking warmth of the day there had crept, with the approach\r\nof evening, that heartening crispness which heralds the advent of\r\nautumn. Already, in the valley by the ninth tee, some of the trees had\r\nbegun to try on strange colours, in tentative experiment against the\r\ncoming of nature's annual fancy dress ball, when the soberest tree\r\ncasts off its workaday suit of green and plunges into a riot of reds\r\nand yellows. On the terrace in front of the club-house an occasional\r\nwithered leaf fluttered down on the table where the Oldest Member sat,\r\nsipping a thoughtful seltzer and lemon and listening with courteous\r\ngravity to a young man in a sweater and golf breeches who occupied the\r\nneighbouring chair.\r\n\r\n\"She is a dear girl,\" said the young man a little moodily, \"a dear girl\r\nin every respect. But somehow--I don't know--when I see her playing\r\ngolf I can't help thinking that woman's place is in the home.\"\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member inclined his frosted head.\r\n\r\n\"You think,\" he said, \"that lovely woman loses in queenly dignity when\r\nshe fails to slam the ball squarely on the meat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind her missing the pill,\" said the young man. \"But I think\r\nher attitude toward the game is too light-hearted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it cloaks a deeper feeling. One of the noblest women I ever\r\nknew used to laugh merrily when she foozled a short putt. It was only\r\nlater, when I learned that in the privacy of her home she would weep\r\nbitterly and bite holes in the sofa cushions, that I realized that she\r\ndid but wear the mask. Continue to encourage your _fiancee_ to\r\nplay the game, my boy. Much happiness will reward you. I could tell you\r\na story----\"\r\n\r\nA young woman of singular beauty and rather statuesque appearance came\r\nout of the club-house carrying a baby swaddled in flannel. As she drew\r\nnear the table she said to the baby:\r\n\r\n\"Chicketty wicketty wicketty wipsey pop!\"\r\n\r\nIn other respects her intelligence appeared to be above the ordinary.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't he a darling!\" she said, addressing the Oldest Member.\r\n\r\nThe Sage cast a meditative eye upon the infant. Except to the eye of\r\nlove, it looked like a skinned poached egg.\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably so,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think he looks more like his father every day?\"\r\n\r\nFor a brief instant the Oldest Member seemed to hesitate.\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly!\" he said. \"Is your husband out on the links today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not today. He had to see Wilberforce off on the train to Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your brother is going to Scotland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Ramsden has such a high opinion of the schools up there. I did\r\nsay that Scotland was a long way off, and he said yes, that had\r\noccurred to him, but that we must make sacrifices for Willie's good. He\r\nwas very brave and cheerful about it. Well, I mustn't stay. There's\r\nquite a nip in the air, and Rammikins will get a nasty cold in his\r\nprecious little button of a nose if I don't walk him about. Say\r\n'Bye-bye' to the gentleman, Rammy!\"\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Member watched her go thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"There is a nip in the air,\" he said, \"and, unlike our late\r\nacquaintance in the flannel, I am not in my first youth. Come with me,\r\nI want to show you something.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way into the club-house, and paused before the wall of the\r\nsmoking-room. This was decorated from top to bottom with bold\r\ncaricatures of members of the club.\r\n\r\n\"These,\" he said, \"are the work of a young newspaper artist who belongs\r\nhere. A clever fellow. He has caught the expressions of these men\r\nwonderfully. His only failure, indeed, is that picture of myself.\" He\r\nregarded it with distaste, and a touch of asperity crept into his\r\nmanner. \"I don't know why the committee lets it stay there,\" he said,\r\nirritably. \"It isn't a bit like.\" He recovered himself. \"But all the\r\nothers are excellent, excellent, though I believe many of the subjects\r\nare under the erroneous impression that they bear no resemblance to the\r\noriginals. Here is the picture I wished to show you. That is Ramsden\r\nWaters, the husband of the lady who has just left us.\"\r\n\r\nThe portrait which he indicated was that of a man in the early\r\nthirties. Pale saffron hair surmounted a receding forehead. Pale blue\r\neyes looked out over a mouth which wore a pale, weak smile, from the\r\ncentre of which protruded two teeth of a rabbit-like character.\r\n\r\n\"Golly! What a map!\" exclaimed the young man at his side.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely!\" said the Oldest Member. \"You now understand my momentary\r\nhesitation in agreeing with Mrs. Waters that the baby was like its\r\nfather. I was torn by conflicting emotions. On the one hand, politeness\r\ndemanded that I confirm any statement made by a lady. Common humanity,\r\non the other hand, made it repugnant to me to knock an innocent child.\r\nYes, that is Ramsden Waters. Sit down and take the weight off your\r\nfeet, and I will tell you about him. The story illustrates a favourite\r\ntheory of mine, that it is an excellent thing that women should be\r\nencouraged to take up golf. There are, I admit, certain drawbacks\r\nattendant on their presence on the links. I shall not readily forget\r\nthe occasion on which a low, raking drive of mine at the eleventh\r\nstruck the ladies' tee box squarely and came back and stunned my\r\ncaddie, causing me to lose stroke and distance. Nevertheless, I hold\r\nthat the advantages outnumber the drawbacks. Golf humanizes women,\r\nhumbles their haughty natures, tends, in short, to knock out of their\r\nsystems a certain modicum of that superciliousness, that swank, which\r\nmakes wooing a tough proposition for the diffident male. You may have\r\nfound this yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as a matter of fact,\" admitted the young man, \"now I come to\r\nthink of it I have noticed that Genevieve has shown me a bit more\r\nrespect since she took up the game. When I drive 230 yards after she\r\nhad taken six sloshes to cover fifty, I sometimes think that a new\r\nlight comes into her eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said the Sage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom earliest youth (said the Oldest Member) Ramsden Waters had always\r\nbeen of a shrinking nature. He seemed permanently scared. Possibly his\r\nnurse had frightened him with tales of horror in his babyhood. If so,\r\nshe must have been the Edgar Allan Poe of her sex, for, by the time he\r\nreached men's estate, Ramsden Waters had about as much ferocity and\r\nself-assertion as a blanc mange. Even with other men he was noticeably\r\ntimid, and with women he comported himself in a manner that roused\r\ntheir immediate scorn and antagonism. He was one of those men who fall\r\nover their feet and start apologizing for themselves the moment they\r\nsee a woman. His idea of conversing with a girl was to perspire and tie\r\nhimself into knots, making the while a strange gurgling sound like the\r\nlanguage of some primitive tribe. If ever a remark of any coherence\r\nemerged from his tangled vocal cords it dealt with the weather, and he\r\nimmediately apologized and qualified it. To such a man women are\r\nmerciless, and it speedily became an article of faith with the feminine\r\npopulation of this locality that Ramsden Waters was an unfortunate\r\nincident and did not belong. Finally, after struggling for a time to\r\nkeep up a connection in social circles, he gave it up and became a sort\r\nof hermit.\r\n\r\nI think that caricature I just showed you weighed rather heavily on the\r\npoor fellow. Just as he was nerving himself to make another attempt to\r\nenter society, he would catch sight of it and say to himself, \"What\r\nhope is there for a man with a face like that?\" These caricaturists are\r\ntoo ready to wound people simply in order to raise a laugh. Personally\r\nI am broad-minded enough to smile at that portrait of myself. It has\r\ngiven me great enjoyment, though why the committee permits it to--But\r\nthen, of course, it isn't a bit like, whereas that of Ramsden Waters\r\nnot only gave the man's exact appearance, very little exaggerated, but\r\nlaid bare his very soul. That portrait is the portrait of a chump, and\r\nsuch Ramsden Waters undeniably was.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the first year in the neighbourhood, Ramsden, as I say,\r\nhad become practically a hermit. He lived all by himself in a house\r\nnear the fifteenth green, seeing nobody, going nowhere. His only solace\r\nwas golf. His late father had given him an excellent education, and,\r\neven as early as his seventeenth year, I believe, he was going round\r\ndifficult courses in par. Yet even this admirable gift, which might\r\nhave done him social service, was rendered negligible by the fact that\r\nhe was too shy and shrinking to play often with other men. As a rule,\r\nhe confined himself to golfing by himself in the mornings and late\r\nevenings when the links were more or less deserted. Yes, in his\r\ntwenty-ninth year, Ramsden Waters had sunk to the depth of becoming a\r\nsecret golfer.\r\n\r\nOne lovely morning in summer, a scented morning of green and blue and\r\ngold, when the birds sang in the trees and the air had that limpid\r\nclearness which makes the first hole look about 100 yards long instead\r\nof 345, Ramsden Waters, alone as ever, stood on the first tee\r\naddressing his ball. For a space he waggled masterfully, then, drawing\r\nhis club back with a crisp swish, brought it down. And, as he did so, a\r\nvoice behind him cried:\r\n\r\n\"Bing!\"\r\n\r\nRamsden's driver wabbled at the last moment. The ball flopped weakly\r\namong the trees on the right of the course. Ramsden turned to perceive,\r\nstanding close beside him, a small fat boy in a sailor suit. There was\r\na pause.\r\n\r\n\"Rotten!\" said the boy austerely.\r\n\r\nRamsden gulped. And then suddenly he saw that the boy was not alone.\r\nAbout a medium approach-putt distance, moving gracefully and languidly\r\ntowards him, was a girl of such pronounced beauty that Ramsden Waters's\r\nheart looped the loop twice in rapid succession. It was the first time\r\nthat he had seen Eunice Bray, and, like most men who saw her for the\r\nfirst time, he experienced the sensations of one in an express lift at\r\nthe tenth floor going down who has left the majority of his internal\r\norgans up on the twenty-second. He felt a dazed emptiness. The world\r\nswam before his eyes.\r\n\r\nYou yourself saw Eunice just now: and, though you are in a sense\r\nimmune, being engaged to a charming girl of your own, I noticed that\r\nyou unconsciously braced yourself up and tried to look twice as\r\nhandsome as nature ever intended you to. You smirked and, if you had a\r\nmoustache, you would have twiddled it. You can imagine, then, the\r\neffect which this vision of loveliness had on lonely, diffident Ramsden\r\nWaters. It got right in amongst him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid my little brother spoiled your stroke,\" said Eunice. She\r\ndid not speak at all apologetically, but rather as a goddess might have\r\nspoken to a swineherd.\r\n\r\nRamsden yammered noiselessly. As always in the presence of the opposite\r\nsex, and more than ever now, his vocal cords appeared to have tied\r\nthemselves in a knot which would have baffled a sailor and might have\r\nperplexed Houdini. He could not even gargle.\r\n\r\n\"He is very fond of watching golf,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\nShe took the boy by the hand, and was about to lead him off, when\r\nRamsden miraculously recovered speech.\r\n\r\n\"Would he like to come round with me?\" he croaked. How he had managed\r\nto acquire the nerve to make the suggestion he could never understand.\r\nI suppose that in certain supreme moments a sort of desperate\r\nrecklessness descends on nervous men.\r\n\r\n\"How very kind of you!\" said the girl indifferently. \"But I'm afraid----\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to go!\" shrilled the boy. \"I want to go!\"\r\n\r\nFond as Eunice Bray was of her little brother, I imagine that the\r\nprospect of having him taken off her hands on a fine summer morning,\r\nwhen all nature urged her to sit in the shade on the terrace and read a\r\nbook, was not unwelcome.\r\n\r\n\"It would be very kind of you if you would let him,\" said Eunice. \"He\r\nwasn't able to go to the circus last week, and it was a great\r\ndisappointment; this will do instead.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned toward the terrace, and Ramsden, his head buzzing, tottered\r\ninto the jungle to find his ball, followed by the boy.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to extract full particulars of that morning's\r\nround from Ramsden. If you speak of it to him, he will wince and change\r\nthe subject. Yet he seems to have had the presence of mind to pump\r\nWilberforce as to the details of his home life, and by the end of the\r\nround he had learned that Eunice and her brother had just come to visit\r\nan aunt who lived in the neighbourhood. Their house was not far from\r\nthe links; Eunice was not engaged to be married; and the aunt made a\r\nhobby of collecting dry seaweed, which she pressed and pasted in an\r\nalbum. One sometimes thinks that aunts live entirely for pleasure.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the round Ramsden staggered on to the terrace, tripping\r\nover his feet, and handed Wilberforce back in good condition. Eunice,\r\nwho had just reached the chapter where the hero decides to give up all\r\nfor love, thanked him perfunctorily without looking up from her book;\r\nand so ended the first spasm of Ramsden Waters's life romance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are few things more tragic than the desire of the moth for the\r\nstar; and it is a curious fact that the spectacle of a star almost\r\ninvariably fills the most sensible moth with thoughts above his\r\nstation. No doubt, if Ramsden Waters had stuck around and waited long\r\nenough there might have come his way in the fullness of time some nice,\r\nhomely girl with a squint and a good disposition who would have been\r\nabout his form. In his modest day dreams he had aspired to nothing\r\nhigher. But the sight of Eunice Bray seemed to have knocked all the\r\nsense out of the man. He must have known that he stood no chance of\r\nbecoming anything to her other than a handy means of getting rid of\r\nlittle Wilberforce now and again. Why, the very instant that Eunice\r\nappeared in the place, every eligible bachelor for miles around her\r\ntossed his head with a loud, snorting sound, and galloped madly in her\r\ndirection. Dashing young devils they were, handsome, well-knit fellows\r\nwith the figures of Greek gods and the faces of movie heroes. Any one\r\nof them could have named his own price from the advertisers of collars.\r\nThey were the sort of young men you see standing grandly beside the\r\nfull-page picture of the seven-seater Magnifico car in the magazines.\r\nAnd it was against this field that Ramsden Waters, the man with the\r\nunshuffled face, dared to pit his feeble personality. One weeps.\r\n\r\nSomething of the magnitude of the task he had undertaken must have come\r\nhome to Ramsden at a very early point in the proceedings. At Eunice's\r\nhome, at the hour when women receive callers, he was from the start a\r\nmere unconsidered unit in the mob scene. While his rivals clustered\r\nthickly about the girl, he was invariably somewhere on the outskirts\r\nlistening limply to the aunt. I imagine that seldom has any young man\r\nhad such golden opportunities of learning all about dried seaweed.\r\nIndeed, by the end of the month Ramsden Waters could not have known\r\nmore about seaweed if he had been a deep sea fish. And yet he was not\r\nhappy. He was in a position, if he had been at a dinner party and\r\nthings had got a bit slow, to have held the table spellbound with the\r\nfirst hand information about dried seaweed, straight from the stable;\r\nyet nevertheless he chafed. His soul writhed and sickened within him.\r\nHe lost weight and went right off his approach shots. I confess that my\r\nheart bled for the man.\r\n\r\nHis only consolation was that nobody else, not even the fellows who\r\nworked their way right through the jam and got seats in the front row\r\nwhere they could glare into her eyes and hang on her lips and all that\r\nsort of thing, seemed to be making any better progress.\r\n\r\nAnd so matters went on till one day Eunice decided to take up golf. Her\r\nmotive for doing this was, I believe, simply because Kitty Manders, who\r\nhad won a small silver cup at a monthly handicap, receiving thirty-six,\r\nwas always dragging the conversation round to this trophy, and if there\r\nwas one firm article in Eunice Bray's simple creed it was that she\r\nwould be hanged if she let Kitty, who was by way of being a rival on a\r\nsmall scale, put anything over on her. I do not defend Eunice, but\r\nwomen are women, and I doubt if any of them really take up golf in that\r\nholy, quest-of-the-grail spirit which animates men. I have known girls\r\nto become golfers as an excuse for wearing pink jumpers, and one at\r\nleast who did it because she had read in the beauty hints in the\r\nevening paper that it made you lissome. Girls will be girls.\r\n\r\nHer first lessons Eunice received from the professional, but after that\r\nshe saved money by distributing herself among her hordes of admirers,\r\nwho were only too willing to give up good matches to devote themselves\r\nto her tuition. By degrees she acquired a fair skill and a confidence\r\nin her game which was not altogether borne out by results. From Ramsden\r\nWaters she did not demand a lesson. For one thing it never occurred to\r\nher that so poor-spirited a man could be of any use at the game, and\r\nfor another Ramsden was always busy tooling round with little\r\nWilberforce.\r\n\r\nYet it was with Ramsden that she was paired in the first competition\r\nfor which she entered, the annual mixed foursomes. And it was on the\r\nsame evening that the list of the draw went up on the notice board that\r\nRamsden proposed.\r\n\r\nThe mind of a man in love works in strange ways. To you and to me there\r\nwould seem to be no reason why the fact that Eunice's name and his own\r\nhad been drawn out of a hat together should so impress Ramsden, but he\r\nlooked on it as an act of God. It seemed to him to draw them close\r\ntogether, to set up a sort of spiritual affinity. In a word, it acted\r\non the poor fellow like a tonic, and that very night he went around to\r\nher house, and having, after a long and extremely interesting\r\nconversation with her aunt, contrived to get her alone, coughed eleven\r\ntimes in a strangled sort of way, and suggested that the wedding bells\r\nshould ring out.\r\n\r\nEunice was more startled than angry.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I'm tremendously complimented, Mr.----\" She had to pause to\r\nrecall the name. \"Mr.----\"\r\n\r\n\"Waters,\" said Ramsden, humbly.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, yes. Mr. Waters. As I say, it's a great compliment----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"A great compliment----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" murmured Ramsden obsequiously.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't interrupt!\" snapped Eunice with irritation. No\r\ngirl likes to have to keep going back and trying over her speeches.\r\n\"It's a great compliment, but it is quite impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you say, of course,\" agreed Ramsden.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" demanded Eunice, \"have you to offer me? I don't mean money. I\r\nmean something more spiritual. What is there in you, Mr. Walter----\"\r\n\r\n\"Waters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Waters. What is there in you that would repay a girl for giving up\r\nthe priceless boon of freedom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know a lot about dried seaweed,\" suggested Ramsden hopefully.\r\n\r\nEunice shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, \"it is quite impossible. You have paid me the greatest\r\ncompliment a man can pay a woman, Mr. Waterson----\"\r\n\r\n\"Waters,\" said Ramsden. \"I'll write it down for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't trouble. I am afraid we shall never meet again----\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are partners in the mixed foursomes tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, so we are!\" said Eunice. \"Well, mind you play up. I want to\r\nwin a cup more than anything on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Ramsden, \"if only I could win what I want to win more than\r\nanything else on earth! You, I mean,\" he added, to make his meaning\r\nclear. \"If I could win you----\" His tongue tied itself in a bow knot\r\nround his uvula, and he could say no more. He moved slowly to the door,\r\npaused with his fingers on the handle for one last look over his\r\nshoulder, and walked silently into the cupboard where Eunice's aunt\r\nkept her collection of dried seaweed.\r\n\r\nHis second start was favoured with greater luck, and he found himself\r\nout in the hall, and presently in the cool air of the night, with the\r\nstars shining down on him. Had those silent stars ever shone down on a\r\nmore broken-hearted man? Had the cool air of the night ever fanned a\r\nmore fevered brow? Ah, yes! Or, rather, ah no!\r\n\r\nThere was not a very large entry for the mixed foursomes competition.\r\nIn my experience there seldom is. Men are as a rule idealists, and wish\r\nto keep their illusions regarding women intact, and it is difficult for\r\nthe most broad-minded man to preserve a chivalrous veneration for the\r\nsex after a woman has repeatedly sliced into the rough and left him a\r\ndifficult recovery. Women, too--I am not speaking of the occasional\r\nchampions, but of the average woman, the one with the handicap of 33,\r\nwho plays in high-heeled shoes--are apt to giggle when they foozle out\r\nof a perfect lie, and this makes for misogyny. Only eight couples\r\nassembled on the tenth tee (where our foursomes matches start) on the\r\nmorning after Ramsden Waters had proposed to Eunice. Six of these were\r\nnegligible, consisting of males of average skill and young women who\r\nplayed golf because it kept them out in the fresh air. Looking over the\r\nfield, Ramsden felt that the only serious rivalry was to be feared from\r\nMarcella Bingley and her colleague, a 16-handicap youth named George\r\nPerkins, with whom they were paired for the opening round. George was a\r\npretty indifferent performer, but Marcella, a weather-beaten female\r\nwith bobbed hair and the wrists of a welterweight pugilist, had once\r\nappeared in the women's open championship and swung a nasty iron.\r\n\r\nRamsden watched her drive a nice, clean shot down the middle of the\r\nfairway, and spoke earnestly to Eunice. His heart was in this\r\ncompetition, for, though the first prize in the mixed foursomes does\r\nnot perhaps entitle the winners to a place in the hall of fame, Ramsden\r\nhad the soul of the true golfer. And the true golfer wants to win\r\nwhenever he starts, whether he is playing in a friendly round or in the\r\nopen championship.\r\n\r\n\"What we've got to do is to play steadily,\" he said. \"Don't try any\r\nfancy shots. Go for safety. Miss Bingley is a tough proposition, but\r\nGeorge Perkins is sure to foozle a few, and if we play safe we've got\r\n'em cold. The others don't count.\"\r\n\r\nYou notice something odd about this speech. Something in it strikes you\r\nas curious. Precisely. It affected Eunice Bray in the same fashion. In\r\nthe first place, it contains forty-four words, some of them of two\r\nsyllables, others of even greater length. In the second place, it was\r\nspoken crisply, almost commandingly, without any of that hesitation and\r\nstammering which usually characterized Ramsden Waters's utterances.\r\nEunice was puzzled. She was also faintly resentful. True, there was not\r\na word in what he had said that was calculated to bring the blush of\r\nshame to the cheek of modesty; nevertheless, she felt vaguely that\r\nRamsden Waters had exceeded the limits. She had been prepared for a\r\ngurgling Ramsden Waters, a Ramsden Waters who fell over his large feet\r\nand perspired; but here was a Ramsden Waters who addressed her not\r\nmerely as an equal, but with more than a touch of superiority. She eyed\r\nhim coldly, but he had turned to speak to little Wilberforce, who was\r\nto accompany them on the round.\r\n\r\n\"And you, my lad,\" said Ramsden curtly, \"you kindly remember that this\r\nis a competition, and keep your merry flow of conversation as much as\r\npossible to yourself. You've got a bad habit of breaking into small\r\ntalk when a man's addressing the ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think that my brother will be in the way----\" began Eunice\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind him coming round,\" said Ramsden, \"if he keeps quiet.\"\r\n\r\nEunice gasped. She had not played enough golf to understand how that\r\nnoblest of games changes a man's whole nature when on the links. She\r\nwas thinking of something crushing to say to him, when he advanced to\r\nthe tee to drive off.\r\n\r\nHe drove a perfect ball, hard and low with a lot of roll. Even Eunice\r\nwas impressed.\r\n\r\n\"Good shot, partner!\" she said.\r\n\r\nRamsden was apparently unaware that she had spoken. He was gazing down\r\nthe fairway with his club over his left shoulder in an attitude almost\r\nidentical with that of Sandy McBean in the plate labelled \"The\r\nDrive--Correct Finish\", to face page twenty-four of his monumental\r\nwork, \"How to Become a Scratch Player Your First Season by Studying\r\nPhotographs\". Eunice bit her lip. She was piqued. She felt as if she\r\nhad patted the head of a pet lamb, and the lamb had turned and bitten\r\nher in the finger.\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'Good shot, partner!'\" she repeated coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ramsden, \"but don't talk. It prevents one concentrating.\"\r\nHe turned to Wilberforce. \"And don't let me have to tell you that\r\nagain!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Wilberforce has been like a mouse!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I complain of,\" said Ramsden. \"Mice make a beastly\r\nscratching sound, and that's what he was doing when I drove that ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was only playing with the sand in the tee box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he does it again, I shall be reluctantly compelled to take\r\nsteps.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked in silence to where the ball had stopped. It was nicely\r\nperched up on the grass, and to have plunked it on to the green with an\r\niron should have been for any reasonable golfer the work of a moment.\r\nEunice, however, only succeeded in slicing it feebly into the rough.\r\n\r\nRamsden reached for his niblick and plunged into the bushes. And,\r\npresently, as if it had been shot up by some convulsion of nature, the\r\nball, accompanied on the early stages of its journey by about a pound\r\nof mixed mud, grass, and pebbles, soared through the air and fell on\r\nthe green. But the mischief had been done. Miss Bingley, putting\r\nforcefully, put the opposition ball down for a four and won the hole.\r\n\r\nEunice now began to play better, and, as Ramsden was on the top of his\r\ngame, a ding-dong race ensued for the remainder of the first nine\r\nholes. The Bingley-Perkins combination, owing to some inspired work by\r\nthe female of the species, managed to keep their lead up to the tricky\r\nravine hole, but there George Perkins, as might have been expected of\r\nhim, deposited the ball right in among the rocks, and Ramsden and\r\nEunice drew level. The next four holes were halved and they reached the\r\nclub-house with no advantage to either side. Here there was a pause\r\nwhile Miss Bingley went to the professional's shop to have a tack put\r\ninto the leather of her mashie, which had worked loose. George Perkins\r\nand little Wilberforce, who believed in keeping up their strength,\r\nmelted silently away in the direction of the refreshment bar, and\r\nRamsden and Eunice were alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pique which Eunice had felt at the beginning of the game had\r\nvanished by now. She was feeling extremely pleased with her performance\r\non the last few holes, and would have been glad to go into the matter\r\nfully. Also, she was conscious of a feeling not perhaps of respect so\r\nmuch as condescending tolerance towards Ramsden. He might be a pretty\r\nminus quantity in a drawing-room or at a dance, but in a bunker or out\r\nin the open with a cleek, Eunice felt, you'd be surprised. She was just\r\nabout to address him in a spirit of kindliness, when he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Better keep your brassey in the bag on the next nine,\" he said. \"Stick\r\nto the iron. The great thing is to keep 'em straight!\"\r\n\r\nEunice gasped. Indeed, had she been of a less remarkable beauty one\r\nwould have said that she snorted. The sky turned black, and all her\r\namiability was swept away in a flood of fury. The blood left her face\r\nand surged back in a rush of crimson. You are engaged to be married and\r\nI take it that there exists between you and your _fiancee_ the\r\nutmost love and trust and understanding; but would you have the nerve,\r\ncould you summon up the cold, callous gall to tell your Genevieve that\r\nshe wasn't capable of using her wooden clubs? I think not. Yet this was\r\nwhat Ramsden Waters had told Eunice, and the delicately nurtured girl\r\nstaggered before the coarse insult. Her refined, sensitive nature was\r\nall churned up.\r\n\r\nEver since she had made her first drive at golf, she had prided herself\r\non her use of the wood. Her brother and her brassey were the only\r\nthings she loved. And here was this man deliberately.... Eunice choked.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Waters!\"\r\n\r\nBefore they could have further speech George Perkins and little\r\nWilberforce ambled in a bloated way out of the clubhouse.\r\n\r\n\"I've had three ginger ales,\" observed the boy. \"Where do we go from\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our honour,\" said Ramsden. \"Shoot!\"\r\n\r\nEunice took out her driver without a word. Her little figure was tense\r\nwith emotion. She swung vigorously, and pulled the ball far out on to\r\nthe fairway of the ninth hole.\r\n\r\n\"Even off the tee,\" said Ramsden, \"you had better use an iron. You must\r\nkeep 'em straight.\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met. Hers were glittering with the fury of a woman scorned.\r\nHis were cold and hard. And, suddenly, as she looked at his awful,\r\npale, set golf face, something seemed to snap in Eunice. A strange\r\nsensation of weakness and humility swept over her. So might the cave\r\nwoman have felt when, with her back against a cliff and unable to\r\ndodge, she watched her suitor take his club in the interlocking grip,\r\nand, after a preliminary waggle, start his back swing.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that, all her life, Eunice had been accustomed to the\r\nhomage of men. From the time she had put her hair up every man she had\r\nmet had grovelled before her, and she had acquired a mental attitude\r\ntoward the other sex which was a blend of indifference and contempt.\r\nFor the cringing specimens who curled up and died all over the\r\nhearthrug if she spoke a cold word to them she had nothing but scorn.\r\nShe dreamed wistfully of those brusque cavemen of whom she read in the\r\nnovels which she took out of the village circulating library. The\r\nfemale novelist who was at that time her favourite always supplied with\r\neach chunk of wholesome and invigorating fiction one beetle-browed hero\r\nwith a grouch and a scowl, who rode wild horses over the countryside\r\ntill they foamed at the mouth, and treated women like dirt. That,\r\nEunice had thought yearningly, as she talked to youths whose spines\r\nturned to gelatine at one glance from her bright eyes, was the sort of\r\nman she wanted to meet and never seemed to come across.\r\n\r\nOf all the men whose acquaintance she had made recently she had\r\ndespised Ramsden Waters most. Where others had grovelled he had tied\r\nhimself into knots. Where others had gazed at her like sheep he had\r\ngoggled at her like a kicked spaniel. She had only permitted him to\r\nhang round because he seemed so fond of little Wilberforce. And here he\r\nwas, ordering her about and piercing her with gimlet eyes, for all the\r\nworld as if he were Claude Delamere, in the thirty-second chapter of\r\n\"The Man of Chilled Steel\", the one where Claude drags Lady Matilda\r\naround the smoking-room by her hair because she gave the rose from her\r\nbouquet to the Italian count.\r\n\r\nShe was half-cowed, half-resentful.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Winklethorpe told me I was very good with the wooden clubs,\" she\r\nsaid defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"He's a great kidder,\" said Ramsden.\r\n\r\nHe went down the hill to where his ball lay. Eunice proceeded direct\r\nfor the green. Much as she told herself that she hated this man, she\r\nnever questioned his ability to get there with his next shot.\r\n\r\nGeorge Perkins, who had long since forfeited any confidence which his\r\npartner might have reposed in him, had topped his drive, leaving Miss\r\nBingley a difficult second out of a sandy ditch. The hole was halved.\r\n\r\nThe match went on. Ramsden won the short hole, laying his ball dead\r\nwith a perfect iron shot, but at the next, the long dog-leg hole, Miss\r\nBingley regained the honour. They came to the last all square.\r\n\r\nAs the match had started on the tenth tee, the last hole to be\r\nnegotiated was, of course, what in the ordinary run of human affairs is\r\nthe ninth, possibly the trickiest on the course. As you know, it is\r\nnecessary to carry with one's initial wallop that combination of stream\r\nand lake into which so many well meant drives have flopped. This done,\r\nthe player proceeds up the face of a steep slope, to find himself\r\nultimately on a green which looks like the sea in the storm scene of a\r\nmelodrama. It heaves and undulates, and is altogether a nasty thing to\r\nhave happen to one at the end of a gruelling match. But it is the first\r\nshot, the drive, which is the real test, for the water and the trees\r\nform a mental hazard of unquestionable toughness.\r\n\r\nGeorge Perkins, as he addressed his ball for the vital stroke,\r\nmanifestly wabbled. He was scared to the depths of his craven soul. He\r\ntried to pray, but all he could remember was the hymn for those in\r\nperil on the deep, into which category, he feared, his ball would\r\nshortly fall. Breathing a few bars of this, he swung. There was a\r\nmusical click, and the ball, singing over the water like a bird,\r\nbreasted the hill like a homing aeroplane and fell in the centre of the\r\nfairway within easy distance of the plateau green.\r\n\r\n\"Nice work, partner,\" said Miss Bingley, speaking for the first and\r\nlast time in the course of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nGeorge unravelled himself with a modest simper. He felt like a gambler\r\nwho has placed his all on a number at roulette and sees the white ball\r\ntumble into the correct compartment.\r\n\r\nEunice moved to the tee. In the course of the last eight holes the\r\ngirl's haughty soul had been rudely harrowed. She had foozled two\r\ndrives and three approach shots and had missed a short putt on the last\r\ngreen but three. She had that consciousness of sin which afflicts the\r\ngolfer off his game, that curious self-loathing which humbles the\r\nproudest. Her knees felt weak and all nature seemed to bellow at her\r\nthat this was where she was going to blow up with a loud report.\r\n\r\nEven as her driver rose above her shoulder she was acutely aware that\r\nshe was making eighteen out of the twenty-three errors which complicate\r\nthe drive at golf. She knew that her head had swayed like some\r\nbeautiful flower in a stiff breeze. The heel of her left foot was\r\npointing down the course. Her grip had shifted, and her wrists felt\r\nlike sticks of boiled asparagus. As the club began to descend she\r\nperceived that she had underestimated the total of her errors. And when\r\nthe ball, badly topped, bounded down the slope and entered the muddy\r\nwater like a timid diver on a cold morning she realized that she had a\r\nfull hand. There are twenty-three things which it is possible to do\r\nwrong in the drive, and she had done them all.\r\n\r\nSilently Ramsden Waters made a tee and placed thereon a new ball. He\r\nwas a golfer who rarely despaired, but he was playing three, and his\r\nopponents' ball would undoubtedly be on the green, possibly even dead,\r\nin two. Nevertheless, perhaps, by a supreme drive, and one or two\r\nmiracles later on, the game might be saved. He concentrated his whole\r\nsoul on the ball.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely tell you that Ramsden Waters pressed....\r\n\r\nSwish came the driver. The ball, fanned by the wind, rocked a little on\r\nthe tee, then settled down in its original position. Ramsden Waters,\r\nusually the most careful of players, had missed the globe.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was a silence--a silence which Ramsden had to strive\r\nwith an effort almost physically painful not to break. Rich oaths\r\nsurged to his lips, and blistering maledictions crashed against the\r\nback of his clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nThe silence was broken by little Wilberforce.\r\n\r\nOne can only gather that there lurks in the supposedly innocuous amber\r\nof ginger ale an elevating something which the temperance reformers\r\nhave overlooked. Wilberforce Bray had, if you remember, tucked away no\r\nfewer than three in the spot where they would do most good. One\r\npresumes that the child, with all that stuff surging about inside him,\r\nhad become thoroughly above himself. He uttered a merry laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Never hit it!\" said little Wilberforce.\r\n\r\nHe was kneeling beside the tee box as he spoke, and now, as one who has\r\nseen all that there is to be seen and turns, sated, to other\r\namusements, he moved round and began to play with the sand. The\r\nspectacle of his alluring trouser seat was one which a stronger man\r\nwould have found it hard to resist. To Ramsden Waters it had the aspect\r\nof a formal invitation. For one moment his number II golf shoe, as\r\nsupplied to all the leading professionals, wavered in mid-air, then\r\ncrashed home.\r\n\r\nEunice screamed.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you kick my brother!\"\r\n\r\nRamsden faced her, stern and pale.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"in similar circumstances I would have kicked the\r\nArchangel Gabriel!\"\r\n\r\nThen, stooping to his ball, he picked it up.\r\n\r\n\"The match is yours,\" he said to Miss Bingley, who, having paid no\r\nattention at all to the drama which had just concluded, was practising\r\nshort chip shots with her mashie-niblick.\r\n\r\nHe bowed coldly to Eunice, cast one look of sombre satisfaction at\r\nlittle Wilberforce, who was painfully extricating himself from a bed of\r\nnettles into which he had rolled, and strode off. He crossed the bridge\r\nover the water and stalked up the hill.\r\n\r\nEunice watched him go, spellbound. Her momentary spurt of wrath at the\r\nkicking of her brother had died away, and she wished she had thought of\r\ndoing it herself.\r\n\r\nHow splendid he looked, she felt, as she watched Ramsden striding up to\r\nthe club-house--just like Carruthers Mordyke after he had flung\r\nErmyntrude Vanstone from him in chapter forty-one of \"Gray Eyes That\r\nGleam\". Her whole soul went out to him. This was the sort of man she\r\nwanted as a partner in life. How grandly he would teach her to play\r\ngolf. It had sickened her when her former instructors, prefacing their\r\ncriticism with glutinous praise, had mildly suggested that some people\r\nfound it a good thing to keep the head still when driving and that\r\nthough her methods were splendid it might be worth trying. They had\r\nspoken of her keeping her eye on the ball as if she were doing the ball\r\na favour. What she wanted was a great, strong, rough brute of a fellow\r\nwho would tell her not to move her damned head; a rugged Viking of a\r\nchap who, if she did not keep her eye on the ball, would black it for\r\nher. And Ramsden Waters was such a one. He might not look like a\r\nViking, but after all it is the soul that counts and, as this\r\nafternoon's experience had taught her, Ramsden Waters had a soul that\r\nseemed to combine in equal proportions the outstanding characteristics\r\nof Nero, a wildcat, and the second mate of a tramp steamer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night Ramsden Walters sat in his study, a prey to the gloomiest\r\nemotions. The gold had died out of him by now, and he was reproaching\r\nhimself bitterly for having ruined for ever his chance of winning the\r\nonly girl he had ever loved. How could she forgive him for his\r\nbrutality? How could she overlook treatment which would have caused\r\ncomment in the stokehold of a cattle ship? He groaned and tried to\r\nforget his sorrows by forcing himself to read.\r\n\r\nBut the choicest thoughts of the greatest writers had no power to grip\r\nhim. He tried Vardon \"On the Swing\", and the words swam before his\r\neyes. He turned to Taylor \"On the Chip Shot\", and the master's pure\r\nstyle seemed laboured and involved. He found solace neither in Braid\r\n\"On the Pivot\" nor in Duncan \"On the Divot\". He was just about to give\r\nit up and go to bed though it was only nine o'clock, when the telephone\r\nbell rang.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Mr. Waters? This is Eunice Bray.\" The receiver shook in\r\nRamsden's hand. \"I've just remembered. Weren't we talking about\r\nsomething last night? Didn't you ask me to marry you or something? I\r\nknow it was something.\"\r\n\r\nRamsden gulped three times.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" he replied hollowly.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't settle anything, did we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, we sort of left it kind of open.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yuk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, would it bore you awfully,\" said Eunice's soft voice, \"to come\r\nround now and go on talking it over?\"\r\n\r\nRamsden tottered.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be quite alone,\" said Eunice. \"Little Wilberforce has gone to\r\nbed with a headache.\"\r\n\r\nRamsden paused a moment to disentangle his tongue from the back of his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be right over!\" he said huskily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n_The Coming of Gowf_\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\n\r\nAfter we had sent in our card and waited for a few hours in the marbled\r\nante-room, a bell rang and the major-domo, parting the priceless\r\ncurtains, ushered us in to where the editor sat writing at his desk. We\r\nadvanced on all fours, knocking our head reverently on the Aubusson\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" he said at length, laying down his jewelled pen.\r\n\r\n\"We just looked in,\" we said, humbly, \"to ask if it would be all right\r\nif we sent you an historical story.\"\r\n\r\n\"The public does not want historical stories,\" he said, frowning\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but the public hasn't seen one of ours!\" we replied.\r\n\r\nThe editor placed a cigarette in a holder presented to him by a\r\nreigning monarch, and lit it with a match from a golden box, the gift\r\nof the millionaire president of the Amalgamated League of Working\r\nPlumbers.\r\n\r\n\"What this magazine requires,\" he said, \"is red-blooded,\r\none-hundred-per-cent dynamic stuff, palpitating with warm human\r\ninterest and containing a strong, poignant love-motive.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" we replied, \"is us all over, Mabel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I need at the moment, however, is a golf story.\"\r\n\r\n\"By a singular coincidence, ours is a golf story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! say you so?\" said the editor, a flicker of interest passing over\r\nhis finely-chiselled features. \"Then you may let me see it.\"\r\n\r\nHe kicked us in the face, and we withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY\r\n\r\nOn the broad terrace outside his palace, overlooking the fair expanse\r\nof the Royal gardens, King Merolchazzar of Oom stood leaning on the low\r\nparapet, his chin in his hand and a frown on his noble face. The day\r\nwas fine, and a light breeze bore up to him from the garden below a\r\nfragrant scent of flowers. But, for all the pleasure it seemed to give\r\nhim, it might have been bone-fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, King Merolchazzar was in love, and his suit was not\r\nprospering. Enough to upset any man.\r\n\r\nRoyal love affairs in those days were conducted on the correspondence\r\nsystem. A monarch, hearing good reports of a neighbouring princess,\r\nwould despatch messengers with gifts to her Court, beseeching an\r\ninterview. The Princess would name a date, and a formal meeting would\r\ntake place; after which everything usually buzzed along pretty\r\nsmoothly. But in the case of King Merolchazzar's courtship of the\r\nPrincess of the Outer Isles there had been a regrettable hitch. She had\r\nacknowledged the gifts, saying that they were just what she had wanted\r\nand how had he guessed, and had added that, as regarded a meeting, she\r\nwould let him know later. Since that day no word had come from her, and\r\na gloomy spirit prevailed in the capital. At the Courtiers' Club, the\r\nmeeting-place of the aristocracy of Oom, five to one in _pazazas_\r\nwas freely offered against Merolchazzar's chances, but found no takers;\r\nwhile in the taverns of the common people, where less conservative odds\r\nwere always to be had, you could get a snappy hundred to eight. \"For in\r\ngood sooth,\" writes a chronicler of the time on a half-brick and a\r\ncouple of paving-stones which have survived to this day, \"it did indeed\r\nbegin to appear as though our beloved monarch, the son of the sun and\r\nthe nephew of the moon, had been handed the bitter fruit of the\r\ncitron.\"\r\n\r\nThe quaint old idiom is almost untranslatable, but one sees what he\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the King stood sombrely surveying the garden, his attention was\r\nattracted by a small, bearded man with bushy eyebrows and a face like a\r\nwalnut, who stood not far away on a gravelled path flanked by rose\r\nbushes. For some minutes he eyed this man in silence, then he called to\r\nthe Grand Vizier, who was standing in the little group of courtiers and\r\nofficials at the other end of the terrace. The bearded man, apparently\r\nunconscious of the Royal scrutiny, had placed a rounded stone on the\r\ngravel, and was standing beside it making curious passes over it with\r\nhis hoe. It was this singular behaviour that had attracted the King's\r\nattention. Superficially it seemed silly, and yet Merolchazzar had a\r\ncurious feeling that there was a deep, even a holy, meaning behind the\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\"Who,\" he inquired, \"is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is one of your Majesty's gardeners,\" replied the Vizier.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember seeing him before. Who is he?\"\r\n\r\nThe Vizier was a kind-hearted man, and he hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"It seems a hard thing to say of anyone, your Majesty,\" he replied,\r\n\"but he is a Scotsman. One of your Majesty's invincible admirals\r\nrecently made a raid on the inhospitable coast of that country at a\r\nspot known to the natives as S'nandrews and brought away this man.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he think he's doing?\" asked the King, as the bearded one\r\nslowly raised the hoe above his right shoulder, slightly bending the\r\nleft knee as he did so.\r\n\r\n\"It is some species of savage religious ceremony, your Majesty.\r\nAccording to the admiral, the dunes by the seashore where he landed\r\nwere covered with a multitude of men behaving just as this man is\r\ndoing. They had sticks in their hands and they struck with these at\r\nsmall round objects. And every now and again----\"\r\n\r\n\"Fo-o-ore!\" called a gruff voice from below.\r\n\r\n\"And every now and again,\" went on the Vizier, \"they would utter the\r\nstrange melancholy cry which you have just heard. It is a species of\r\nchant.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vizier broke off. The hoe had descended on the stone, and the\r\nstone, rising in a graceful arc, had sailed through the air and fallen\r\nwithin a foot of where the King stood.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\" exclaimed the Vizier.\r\n\r\nThe man looked up.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't do that! You nearly hit his serene graciousness the King!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mphm!\" said the bearded man, nonchalantly, and began to wave his hoe\r\nmystically over another stone.\r\n\r\nInto the King's careworn face there had crept a look of interest,\r\nalmost of excitement.\r\n\r\n\"What god does he hope to propitiate by these rites?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The deity, I learn from your Majesty's admiral is called Gowf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gowf? Gowf?\" King Merolchazzar ran over in his mind the muster-roll of\r\nthe gods of Oom. There were sixty-seven of them, but Gowf was not of\r\ntheir number. \"It is a strange religion,\" he murmured. \"A strange\r\nreligion, indeed. But, by Belus, distinctly attractive. I have an idea\r\nthat Oom could do with a religion like that. It has a zip to it. A sort\r\nof fascination, if you know what I mean. It looks to me extraordinarily\r\nlike what the Court physician ordered. I will talk to this fellow and\r\nlearn more of these holy ceremonies.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, followed by the Vizier, the King made his way into the garden. The\r\nVizier was now in a state of some apprehension. He was exercised in his\r\nmind as to the effect which the embracing of a new religion by the King\r\nmight have on the formidable Church party. It would be certain to cause\r\ndispleasure among the priesthood; and in those days it was a ticklish\r\nbusiness to offend the priesthood, even for a monarch. And, if\r\nMerolchazzar had a fault, it was a tendency to be a little tactless in\r\nhis dealings with that powerful body. Only a few mornings back the High\r\nPriest of Hec had taken the Vizier aside to complain about the quality\r\nof the meat which the King had been using lately for his sacrifices. He\r\nmight be a child in worldly matters, said the High Priest, but if the\r\nKing supposed that he did not know the difference between home-grown\r\ndomestic and frozen imported foreign, it was time his Majesty was\r\ndisabused of the idea. If, on top of this little unpleasantness, King\r\nMerolchazzar were to become an adherent of this new Gowf, the Vizier\r\ndid not know what might not happen.\r\n\r\nThe King stood beside the bearded foreigner, watching him closely. The\r\nsecond stone soared neatly on to the terrace. Merolchazzar uttered an\r\nexcited cry. His eyes were glowing, and he breathed quickly.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't look difficult,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"Hoo's!\" said the bearded man.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I could do it,\" went on the King, feverishly. \"By the eight\r\ngreen gods of the mountain, I believe I could! By the holy fire that\r\nburns night and day before the altar of Belus, I'm _sure_ I could!\r\nBy Hec, I'm going to do it now! Gimme that hoe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Toots!\" said the bearded man.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the King that the fellow spoke derisively, and his blood\r\nboiled angrily. He seized the hoe and raised it above his shoulder,\r\nbracing himself solidly on widely-parted feet. His pose was an exact\r\nreproduction of the one in which the Court sculptor had depicted him\r\nwhen working on the life-size statue (\"Our Athletic King\") which stood\r\nin the principal square of the city; but it did not impress the\r\nstranger. He uttered a discordant laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Ye puir gonuph!\" he cried, \"whitkin' o' a staunce is that?\"\r\n\r\nThe King was hurt. Hitherto the attitude had been generally admired.\r\n\r\n\"It's the way I always stand when killing lions,\" he said. \"'In killing\r\nlions,'\" he added, quoting from the well-known treatise of Nimrod, the\r\nrecognized text-book on the sport, \"'the weight at the top of the swing\r\nshould be evenly balanced on both feet.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, weel, ye're no killing lions the noo. Ye're gowfing.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden humility descended upon the King. He felt, as so many men were\r\nto feel in similar circumstances in ages to come, as though he were a\r\nchild looking eagerly for guidance to an all-wise master--a child,\r\nmoreover, handicapped by water on the brain, feet three sizes too large\r\nfor him, and hands consisting mainly of thumbs.\r\n\r\n\"O thou of noble ancestors and agreeable disposition!\" he said, humbly.\r\n\"Teach me the true way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Use the interlocking grup and keep the staunce a wee bit open and slow\r\nback, and dinna press or sway the heid and keep yer e'e on the ba'.\"\r\n\r\n\"My which on the what?\" said the King, bewildered.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy, your Majesty,\" hazarded the Vizier, \"that he is respectfully\r\nsuggesting that your serene graciousness should deign to keep your eye\r\non the ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ah!\" said the King.\r\n\r\nThe first golf lesson ever seen in the kingdom of Oom had begun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp on the terrace, meanwhile, in the little group of courtiers and\r\nofficials, a whispered consultation was in progress. Officially, the\r\nKing's unfortunate love affair was supposed to be a strict secret. But\r\nyou know how it is. These things get about. The Grand Vizier tells the\r\nLord High Chamberlain; the Lord High Chamberlain whispers it in\r\nconfidence to the Supreme Hereditary Custodian of the Royal Pet Dog;\r\nthe Supreme Hereditary Custodian hands it on to the Exalted Overseer of\r\nthe King's Wardrobe on the understanding that it is to go no farther;\r\nand, before you know where you are, the varlets and scurvy knaves are\r\ngossiping about it in the kitchens, and the Society journalists have\r\nstarted to carve it out on bricks for the next issue of _Palace\r\nPrattlings_.\r\n\r\n\"The long and short of it is,\" said the Exalted Overseer of the King's\r\nWardrobe, \"we must cheer him up.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of approval. In those days of easy executions it was\r\nno light matter that a monarch should be a prey to gloom.\r\n\r\n\"But how?\" queried the Lord High Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said the Supreme Hereditary Custodian of the Royal Pet Dog.\r\n\"Try him with the minstrels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here! Why us?\" protested the leader of the minstrels.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly!\" said the Lord High Chamberlain. \"It's for your good\r\njust as much as ours. He was asking only last night why he never got\r\nany music nowadays. He told me to find out whether you supposed he paid\r\nyou simply to eat and sleep, because if so he knew what to do about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, in that case!\" The leader of the minstrels started nervously.\r\nCollecting his assistants and tip-toeing down the garden, he took up\r\nhis stand a few feet in Merolchazzar's rear, just as that much-enduring\r\nmonarch, after twenty-five futile attempts, was once more addressing\r\nhis stone.\r\n\r\nLyric writers in those days had not reached the supreme pitch of\r\nexcellence which has been produced by modern musical comedy. The art\r\nwas in its infancy then, and the best the minstrels could do was\r\nthis--and they did it just as Merolchazzar, raising the hoe with\r\npainful care, reached the top of his swing and started down:\r\n\r\n    _\"Oh, tune the string and let us sing\r\n    Our godlike, great, and glorious King!\r\n      He's a bear! He's a bear! He's a bear!\"_\r\n\r\nThere were sixteen more verses, touching on their ruler's prowess in\r\nthe realms of sport and war, but they were not destined to be sung on\r\nthat circuit. King Merolchazzar jumped like a stung bullock, lifted his\r\nhead, and missed the globe for the twenty-sixth time. He spun round on\r\nthe minstrels, who were working pluckily through their song of praise:\r\n\r\n    _\"Oh, may his triumphs never cease!\r\n      He has the strength of ten!\r\n    First in war, first in peace,\r\n      First in the hearts of his countrymen.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\" roared the King.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty?\" quavered the leader of the minstrels.\r\n\r\n\"Make a noise like an egg and beat it!\" (Again one finds the\r\nchronicler's idiom impossible to reproduce in modern speech, and must\r\nbe content with a literal translation.) \"By the bones of my ancestors,\r\nit's a little hard! By the beard of the sacred goat, it's tough! What\r\nin the name of Belus and Hec do you mean, you yowling misfits, by\r\nstarting that sort of stuff when a man's swinging? I was just shaping\r\nto hit it right that time when you butted in, you----\"\r\n\r\nThe minstrels melted away. The bearded man patted the fermenting\r\nmonarch paternally on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Ma mannie,\" he said, \"ye may no' be a gowfer yet, but hoots! ye're\r\nlearning the language fine!\"\r\n\r\nKing Merolchazzar's fury died away. He simpered modestly at these words\r\nof commendation, the first his bearded preceptor had uttered. With\r\nexemplary patience he turned to address the stone for the\r\ntwenty-seventh time.\r\n\r\nThat night it was all over the city that the King had gone crazy over a\r\nnew religion, and the orthodox shook their heads.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe of the present day, living in the midst of a million marvels of a\r\ncomplex civilization, have learned to adjust ourselves to conditions\r\nand to take for granted phenomena which in an earlier and less advanced\r\nage would have caused the profoundest excitement and even alarm. We\r\naccept without comment the telephone, the automobile, and the wireless\r\ntelegraph, and we are unmoved by the spectacle of our fellow human\r\nbeings in the grip of the first stages of golf fever. Far otherwise was\r\nit with the courtiers and officials about the Palace of Oom. The\r\nobsession of the King was the sole topic of conversation.\r\n\r\nEvery day now, starting forth at dawn and returning only with the\r\nfalling of darkness, Merolchazzar was out on the Linx, as the outdoor\r\ntemple of the new god was called. In a luxurious house adjoining this\r\nexpanse the bearded Scotsman had been installed, and there he could be\r\nfound at almost any hour of the day fashioning out of holy wood the\r\nweird implements indispensable to the new religion. As a recognition of\r\nhis services, the King had bestowed upon him a large pension,\r\ninnumerable _kaddiz_ or slaves, and the title of Promoter of the\r\nKing's Happiness, which for the sake of convenience was generally\r\nshortened to The Pro.\r\n\r\nAt present, Oom being a conservative country, the worship of the new\r\ngod had not attracted the public in great numbers. In fact, except for\r\nthe Grand Vizier, who, always a faithful follower of his sovereign's\r\nfortunes, had taken to Gowf from the start, the courtiers held aloof to\r\na man. But the Vizier had thrown himself into the new worship with such\r\nvigour and earnestness that it was not long before he won from the King\r\nthe title of Supreme Splendiferous Maintainer of the Twenty-Four\r\nHandicap Except on Windy Days when It Goes Up to Thirty--a title which\r\nin ordinary conversation was usually abbreviated to The Dub.\r\n\r\nAll these new titles, it should be said, were, so far as the courtiers\r\nwere concerned, a fruitful source of discontent. There were black looks\r\nand mutinous whispers. The laws of precedence were being disturbed, and\r\nthe courtiers did not like it. It jars a man who for years has had his\r\nsocial position all cut and dried--a man, to take an instance at\r\nrandom, who, as Second Deputy Shiner of the Royal Hunting Boots, knows\r\nthat his place is just below the Keeper of the Eel-Hounds and just\r\nabove the Second Tenor of the Corps of Minstrels--it jars him, we say,\r\nto find suddenly that he has got to go down a step in favour of the\r\nHereditary Bearer of the King's Baffy.\r\n\r\nBut it was from the priesthood that the real, serious opposition was to\r\nbe expected. And the priests of the sixty-seven gods of Oom were up in\r\narms. As the white-bearded High Priest of Hec, who by virtue of his\r\noffice was generally regarded as leader of the guild, remarked in a\r\nglowing speech at an extraordinary meeting of the Priests' Equity\r\nAssociation, he had always set his face against the principle of the\r\nClosed Shop hitherto, but there were moments when every thinking man\r\nhad to admit that enough was sufficient, and it was his opinion that\r\nsuch a moment had now arrived. The cheers which greeted the words\r\nshowed how correctly he had voiced popular sentiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all those who had listened to the High Priest's speech, none had\r\nlistened more intently than the King's half-brother, Ascobaruch. A\r\nsinister, disappointed man, this Ascobaruch, with mean eyes and a\r\ncrafty smile. All his life he had been consumed with ambition, and\r\nuntil now it had looked as though he must go to his grave with this\r\nambition unfulfilled. All his life he had wanted to be King of Oom, and\r\nnow he began to see daylight. He was sufficiently versed in Court\r\nintrigues to be aware that the priests were the party that really\r\ncounted, the source from which all successful revolutions sprang. And\r\nof all the priests the one that mattered most was the venerable High\r\nPriest of Hec.\r\n\r\nIt was to this prelate, therefore, that Ascobaruch made his way at the\r\nclose of the proceedings. The meeting had dispersed after passing a\r\nunanimous vote of censure on King Merolchazzar, and the High Priest was\r\nrefreshing himself in the vestry--for the meeting had taken place in\r\nthe Temple of Hec--with a small milk and honey.\r\n\r\n\"Some speech!\" began Ascobaruch in his unpleasant, crafty way. None\r\nknew better than he the art of appealing to human vanity.\r\n\r\nThe High Priest was plainly gratified.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" he said, modestly.\r\n\r\n\"Yessir!\" said Ascobaruch. \"Considerable oration! What I can never\r\nunderstand is how you think up all these things to say. I couldn't do\r\nit if you paid me. The other night I had to propose the Visitors at the\r\nOld Alumni dinner of Oom University, and my mind seemed to go all\r\nblank. But you just stand up and the words come fluttering out of you\r\nlike bees out of a barn. I simply cannot understand it. The thing gets\r\npast me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's just a knack.\"\r\n\r\n\"A divine gift, I should call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you're right,\" said the High Priest, finishing his milk and\r\nhoney. He was wondering why he had never realized before what a capital\r\nfellow Ascobaruch was.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" went on Ascobaruch, \"you had an excellent subject. I mean\r\nto say, inspiring and all that. Why, by Hec, even I--though, of course,\r\nI couldn't have approached your level--even I could have done something\r\nwith a subject like that. I mean, going off and worshipping a new god\r\nno one has ever heard of. I tell you, my blood fairly boiled. Nobody\r\nhas a greater respect and esteem for Merolchazzar than I have, but I\r\nmean to say, what! Not right, I mean, going off worshipping gods no one\r\nhas ever heard of! I'm a peaceable man, and I've made it a rule never\r\nto mix in politics, but if you happened to say to me as we were sitting\r\nhere, just as one reasonable man to another--if you happened to say,\r\n'Ascobaruch, I think it's time that definite steps were taken,' I\r\nshould reply frankly, 'My dear old High Priest, I absolutely agree with\r\nyou, and I'm with you all the way.' You might even go so far as to\r\nsuggest that the only way out of the muddle was to assassinate\r\nMerolchazzar and start with a clean slate.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Priest stroked his beard thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I am bound to say I never thought of going quite so far as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merely a suggestion, of course,\" said Ascobaruch. \"Take it or leave\r\nit. I shan't be offended. If you know a superior excavation, go to it.\r\nBut as a sensible man--and I've always maintained that you are the most\r\nsensible man in the country--you must see that it would be a solution.\r\nMerolchazzar has been a pretty good king, of course. No one denies\r\nthat. A fair general, no doubt, and a plus-man at lion-hunting. But,\r\nafter all--look at it fairly--is life all battles and lion-hunting?\r\nIsn't there a deeper side? Wouldn't it be better for the country to\r\nhave some good orthodox fellow who has worshipped Hec all his life, and\r\ncould be relied on to maintain the old beliefs--wouldn't the fact that\r\na man like that was on the throne be likely to lead to more general\r\nprosperity? There are dozens of men of that kind simply waiting to be\r\nasked. Let us say, purely for purposes of argument, that you approached\r\n_me_. I should reply, 'Unworthy though I know myself to be of such\r\nan honour, I can tell you this. If you put me on the throne, you can\r\nbet your bottom _pazaza_ that there's one thing that won't suffer,\r\nand that is the worship of Hec!' That's the way I feel about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Priest pondered.\r\n\r\n\"O thou of unshuffled features but amiable disposition!\" he said, \"thy\r\ndiscourse soundeth good to me. Could it be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could it!\" Ascobaruch uttered a hideous laugh. \"Could it! Arouse me in\r\nthe night-watches and ask me! Question me on the matter, having stopped\r\nme for that purpose on the public highway! What I would suggest--I'm\r\nnot dictating, mind you; merely trying to help you out--what I would\r\nsuggest is that you took that long, sharp knife of yours, the one you\r\nuse for the sacrifices, and toddled out to the Linx--you're sure to\r\nfind the King there; and just when he's raising that sacrilegious stick\r\nof his over his shoulder----\"\r\n\r\n\"O man of infinite wisdom,\" cried the High Priest, warmly, \"verily hast\r\nthem spoken a fullness of the mouth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a wager?\" said Ascobaruch.\r\n\r\n\"It is a wager!\" said the High Priest.\r\n\r\n\"That's that, then,\" said Ascobaruch. \"Now, I don't want to be mixed up\r\nin any unpleasantness, so what I think I'll do while what you might\r\ncall the preliminaries are being arranged is to go and take a little\r\ntrip abroad somewhere. The Middle Lakes are pleasant at this time of\r\nyear. When I come back, it's possible that all the formalities will\r\nhave been completed, yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rely on me, by Hec!\" said the High Priest grimly, as he fingered his\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe High Priest was as good as his word. Early on the morrow he made\r\nhis way to the Linx, and found the King holing-out on the second green.\r\nMerolchazzar was in high good humour.\r\n\r\n\"Greetings, O venerable one!\" he cried, jovially. \"Hadst thou come a\r\nmoment sooner, them wouldst have seen me lay my ball dead--aye, dead as\r\nmutton, with the sweetest little half-mashie-niblick chip-shot ever\r\nseen outside the sacred domain of S'nandrew, on whom\"--he bared his\r\nhead reverently--\"be peace! In one under bogey did I do the hole--yea,\r\nand that despite the fact that, slicing my drive, I became ensnared in\r\nyonder undergrowth.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Priest had not the advantage of understanding one word of what\r\nthe King was talking about, but he gathered with satisfaction that\r\nMerolchazzar was pleased and wholly without suspicion. He clasped an\r\nunseen hand more firmly about the handle of his knife, and accompanied\r\nthe monarch to the next altar. Merolchazzar stooped, and placed a small\r\nround white object on a little mound of sand. In spite of his austere\r\nviews, the High Priest, always a keen student of ritual, became\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\"Why does your Majesty do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tee it up that it may fly the fairer. If I did not, then would it be\r\napt to run along the ground like a beetle instead of soaring like a\r\nbird, and mayhap, for thou seest how rough and tangled is the grass\r\nbefore us, I should have to use a niblick for my second.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Priest groped for his meaning.\r\n\r\n\"It is a ceremony to propitiate the god and bring good luck?\"\r\n\r\n\"You might call it that.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Priest shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I may be old-fashioned,\" he said, \"but I should have thought that, to\r\npropitiate a god, it would have been better to have sacrificed one of\r\nthese _kaddiz_ on his altar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" replied the King, thoughtfully, \"that I have often felt\r\nthat it would be a relief to one's feelings to sacrifice one or two\r\n_kaddiz_, but The Pro for some reason or other has set his face\r\nagainst it.\" He swung at the ball, and sent it forcefully down the\r\nfairway. \"By Abe, the son of Mitchell,\" he cried, shading his eyes, \"a\r\nbird of a drive! How truly is it written in the book of the prophet\r\nVadun, 'The left hand applieth the force, the right doth but guide.\r\nGrip not, therefore, too closely with the right hand!' Yesterday I was\r\npulling all the time.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Priest frowned.\r\n\r\n\"It is written in the sacred book of Hec, your Majesty, 'Thou shalt not\r\nfollow after strange gods'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take thou this stick, O venerable one,\" said the King, paying no\r\nattention to the remark, \"and have a shot thyself. True, thou art well\r\nstricken in years, but many a man has so wrought that he was able to\r\ngive his grandchildren a stroke a hole. It is never too late to begin.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Priest shrank back, horrified. The King frowned.\r\n\r\n\"It is our Royal wish,\" he said, coldly.\r\n\r\nThe High Priest was forced to comply. Had they been alone, it is\r\npossible that he might have risked all on one swift stroke with his\r\nknife, but by this time a group of _kaddiz_ had drifted up, and\r\nwere watching the proceedings with that supercilious detachment so\r\ncharacteristic of them. He took the stick and arranged his limbs as the\r\nKing directed.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Merolchazzar, \"slow back and keep your e'e on the ba'!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA month later, Ascobaruch returned from his trip. He had received no\r\nword from the High Priest announcing the success of the revolution, but\r\nthere might be many reasons for that. It was with unruffled contentment\r\nthat he bade his charioteer drive him to the palace. He was glad to get\r\nback, for after all a holiday is hardly a holiday if you have left your\r\nbusiness affairs unsettled.\r\n\r\nAs he drove, the chariot passed a fair open space, on the outskirts of\r\nthe city. A sudden chill froze the serenity of Ascobaruch's mood. He\r\nprodded the charioteer sharply in the small of the back.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" he demanded, catching his breath.\r\n\r\nAll over the green expanse could be seen men in strange robes, moving\r\nto and fro in couples and bearing in their hands mystic wands. Some\r\nsearched restlessly in the bushes, others were walking briskly in the\r\ndirection of small red flags. A sickening foreboding of disaster fell\r\nupon Ascobaruch.\r\n\r\nThe charioteer seemed surprised at the question.\r\n\r\n\"Yon's the muneecipal linx,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"The what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The muneecipal linx.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, fellow, why do you talk that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whitway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, like that. The way you're talking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hoots, mon!\" said the charioteer. \"His Majesty King Merolchazzar--may\r\nhis handicap decrease!--hae passit a law that a' his soobjects shall do\r\nit. Aiblins, 'tis the language spoken by The Pro, on whom be peace!\r\nMphm!\"\r\n\r\nAscobaruch sat back limply, his head swimming. The chariot drove on,\r\ntill now it took the road adjoining the royal Linx. A wall lined a\r\nportion of this road, and suddenly, from behind this wall, there rent\r\nthe air a great shout of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Pull up!\" cried Ascobaruch to the charioteer.\r\n\r\nHe had recognized that laugh. It was the laugh of Merolchazzar.\r\n\r\nAscobaruch crept to the wall and cautiously poked his head over it. The\r\nsight he saw drove the blood from his face and left him white and\r\nhaggard.\r\n\r\nThe King and the Grand Vizier were playing a foursome against the Pro\r\nand the High Priest of Hec, and the Vizier had just laid the High\r\nPriest a dead stymie.\r\n\r\nAscobaruch tottered to the chariot.\r\n\r\n\"Take me back,\" he muttered, pallidly. \"I've forgotten something!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so golf came to Oom, and with it prosperity unequalled in the whole\r\nhistory of the land. Everybody was happy. There was no more\r\nunemployment. Crime ceased. The chronicler repeatedly refers to it in\r\nhis memoirs as the Golden Age. And yet there remained one man on whom\r\ncomplete felicity had not descended. It was all right while he was\r\nactually on the Linx, but there were blank, dreary stretches of the\r\nnight when King Merolchazzar lay sleepless on his couch and mourned\r\nthat he had nobody to love him.\r\n\r\nOf course, his subjects loved him in a way. A new statue had been\r\nerected in the palace square, showing him in the act of getting out of\r\ncasual water. The minstrels had composed a whole cycle of up-to-date\r\nsongs, commemorating his prowess with the mashie. His handicap was down\r\nto twelve. But these things are not all. A golfer needs a loving wife,\r\nto whom he can describe the day's play through the long evenings. And\r\nthis was just where Merolchazzar's life was empty. No word had come\r\nfrom the Princess of the Outer Isles, and, as he refused to be put off\r\nwith just-as-good substitutes, he remained a lonely man.\r\n\r\nBut one morning, in the early hours of a summer day, as he lay sleeping\r\nafter a disturbed night, Merolchazzar was awakened by the eager hand of\r\nthe Lord High Chamberlain, shaking his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Now what?\" said the King.\r\n\r\n\"Hoots, your Majesty! Glorious news! The Princess of the Outer Isles\r\nwaits without--I mean wi'oot!\"\r\n\r\nThe King sprang from his couch.\r\n\r\n\"A messenger from the Princess at last!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, sire, the Princess herself--that is to say,\" said the Lord\r\nChamberlain, who was an old man and had found it hard to accustom\r\nhimself to the new tongue at his age, \"her ain sel'! And believe me, or\r\nrather, mind ah'm telling ye,\" went on the honest man, joyfully, for he\r\nhad been deeply exercised by his monarch's troubles, \"her Highness is\r\nthe easiest thing to look at these eyes hae ever seen. And you can say\r\nI said it!\"\r\n\r\n\"She is beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, she is, in the best and deepest sense of the word, a\r\npippin!\"\r\n\r\nKing Merolchazzar was groping wildly for his robes.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her to wait!\" he cried. \"Go and amuse her. Ask her riddles! Tell\r\nher anecdotes! Don't let her go. Say I'll be down in a moment. Where in\r\nthe name of Zoroaster is our imperial mesh-knit underwear?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA fair and pleasing sight was the Princess of the Outer Isles as she\r\nstood on the terrace in the clear sunshine of the summer morning,\r\nlooking over the King's gardens. With her delicate little nose she\r\nsniffed the fragrance of the flowers. Her blue eyes roamed over the\r\nrose bushes, and the breeze ruffled the golden curls about her temples.\r\nPresently a sound behind her caused her to turn, and she perceived a\r\ngodlike man hurrying across the terrace pulling up a sock. And at the\r\nsight of him the Princess's heart sang within her like the birds down\r\nin the garden.\r\n\r\n\"Hope I haven't kept you waiting,\" said Merolchazzar, apologetically.\r\nHe, too, was conscious of a strange, wild exhilaration. Truly was this\r\nmaiden, as his Chamberlain had said, noticeably easy on the eyes. Her\r\nbeauty was as water in the desert, as fire on a frosty night, as\r\ndiamonds, rubies, pearls, sapphires, and amethysts.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" said the princess, \"I've been enjoying myself. How passing\r\nbeautiful are thy gardens, O King!\"\r\n\r\n\"My gardens may be passing beautiful,\" said Merolchazzar, earnestly,\r\n\"but they aren't half so passing beautiful as thy eyes. I have dreamed\r\nof thee by night and by day, and I will tell the world I was nowhere\r\nnear it! My sluggish fancy came not within a hundred and fifty-seven\r\nmiles of the reality. Now let the sun dim his face and the moon hide\r\nherself abashed. Now let the flowers bend their heads and the gazelle\r\nof the mountains confess itself a cripple. Princess, your slave!\"\r\n\r\nAnd King Merolchazzar, with that easy grace so characteristic of\r\nRoyalty, took her hand in his and kissed it.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, he gave a start of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"By Hec!\" he exclaimed. \"What hast thou been doing to thyself? Thy hand\r\nis all over little rough places inside. Has some malignant wizard laid\r\na spell upon thee, or what is it?\"\r\n\r\nThe Princess blushed.\r\n\r\n\"If I make that clear to thee,\" she said, \"I shall also make clear why\r\nit was that I sent thee no message all this long while. My time was so\r\noccupied, verily I did not seem to have a moment. The fact is, these\r\nsorenesses are due to a strange, new religion to which I and my\r\nsubjects have but recently become converted. And O that I might make\r\nthee also of the true faith! 'Tis a wondrous tale, my lord. Some two\r\nmoons back there was brought to my Court by wandering pirates a captive\r\nof an uncouth race who dwell in the north. And this man has taught\r\nus----\"\r\n\r\nKing Merolchazzar uttered a loud cry.\r\n\r\n\"By Tom, the son of Morris! Can this truly be so? What is thy\r\nhandicap?\"\r\n\r\nThe Princess stared at him, wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"Truly this is a miracle! Art thou also a worshipper of the great\r\nGowf?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I!\" cried the King. \"Am I!\" He broke off. \"Listen!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the minstrels' room high up in the palace there came the sound of\r\nsinging. The minstrels were practising a new paean of praise--words by\r\nthe Grand Vizier, music by the High Priest of Hec--which they were to\r\nrender at the next full moon at the banquet of the worshippers of Gowf.\r\nThe words came clear and distinct through the still air:\r\n\r\n    _\"Oh, praises let us utter\r\n    To our most glorious King!\r\n    It fairly makes you stutter\r\n    To see him start his swing!\r\n    Success attend his putter!\r\n    And luck be with his drive!\r\n    And may he do each hole in two,\r\n    Although the bogey's five!\"_\r\n\r\nThe voices died away. There was a silence.\r\n\r\n\"If I hadn't missed a two-foot putt, I'd have done the long fifteenth\r\nin four yesterday,\" said the King.\r\n\r\n\"I won the Ladies' Open Championship of the Outer Isles last week,\"\r\nsaid the Princess.\r\n\r\nThey looked into each other's eyes for a long moment. And then, hand in\r\nhand, they walked slowly into the palace.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" we said, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I like it,\" said the editor.\r\n\r\n\"Good egg!\" we murmured.\r\n\r\nThe editor pressed a bell, a single ruby set in a fold of the tapestry\r\nupon the wall. The major-domo appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Give this man a purse of gold,\" said the editor, \"and throw him out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Clicking of Cuthbert, by P.
